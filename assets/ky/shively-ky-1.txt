   (A)   (1)   Any resident of the Commonwealth shall have the right to inspect
public records. The official custodian may require a written application,
signed by the applicant and with his or her name printed legibly on the
application, describing the records to be inspected. The official custodian may
require the applicant to provide a statement in the written application of the
manner in which the applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth as defined in §
34.01.
      (2)   The written application shall be:
         (a)   Hand delivered;
         (b)   Mailed;
         (c)   Sent via facsimile; or
         (d)   Sent via e-mail to the public agency's official custodian of
public records, or his or her designee, at the e-mail address designated in the
public agency's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to KRS 61.876.
      (3)   A public agency shall not require the use of any particular form
for the submission of an open records request, but shall accept for any request
the standardized form developed under KRS 61.876(4). (KRS 61.872 (2))
   (B)   All public records shall be open for inspection by any resident of the
Commonwealth, except as otherwise provided by KRS 61.870 to 61.884, and
suitable facilities shall be made available by each public agency for the
exercise of this right. No resident of the Commonwealth shall remove original
copies of public records from the offices of any public agency without the
written permission of the official custodian of the record. (KRS 61.872(1))
   (C)   A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect the public records:
      (1)   During the regular office hours of the public agency; or
      (2)   By receiving copies of the public records from the public agency
through the mail. The public agency shall mail copies of the public records to
a person whose residence or principal place of business is outside the county
in which the public records are located after he or she precisely describes the
public records which are readily available within the public agency. If the
resident of the Commonwealth requesting the public records requests that copies
of the records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail the copies upon
receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing. (KRS 61.872(3))
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
34.01. (KRS 61.874(1))
   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format.
   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in
standard hard copy format where agencies currently maintain records in hard
copy format. Agencies are not required to convert hard copy format records to
electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6))
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk/Tax Assessor does not have custody or control of the
public record or records requested, the City Clerk/Tax Assessor shall so notify
the applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the custodian of the
public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from
receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is given
for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the public
record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   If a person enforces KRS 61.870 to 61.884 pursuant to this section, he
or she shall begin enforcement under this subsection before proceeding to
enforcement under KRS 61.880(2). Each public agency, upon any request for
records made under KRS 61.870 to 61.884, shall determine within five days,
excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the receipt of any such
request whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the
person making the request, within the five-day period, of its decision. An
agency response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall
include a statement of the specific exception authorizing the withholding of
the record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies to the record
withheld. The response shall be issued by the official custodian or under his
or her authority, and it shall constitute final agency action. (KRS 61.880(1))
   (B)   If a complaining party wishes the Attorney General to review a public
agency's denial of a request to inspect a public record, the complaining party
shall forward to the Attorney General a copy of the written request and a copy
of the written response denying inspection. If the public agency refuses to
provide a written response, a complaining party shall provide a copy of the
written request. The Attorney General shall review the request and denial and
issue within 20 days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, a
written decision stating whether the agency violated provisions of KRS 61.870
to 61.884. (KRS 61.880(2)(a))
   (C)   (1)   A party shall have 30 days from the day that the Attorney
General renders his or her decision to appeal the decision. An appeal within
the 30-day time limit shall be treated as if it were an action brought under
KRS 61.882.
      (2)   If an appeal is not filed within the 30-day time limit, the
Attorney General's decision shall have the force and effect of law and shall be
enforceable in the circuit court of the county where the public agency has its
principal place of business or the circuit court of the county where the public
record is maintained. (KRS 61.880(5))
§ 34.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under

§ 35.39 APPOINTMENTS AND PROMOTIONS.
   (A)   The Mayor shall make all civil service appointments, and the

subsection (E) of this section.
   (B)   Whenever it is imperative to fill a vacancy in classified civil
service before the Commission can certify a list of as many as three persons
eligible for appointment after competitive examination, the Mayor shall
nominate a competent person from the same class or next lower rank to the
Commission for noncompetitive examination, and if certified by the Commission
as qualified after the noncompetitive examination he may be appointed
provisionally to fill the vacancy until an appointment can be made from the
eligible list prepared by the Commission, which eligible list shall be prepared
within 60 days after vacancy.
   (C)   In case of great emergency and when no one upon the eligible list or
by promotion from a lower rank is available, an appointment may be made by the
Mayor without examination, but in no case shall such appointment continue
longer than 45 days, and in no case shall successive appointments be made of
the same person, or other persons, to such vacancy.
   (D)   Temporary appointments made necessary by reason of illness or
disability of regular Police or Fire Department members shall continue only
during the period of disability.
   (E)   Whenever, from any cause, there shall be a vacancy in any of the

classification ranking next highest in seniority, if he chooses, shall succeed
to and fill said vacancy, unless upon charges made by the city that the member
is not qualified to fill the vacancy and after notice and upon trial to
determine his qualifications in the same manner as is now required for the
dismissal, suspension, or reduction in grade or pay of a member under §
35.40, it is established by the city that the member has not the necessary
qualifications to enable him to discharge the duties of the office or position
in which the vacancy occurs. In case of a vacancy in the classified service
where peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a particular professional or
educational character are required, upon satisfactory evidence that for reasons
stated in writing by the Mayor, competitive examination in such a case has
failed to provide an eligible list, the Commission may suspend the provisions
requiring competitive examination under civil service.
   (F)   Where the service to be rendered by an appointee in the classified
service is for a temporary period, and the need of such service is imperative,
the Mayor may select for that temporary service any person on the list of those
eligible for permanent appointment. Successive temporary appointments to the
same position shall not be made under this provision. The acceptance or refusal
by an eligible applicant of a temporary appointment shall not affect his
standing on the register for permanent employment, nor shall temporary service
be counted as part of the probationary service in case of subsequent
appointment to a permanent position.
   (G)   No person shall be certified by the Commission from an eligible list
more than four times to the same appointing authority for the same or similar
position.
   (H)   The Mayor may provide that all appointments for initial permanent
employment may be probationary appointments for a period of not more than 12
months, after which probationary period regular appointments shall be given to
all probationary Police and Fire Department members who are deemed to be
satisfactory by the Mayor.

§ 35.40 DISMISSAL, SUSPENSION, OR REDUCTION.
   (A)   No Police or Fire Department member in the classified service shall be
dismissed, suspended, or reduced in grade or pay for any reason except
inefficiency, misconduct, insubordination, violation of any law involving moral
turpitude, or violation of any rule adopted by the City Council or Civil
Service Commission.
   (B)   Any person may prefer charges in writing against any Police or Fire
Department member in the classified service by filing them with the Mayor, who
shall communicate the charges without delay to the Civil Service Commission.
The charges must be signed by the person making them and must set out clearly
each charge. The Mayor shall, whenever probable cause appears, prefer charges
against any Police or Fire Department member in the classified service whom he
believes guilty of conduct justifying his removal. Upon the filing of charges,
the Clerk of the Civil Service Commission shall notify its members and serve a
copy of the charges upon the accused Police or Fire Department member with a
statement of the date, place, and hour at which the hearing of charges will
begin, this hearing not to be held within three days of the date of the service
of charges upon the accused member. The day on which the charges are served on
the accused member shall count as one of the days of notice. The person accused
may in writing waive the service of charges and demand trial within three days
after they have been filed with the Clerk of the Civil Service Commission.
   (C)   Upon the hearing, the charges shall be considered traversed and put in
issue, and the trial shall be limited to the issues presented by the written
charges.
   (D)   The Civil Service Commission shall have the power to summon and compel
attendance of witnesses at all hearings by subpoena issued by the Clerk of that
body and served upon the witnesses by members of the Police Department or any
officer authorized to serve subpoenas. If any witness fails to appear in
response to a summons or refuses to testify concerning any matter on which he
may lawfully be interrogated, any district court judge, on application of the
Commission, may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of
disobedience of a subpoena issued from the district court. The accused Police
or Fire Department member shall have the right to have subpoenaed any witnesses
he may desire, upon furnishing their names to the Clerk. As many as ten
subpoenas may be served at the request of the accused member without charge,
but each additional subpoena requested by him shall be issued by the Clerk of
the Civil Service Commission, and served by the Police Department only upon
payment of $.50 to the City Clerk/Tax Assessor by the employee. The action and
decision of the Civil Service Commission on the charges shall be reduced to
writing and kept in a book for that purpose and the written charge shall be
attached to the book containing the body’s decision.
   (E)   In cases where the head of the Police or Fire Department or the Mayor
has probable cause to believe a Police or Fire Department member has been
guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, he shall immediately
suspend that member from duty or from both pay and duty pending trial and the
member shall not be placed on duty or allowed pay thereafter until the charges
are heard by the Civil Service Commission.
   (F)   The Civil Service Commission shall punish any Police or Fire
Department member found guilty by reprimand or suspension for any length of
time not to exceed six months, or by reducing the grade, if the member’s
classification warrants, or by combining any two or more of these punishments,
or by dismissal. No such member shall be reprimanded, removed, suspended, or
dismissed except as provided in this section.
   (G)   In any instance in which the requirements of KRS 15.520 are applicable
to a disciplinary action against a city police officer, such disciplinary
action shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures and requirements of
KRS 15.520.

   (A)   Any member of the Police or Fire Department found guilty by the Civil
Service Commission of any charge as provided by §
35.40 may bring an action in the circuit court of Jefferson County to contest
the action of that body.
   (B)   Upon request in writing by the accused, and the payment of costs
therefor, the Clerk of the Civil Service Commission shall file a certified copy
of the charges and the judgment of that body in the circuit court. Upon the
transcript being filed the case shall be docketed in the circuit court and
tried as an original action.
   (C)   If the Clerk fails to certify the transcript to the circuit court
within five days after the request is made, then the aggrieved person may file
an affidavit in that court setting out as fully as possible the charges made at
the time of trial and judgment, together with a statement that demand for the
transcript had been made of the Clerk more than five days prior to the filing

§ 35.42 NUMBER OF POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT MEMBERS.
   (A)   The City Council shall fix by ordinance the number and classification
of Police and Fire Department members, and the salaries for each
classification. When the number of members and their classification has been
fixed by ordinance, no such member shall be dismissed, suspended, or reduced in
grade or pay for any reason except that set out in §
35.40.
   (B)   Whenever in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, it shall be the
judgment of the City Council that economic necessity requires it, or that there
is no longer a need for a particular position to exist, the Civil Service
Commission may abolish the position and any Police or Fire Department member
occupying the position may be laid off or suspended until and if that position
is re-created or re-established. The abolition of any position must not be a
subterfuge to effect another purpose, but must be actual and bona fide and must
not amount to the mere alteration, modification, or abolition of title only.
   (C)   Should any Police or Fire Department member conceive that he has been
aggrieved by the abolition or the proposed abolition of the position, he may,
at any time within 90 days, file a petition in equity in the circuit court of
Jefferson County stating his reason why the position has not been fairly
abolished, or why it should not be abolished, and upon issue joined thereon by
the city, the burden shall be on the latter to establish the necessity for and
the good faith of the city in abolishing the position. The right to abolish and
the right to have the position re-created shall be determined as other
equitable actions are determined.
   (D)   If the position is re-created or re-established within five years,
then any person who was deprived of his position shall be restored to the
position he formerly held or occupied in the order of his seniority if he shall
elect to do so, and the city shall advise that person at his last known address
and advertise pursuant to KRS Chapter 424, that the position has been re-
created or re-established.

PENSION AND WELFARE FUND
§ 35.55 ESTABLISHMENT; MINIMUM COVERAGE.
   (A)   There is hereby established in conjunction with §§
35.35 through
35.43, a Pension and Welfare Plan to cover all members of the Police and Fire
Departments.
   (B)   This Plan shall be established by the City Council by contracting with
private insurance companies to furnish the necessary pension and welfare funds
provided for, by, and through KRS 90.400, which has been adopted by reference
in §
35.35(A). The minimum coverage of the Pension and Welfare Fund shall be as set
forth in this section.
   (C)   Employee retirement plan.
      (1)   General objective. The general objective of this Plan is to produce
a total retirement income, including primary Social Security, of about 45% to
50% of average pay after 30 years of membership in the Plan. The percentage
will vary, of course, with the individual employee’s years of membership and
earnings. Police and fire fighters become eligible for the Plan on the first
day of any month on which they complete one year of service and attain the age
of 21.
      (2)   Normal retirement date. The normal retirement date shall be the
first of the month (or coincident with) the employee’s 62nd birthday.
      (3)   Retirement annuity.
         (a)   For each year of future service, the retirement annuity shall be
approximately 1/2% of the first $4800 of each year’s annual earnings plus 1-1/
2% of the excess, bought by the contract holder and the employees jointly.
         (b)   For each year of past service, the retirement annuity shall be
1/2% of the first $4800 of annual earnings on the effective date of the Plan,
plus 1% of the excess, bought by the contract holder.
      (4)   Employee contributions. Employees shall contribute 3% per annum of
salary toward defraying expenses of the program.
      (5)   Termination of employment. An employee has the choice of having the
annuity begin at the normal retirement date as purchased by his own
contributions, or to a refund of those contributions.
      (6)   Vested status. If an employee leaves his contribu-tion in the Plan
on termination of his employment, his annuity will include:
         (a)   The future service annuity purchased by the contract-holder for
him to the date of termination, provided he has either contributed for five
years, or reached the age of 55 years at the date of termination, and
         (b)   The past service annuity purchased for him to the date of
termination provided he has reached age 55 at the date of termination. If the
past service annuity has not been purchased for an employee who terminates
employment after he has reached age 55, the annuity will have to be purchased
for him in regular order prior to his normal retirement date.
      (7)   Death of employee. The beneficiary receives a refund of the
employee’s total contributions. If a police officer or firefighter was retired,
the death benefit is reduced by the total of annuity payments already made.
   (D)   Future service schedule. The future service schedule shall be
comprised of a benefit of approximately 1/2% of the first $4800 of annual
earnings, plus l-l/2% of the excess by earnings classes in accordance with the
following schedule:
For Each Year
   In Earnings Class   Unit of Monthly   Police or Fire-
   From Effective Date   Annuity Purchased   fighter Monthly
of This Subchapter   Will Be   Contribution
   Under $2,820 $l.10   3%
2820 - 3179.99   1.25   3%
3180 - 3539.99   1.40   3%
3540 - 3899.99   1.55   3%
3900 - 4259.99   1.70   3%
4260 - 4619.99   1.85   3%
4620 - 4979.99   2.00   3%
4980 - 5339.99   2.45   3%
5340 - 5699.99   2.90   3%
5700 -6059.99    3.35   3%
   Etc. by $360 steps Etc. by $ .45 steps Etc. by $1.35 steps
   (E)   For instance, that person earning $4800 a year will contribute $12 a
month and will have purchased for him an annuity of $2 a month for each year of
membership in that class. If he should remain in that class for 30 years, his
total monthly future service annuity would be 30 times 2 a month, or 60 a month
(720 a year) in addition to his Social Security. If a police officer’s or
firefighter’s earnings class increases, his annuity will, of course, be
greater.
   (E)   In addition to the foregoing coverage provided as minimum coverage,
each police officer and firefighter shall apply any and all funds donated to
him toward purchasing extra and additional coverage hereunder.
   (F)   The city shall provide a plan of Group Life and Accidental Death and
Dismemberment Insurance of $5000 for each member of the Police and Fire
Department with one year of service or more, and shall pay the cost.

involuntarily.
(Ord. 6-1967, passed - - 67)
§ 35.58 SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   In addition to the foregoing benefits, all police officers and
firefighters are granted 15 days of sick leave per year which may be
accumulated from year to year but which shall not exceed 45 days. However, the
Council at its discretion may require a doctor’s certificate to support any and
all claims. The Council shall, after a person has been on sick leave for a long
time (as long as three days) require a doctor’s certificate in any event.
   (B)   On termination either voluntarily or involuntarily of a police officer
or firefighter, that police officer or firefighter shall be entitled to a sum
of money equal to one-third of any accumulated sick leave, the sum to be based
on the proportionate amount that the one-third of the accumulated time would
bear to his monthly or weekly salary.
(Ord. 6-1967, passed - - 67)
§ 35.59 LEGAL COUNSEL.
   It shall be the duty of the city’s Legal Counsel to give advice to any
police officers or firefighters relative to all matters pertaining to their
benefits and obligations under the Pension and Welfare Plan. The city’s Legal
Counsel shall further defend any police officers or firefighters in any action
brought against them (unless said action is instituted by the city) under the
Plan or bring any and all actions which he deems necessary and proper on their
behalf under the Plan.

      (1)   All unexpended monies appropriated to the Pension Fund out of the
city’s General Fund to the Pension and Welfare Fund by City Council at the time
of adoption of the repeal ordinance, shall revert back to the city’s General
Fund. All other unexpended monies or property which has come into the Pension
and Welfare Fund shall be liquidated by the Board of Trustees.
      (2)   Any and all other cash surrender benefits which have resulted from
the contribution of all police officers and firefighters, including any and all

hearing must be requested. Notice shall be mailed to the owner by certified

      (2)   The owner or other party in interest of any abandoned urban
property, as determined pursuant to City of Shively ordinances pertaining to
abandoned urban property taxes, who believes that the property has been
incorrectly classified, may appeal such classification to the Vacant Property
Review Commission. Appeal to the Vacant Property Review Commission may only be
made on the basis that the property was incorrectly classified as abandoned
urban property in that it did not meet the criteria established in City of
Shively ordinances pertaining to abandoned urban property taxes as of January 1
of that tax year. Such appeal shall be in writing and must be received by the
Vacant Property Review Commission within thirty (30) days of the date the
notice was mailed.

designated agent pursuant to subsection (1), above, he or she shall notify the
Vacant Property Review Commission in writing, within twenty (20) days of the
date of the notice from the Vacant Property Review Commission. The request must
state the name, address and phone number of the property owner, the address of

Commission shall set a time and place for hearing and shall give the appellant
written notice thereof. The hearing shall be commenced within thirty (30) days
after a request has been filed. At such hearing, the appellant shall be given
an opportunity to be heard and to show cause why the notice appealed from
should be modified or withdrawn. The failure of the appellant or a legal
representative to appear and participate in the hearing shall have the same
effect as if no request was filed.
      (2)   The Vacant Property Review Commission shall regulate the course of
the proceedings in a manner which will promote the orderly and prompt conduct
of the hearing.
      (3)   To the extent necessary for the full disclosure of all relevant
facts and issues, the Vacant Property Review Commission shall afford all
parties the opportunity to respond, present documentary or tangible evidence,
conduct cross-examination, and submit rebuttal evidence.
      (4)   Any party to a hearing may participate in person or may be
represented by counsel.
      (5)   If a party fails to attend or participate in a hearing, the Vacant
Property Review Commission may adjourn the proceedings and issue a default
order upholding the notice.
      (6)   All testimony shall be made under oath or affirmation. Formal rules
of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and
shall govern the proceedings. All testimony shall be accurately and completely
recorded. Any person, upon request, may receive a copy of the recording,
provided, however, that the party making the request shall be responsible for
the cost of any transcript or copy.
      (7)   Any part of the evidence may be received in written form if doing
so will expedite the hearing without substantial prejudice to the interests of
any party, or if such practice is authorized by statute. Any party shall have
the right, upon reasonable request, to inspect the documentary or tangible
evidence relating to a hearing, either in person or through counsel. Copies of
documentary evidence may be obtained by parties upon the payment of a fee,
except where disclosure is protected by state or federal law.
      (8)   Objections to evidentiary offers may be made by any party and shall
be noted in the record.
      (9)   The Vacant Property Review Commission may take official notice of
any matter of which a court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky may take such
notice.
      (10)   After a hearing, the Vacant Property Review Commission may
sustain, modify, or withdraw the notice appealed from by a majority vote, and
the appellant shall be notified in writing by certified mail of such action.
   (J)   Eminent domain proceedings.
      (1)   The Shively City Council may institute eminent domain proceedings
pursuant to KRS Chapter 416 against any property which has been certified as
blighted and/or deteriorated by the Vacant Property Review Commission pursuant
to this section, provided that, in addition, the Shively City Council finds:
         (a)   That such property has deteriorated to such an extent as to
constitute a serious and growing menace to the public health, safety and
welfare;
         (b)   That such property is likely to continue to deteriorate unless
corrected;
         (c)   That the continued deterioration of such property may contribute
to the blighting or deterioration of the area immediately surrounding the
property; and
         (d)   That the owner of such property has failed to correct the
deterioration of the property.
      (2)   The City of Shively may acquire by eminent domain pursuant to KRS
Chapter 416, any property determined to be blighted or deteriorated pursuant to
this section, and shall have the power to hold, clear, manage, develop or
dispose of the property so acquired, for residential and related uses pursuant
to the provisions of this section and KRS Chapter 99.
   (K)   Acquisition by employees prohibited; disclosure required.
      (1)   Pursuant to KRS 99.730, no member of the Vacant Property Review
Commission or officer or employee of the City of Shively who in the course of
his or her duties is required in any way to participate in the determination of
property blight or deterioration or the issuance of notices of code violations
which might lead to a determination of blight or deterioration, shall acquire
any interest in any property which has been declared to be blighted or
deteriorated by the Vacant Property Review Commission.
      (2)   If any such member, officer or employee owns or has a financial
interest, direct or indirect, in any property at the time it is certified to be
blighted or deteriorated by the Vacant Property Review Commission, he or she
shall immediately disclose, in writing, such interest to the Vacant Property
Review Commission and to the Shively City Council and such disclosure shall be
entered in the minutes of the Vacant Property Review Commission and Shively
City Council. Failure to so disclose such interest shall constitute misconduct.
No payment shall be made to any member, officer or employee for any property or
interest therein acquired by the City of Shively from such member, officer or
employee unless the amount of such payment is fixed by court order in eminent
domain proceedings or unless payment is unanimously approved by the Shively
City Council.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 38.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “City of Shively Code of
Ethics.”
(Ord. 6-2022, passed 11-7-22)
§ 38.02 FINDINGS.
   The city finds and declares that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends upon
the public's confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer and employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards with which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply in
conducting their public duties.
(Ord. 6-2022, passed 11-7-22)
§ 38.03 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
that may arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS 65.003 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

part, any contract made, entered into, awarded or granted by the city or a city

to contracts entered into before an elected officer filed as a candidate for

if any contract entered into by a city or city agency officer or employee
before he or she became a candidate, was appointed to office, or was hired as
an employee, is renewable after he or she becomes a candidate, assumes the

unless the requirements set forth in subpart (3) below are satisfied.
      (2)   The prohibition in subsection (A) of this section shall not apply
if the contract is awarded after public notice and competitive bidding, unless
the officer or employee is authorized to participate in establishing the
contract specifications, awarding the contract, or managing contract
performance after the contract is awarded. If the officer or employee has any
of the authorities set forth in the preceding sentence, then the officer or
employee shall have no interest in the contract, unless the requirements set

governing body of the city or city agency before the contract is executed.
         (c)   A finding is made by the governing body of the city or city
agency that the contract with the officer or employee is in the best interests
of the public and the city or city agency before the contract is executed, and
because of, among other things, price, limited supply, or other specific
reasons.

regulations of the city.
(Ord. 18-1994, passed 11-21-94; Am. Ord. 6-2022, passed 11-7-22)
§ 38.12 INCOMPATIBLE OFFICES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 165 of the Kentucky Constitution, no officer or
employee of the city may also be a state officer, deputy state officer, or
member of the General Assembly, or may fill more than one (1) municipal office
at the same time, whether in the same or a different city.
   (B)   Pursuant to KRS 61.080, no city officer may also hold a county office.
In addition, the statute also states that the following city and consolidated
local government offices are incompatible with any other public office:
      (1)   Member of a legislative body of cities of the first class;
      (2)   Mayor and member of the legislative council of a consolidated local
government; and
      (3)   Mayor and member of the legislative body in cities of the home rule
class.
   (C)   In addition to the constitutional and statutory provisions, there are
common law incompatibilities defined by the courts. City officers and
employment positions are deemed incompatible when one office or position of
employment is inherently inconsistent in function with the other. This
incompatibility occurs when there arises an implication that the duties and
responsibilities of both cannot be performed at the same time with a necessary
degree of impartiality and honesty.
   (D)   KRS 61.090 provides that the acceptance of an incompatible office
operates to vacate the first office.

§ 38.13 WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   An officer or employee must refrain from acting on, or discussing,
formally or informally, a matter before the city, if acting on the matter, or
failing to act on the matter, may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed is §
38.10(C) above. Such an officer or employee should leave the room if it is a
public meeting conducted under KRS 61.810 and KRS 61.815.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
record, of the reason for withdrawal.
   (C)   Ongoing conflict. An officer or employee whose outside employment, or
other outside activity or relationship, can reasonably be expected to require
more than sporadic withdrawal, must resign or cease such outside employment or
activity. An officer or employee should not begin employment or an activity or
relationship that can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic
withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation, they
should not accept the position with the city.
Ord. 6-2022, passed 11-7-22)
§ 38.14 RECEIPT OF GIFTS.
   (A)   No officer or employee of the city or any city agency shall directly,
or indirectly through any other person or business, solicit or accept any gift
having a fair market value of more than one hundred dollars ($100), whether in
the form of money, service, loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing or
promise, or any other form under circumstances in which it could reasonably be
inferred that the gift was intended to influence, or could reasonably be
expected to influence the officer or employee in the performance of his or her
public duties.
   (B)   Certain items are typically excluded from this provision. Examples of
these items include:
      (1)   Gifts received from a family member.
      (2)   Gifts accepted on behalf of the city and transferred to the city.
      (3)   Reasonable travel and travel-related expenses, cost of admission,

      (5)   Awards, including certificates, plaques, and commemorative tokens

§ 38.15 USE OF CITY PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL.
   No officer or employee of the city shall use or permit the use of any city
time, funds, personnel, equipment or other personal or real property for the
private use of any person, unless:
   (A)   The use is specifically authorized by a stated policy.
   (B)   The use is available to the general public, and then only to the
extent and upon the terms that it is available to the general public.
(Ord. 18-1994, passed 11-21-94; Am. Ord. 6-2022, passed 11-7-22)
§ 38.16 REPRESENTATION OF INTERESTS BEFORE CITY GOVERNMENT.
   (A)   No officer or employee of the city or any city agency shall represent
any person, group or business, other than the city, in connection with any
cause, proceeding, application or other matter pending before the city or any
city agency.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit an employee from representing
another employee or employees where the representation is within the context of
official labor union or similar representational responsibilities.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any officer or employee from
representing himself or herself in matters concerning his or her own interest.
   (D)   No elected officer shall be prohibited by this section from making any
inquiry for information on behalf of a constituent, if no compensation, reward
or other thing of value is promised to, given to, or accepted by the officer,
whether directly or indirectly, in return for the inquiry.
(Ord. 18-1994, passed 11-21-94; Am. Ord. 6-2022, passed 11-7-22)
§ 38.17 MISUSE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

§ 38.27 SOCIAL MEDIA.
   (A)   City officials, including members of city agencies, boards and
commissions, can maintain a personal presence on social media. However, to be
considered personal, there can be no mention of their status as a city
official. Any mention of their status as a city official potentially changes
the nature of the page to one for a public agency, requiring record keeping in
accordance with the Kentucky Department of Library and Archives retention
schedule and subjecting the entire page to open records requests.
   (B)   Elected officials who want to interact with the community on social
media in their role as a city official are required to maintain a separate
social media account from their personal account if they have one. City
officials will notify the City Clerk of any official page(s) utilized. The City
Clerk will maintain an updated list of official pages of city officials.
   (C)   City officials shall conduct themselves professionally and as
representatives of the city.
   (D)   Elected city official pages shall clearly indicate that any content
posted, or submitted for posting, is subject to public disclosure.
Additionally, guidelines, if any, shall be posted conspicuously on the page.
   (E)   No comments shall be deleted unless in violation of posted guidelines.
Deleted comments shall be provided to the City Clerk and must be saved for one
(1) year.

media sites. If receiving a specific request from a citizen, the city official
shall state words to the effect of: “Thank you for your question. Please email
me at (official email address) or contact me at (phone number). I look forward
to speaking with you.”
   (G)   Elected officials shall not discuss issues pending before the City
Council. Elected officials may seek public input but shall not respond to
comments. Engaging in substantive conversations on social media could require
retention of the posts and may violate the Open Meetings Act if other elected
officials are also engaging in the discussion.
   (H)   City employees shall be bound by any and all social media policies
promulgated by the city.
(Ord. 6-2022, passed 11-7-22)

   (C)   City officials shall retain emails according to the Kentucky
Department of Library and Archives schedule for emails. City officials shall

required to file such a statement has failed to file it, has a deficient
statement, or has filed a statement that reveals a possible or potential
violation of this code. If the Board of Ethics determines that an annual, or
transactional, disclosure statement is deficient, or reveals a possible or
potential violation of this code, the Board will notify the person in writing
of the deficiency, or possible or potential violation, and of the penalties for
failure to comply with this code.

§ 38.66 FILING AND INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   All complaints alleging any violation of the provisions of this
chapter shall be submitted to the Board of Ethics or to the administrative
official designated by the Board of Ethics. All complaints shall be in writing,
signed by the complainant, and shall meet any other requirements established by
the Board of Ethics. The Board of Ethics shall acknowledge receipt of a
complaint to the complainant within ten (10) working days from the date of
receipt. The Board shall forward, within ten (10) working days, to each
individual who is the subject of the complaint, a copy of the complaint and a
general statement of the applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Board of Ethics may, on its own initiative, determine through an
inquiry into informal allegations, or information provided directly to the
Board, by referral, by coverage in the public news media, or otherwise that a
violation of this code may exist and prepare a complaint of its own. The Board
of Ethics may also amend a complaint that has been filed with it by adding
further allegations, by adding respondents involved in the same conduct,
directly or indirectly and by action or inaction, or by deleting allegations
that have been made against persons or entities not covered by this code, or by
deleting allegations that do not appear to be supported by the facts. The Board
of Ethics may also consolidate complaints where the allegations are materially
related. Amended complaints must be sent to the complainant and respondent by
the Board of Ethics.
   (C)   Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a proper complaint, the
Board of Ethics shall conduct a preliminary inquiry concerning the allegations
contained in the complaint. If a complaint is accepted pursuant to subsection
(A), the Board of Ethics must conduct an investigation and, from this point on,
the complainant may not withdraw their complaint, although they may request
that the Board either make a finding of no probable cause or no violation. The
Board shall afford a person who is the subject of the complaint an opportunity
to respond to the allegations in the complaint. The person shall have the right
to be represented by counsel, to appear and be heard under oath, and to offer
evidence in response to the allegations.
   (D)   The person who is the subject of the complaint (respondent) may file
with the Board of Ethics a response, in writing and signed by respondent, to
the complaint within thirty (30) days after their receipt of the complaint. The
response, if any, must be sent to the person filing the original complaint
(complainant) by the Board of Ethics within five (5) days after its filing.
Within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the complainant may also file with the
Board of Ethics a response to the respondent’s response, which the Board of
Ethics must send to the respondent within five (5) days after its filing.
   (E)   Extensions of time to any of the time limitations specified in this
section may be granted by the Board of Ethics upon a vote of the majority of
the members. If no meeting can be held before such time limit runs, the
chairperson may extend the time frame until the following meeting. The Board of
Ethics must give written notice of any extension(s) of time to the respondent
and the complainant.
   (F)   In conducting an investigation, the Board of Ethics may administer
oaths or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require
the production of any books or records it deems relevant and material. The
Police Department and all city agencies, bodies, officials and employees are
required to respond fully and truthfully to all inquiries, and to cooperate
with all requests of the Board or its agents relating to an investigation. It
is a violation of this code for any official or employee to deny access to
information requested by the Board of Ethics in the course of an investigation
or a public hearing, except to the extent that the denial is required by
federal, state or local law.
   (G)   Nothing in this section may be construed to permit the Board of Ethics
to conduct an investigation of itself or any of its members or staff. If the
Board of Ethics receives a complaint alleging that it, or any of its members or
staff, has violated any provisions of this code or any other law, the Board of
Ethics must promptly transmit copy of this complaint to the City Council.
   (H)   All proceedings and records relating to a preliminary inquiry being
conducted by the Board of Ethics shall be confidential until a final
determination is made by the Board, except:
      (1) The Board may turn over to the Commonwealth Attorney or County
Attorney evidence that may be used in criminal proceedings.
      (2)   If the complainant or the respondent publicly discloses the
existence of a preliminary inquiry, the Board may publicly confirm the
existence of the inquiry, and, at its discretion, make public any documents
that were issued to either party.
   (I)   The Board shall make a determination based on its preliminary inquiry
whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction and, if so, whether it alleges
a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation of this chapter. If the Board
concludes that the complaint is outside of its jurisdiction, frivolous or
without factual basis, the Board shall immediately terminate the inquiry,
reduce its conclusion to writing, and transmit a copy of its decision to the
complainant and to all individuals against whom the complaint was filed.
   (J)   If the Board of Ethics concludes, based upon its preliminary inquiry,
that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and contains allegations
sufficient to establish a minimal factual basis to constitute probable cause as
to a violation, the Board shall notify the individual who is the subject of the
complaint, and may:
      (1)   Due to mitigating circumstances such as, lack of significant
economic advantages or gain by the individual, lack of economic loss to the
city and its taxpayers, or lack of significant impact on public confidence in
city government, issue, in writing, a confidential reprimand to the individual
concerning the alleged violation and provide a copy of the confidential
reprimand to the Mayor and City Council.
      (2)   Initiate a hearing to determine whether there has been a violation.
   (K)   Any person who knowingly files with the Board a false complaint
alleging a violation of any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a
Class A misdemeanor.

§ 38.67 NOTICE OF HEARINGS.
   If the Board of Ethics determines that a hearing regarding allegations
contained in the complaint is necessary, the Board shall issue an order setting
the matter for a hearing within thirty (30) days of the date the order is
issued, unless the respondent petitions for and the Board consents to a later

lands and improvements in the city held or owned by every person, firm,
company, association, or corporation in his, her, their or its own right as
fiduciary, guardian or agent, subject to municipal taxation and under the laws
of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including all property and franchises
heretofore or hereafter assessed by the Jefferson County Property Valuation
Administration, and in the case where such action is required by law by the
State Railroad Commission, or the Revenue Cabinet of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky, for taxation by the city. The rate shall be levied per one hundred
dollars ($100.00) of assessed value, but not to include any property exempt by
law from such taxation.
   (B)   Ad valorem tax for each fiscal year is hereby levied by the city on
all personal property in the city held or owned by every person, firm, company,
association or corporation in his, her, their or its own right as fiduciary,
guardian or agent, subject to municipal taxation under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Kentucky, including all property and franchises heretofore or
hereafter assessed by law by the Revenue Cabinet of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky for taxation by the city. The rate shall be levied per one hundred
dollars ($100.00) of assessed value, but not to include any property exempt by
law from such taxation. However, the ad valorem personal property tax as it
applies to motor vehicles and motorboats shall be at the rate authorized by KRS
132.487 and 132.488, respectively, and shall be governed by the provisions of
KRS 134.800 to 134.830.
   (C)   The taxes shall be used for the payment of all general expenses of the
city.
   (D)   The City of Shively does hereby elect to use the Jefferson County
Property Valuation Administration tax assessment of all real estate located in
the city as of January 1, 2023, as the basis for ad valorem taxes for the city
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Taxes are due and payable as soon as
the tax bills come into the hands of the collector in the year assessed, and
the face amount shall be due and payable during September of the year assessed.
Pursuant to KRS 91A.070(2), the City Tax Collector shall cause the tax bills to
be made out and sequentially numbered and mail tax bills from the assessment
rolls as certified by the Jefferson County PVA. In addition, pursuant to KRS
65.8834, any unpaid, properly recorded Shively Code Enforcement liens shall be
included on the city ad valorem tax bill, and the amount of the code
enforcement lien shall be listed and treated as a separate item on the property
tax bill and shall not be considered a part of the ad valorem tax liability.
Any late payment or nonpayment of a code enforcement lien listed pursuant to
this section shall not be enforced under KRS 91A.070 and shall remain
enforceable pursuant to KRS 65.8835. In addition to the enforcement procedures
authorized by KRS 65.8835, the city government may elect to use KRS 91.481 to

manner as authorized for unpaid tax bills. The payment of tax bills and code
enforcement liens may be made directly in person at Shively City Hall, 3920
Dixie Highway, Shively, Kentucky 40216, or payment of tax bills and code
enforcement liens may be made by check or credit card sent to Shively City Hall
at the aforementioned address. From and after October 1, in the year assessed
and thereafter, a penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) per annum of the
face amount of the tax bill shall be imposed plus interest from October 1, in
the year assessed and thereafter at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum,
except that on property assessed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. All
delinquent tax collection expenses incurred by the city, including lien filing
and release fees, attorney's fees and cost of initiating legal action, shall be
deemed a penalty in addition to that penalty specified above and shall be
encompassed within the city's lien. The proceeds of such taxes, penalties and
interest are to be placed in the general fund of the City of Shively and are to
be used for general operating purposes and expenses of the city and all other
necessary and proper municipal functions as may be properly ordained or
resolved by the City Council.

§ 40.03 SPECIAL TAX LEVY.
   (A)   The City Council of the city does hereby levy a special property tax
pursuant to KRS 78.530 (3)(c) to pay, within a period of no more than fifteen
(15) years, for the cost of current service credit purchased in the County
Employees’ Retirement System for eligible employees of the city. The tax shall
be in addition to the existing employer contribution rate as determined by the
consulting actuary authorized in KRS Chapter 78.530 (3)(c) for the period
between July 1, 1958 and the participation date by the city in the County
Employees’ Retirement System. Revenue realized from levy of the tax shall be
employed to pay for current service credit over a period of time not to exceed
fifteen (15) years and for no other purpose. The special tax levied by this
section shall be rescinded when the unfunded prior service liability has been
amortized and it shall not be subject to the provisions of KRS 132.017 or KRS
132.027. The city shall not collect the special property tax if its
participation in CERS has been terminated pursuant to KRS 78.535.
   (B)   The special tax provided for in this section shall be levied against
real estate only. The tax rate for the special tax is hereby fixed at the rate
of ten cents ($.10) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of real property value as
assessed for taxation purposes.
   (C)   The City Tax Collector shall issue bills for the special tax to be
incorporated in the ad valorem tax bills levied each fiscal year by the city

      (1)   If paid when received in the year assessed, face amount of bill;
      (2)   From and after October 1 in year assessed and thereafter, face
amount of bill plus ten percent (10%) penalty, plus interest at the rate of one
percent (1%) per month.
   (D)   Proceeds of this tax shall be paid into the general fund account of
the city. Proceeds of this tax shall not be co-mingled with other revenues and
receipts of the city and shall be retained in a separate account to be used as
set out in subsection (A) above.
(Ord. 5-1989, passed 4-3-89)
§ 40.04 REFUND OF TAXES OTHER THAN AD VALOREM AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAXES.
   (A)   When money has been paid into the city treasury in payment of any city
taxes, except ad valorem taxes, whether payment was made voluntarily or
involuntary, the mayor or chief financial officer shall authorize refunds or
credits to the person who paid the tax, or to his heirs, personal
representatives or assigns, of an overpayment of tax and any payment where no
tax was due.
   (B)   When a bona fide controversy exists between the city and the taxpayer
as to the liability of the taxpayer for the payment of the tax claimed to be
due by the city, the taxpayer may pay the amount claimed by the city to be due
and if an appeal is taken by the taxpayer from the ruling of the city within
thirty (30) days and it is finally adjudged that the taxpayer was not liable
for the payment of the tax or any part thereof, the city shall authorize the
refund or credit as the court may direct.
   (C)   Refunds or credits shall be authorized with interest as provided in
KRS 131.183. Refunds shall not be charged against any appropriation, but shall
be deducted from tax receipts for the current fiscal year.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the agency to
make or cause to be made any refund except within one (1) year of the date
prescribed by law for the filing the return, or the date the money was paid
into the city treasury, whichever is the later, except in any case where the
assessment period has been extended by written agreement between the taxpayer
and the city, the limitation contained in this section shall be extended
accordingly.
   (E)   This section shall not apply in any case in which the ordinance may be
held unconstitutional, in whole or in part. In cases in which the ordinance has
been held unconstitutional, taxes paid hereunder may be refunded to the extent
provided by KRS 134.590, and by the ordinance held unconstitutional.

provide the Division of Revenue and the Property Valuation Administrator with
such changes so that they can be stricken for that tax year. In the event that
an incorrectly classified property is not removed from the list of properties
for that year, the owner may apply for and obtain a refund for any overpayment
of the abandoned urban property tax for that tax year.
      (5)   The Vacant Property Review Commission shall develop policies and
procedures for conducting such appeals consistent with procedures for appeals

City of Shively Code of Ordinances, that at a minimum will provide the owner
with at least ten (10) days' written notice before the scheduling of the

TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES
§ 70.20 SIGNAL LEGENDS.
   Whenever traffic is regulated or controlled exclusively by a traffic-control
sign or signs exhibiting the words “Go,” “Caution,” or “Stop,” or exhibiting
different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “Go”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the green or
“Go” signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or “Stop”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or “Go” is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed
until it can do so without danger.
   (E)   Flashing amber alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall reduce
its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by such
signal.
   (F)   “Yield Right-of-Way”: Vehicular traffic facing the “Yield Right-of-
Way” sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a “Yield Right-of-Way”
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to vehicles
entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from
that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles shall not move
against them. If flashing amber lights show above a lane, that lane shall be
used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at such place prohibits
such turn.

provisions of this traffic code or of a traffic barrier or sign erected by any
of the public departments or public utilities of the city, or any electric
signal, gate, or watchman at railroad crossings, unless otherwise directed by a
police officer. However, the type and the right to or necessity for such
barrier or sign must be approved by the city.
   (B)   Such sign, signal, marking, or barrier shall have the same authority

device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with
the effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or
signal. No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority
permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting any
public department or public utility of the city in any emergency or temporarily
from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been
approved by the city.
   (B)   No electric signal, sign, or other illuminated or other advertising
structure making use of flashing lights or revolving beacons shall be erected

public nuisance and the city is empowered forthwith to remove it or cause it to
be removed.

offense is a misdemeanor committed in his presence and there are reasonable
grounds to believe that the person cited will appear to answer the charge. The
officer shall take the name, address, and operator’s license number of the
alleged violator in writing on a form provided by the city. The citation shall
provide that the defendant shall appear to answer to the charge against him at

and other vehicles upon the highway.
   (B) A person shall not willfully operate any vehicle on any highway in such
a manner as to injure the highway.
   (C)   A person shall not willfully operate any vehicle on any highway in
such a manner as to injure vehicles or equipment located in or near a highway

§ 71.02 OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to operate any vehicle or permit it to remain
standing in any street in such manner as to create an obstruction thereof.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for the operator of any vehicle to enter any
intersection or crosswalk unless there is sufficient space on the other side of
the intersection or crosswalk to accommodate the vehicle without obstructing
the passage of other vehicles or pedestrians, notwithstanding the indication of
any traffic-control signal which may be located at the intersection or
crosswalk.
   (C)   Any intersection deemed by the city to be of special or critical
importance to the movement of traffic shall be marked in such distinctive
manner as to indicate such importance. Should the operator of any vehicle enter
any intersection so marked when there is insufficient room on the other side of
the intersection to accommodate the vehicle, the indication of any traffic-
control signal notwithstanding, he shall be deemed to have violated this
division rather than division (B) above.
(Ord. 1120-1958, passed - - 58) Penalty, see §
71.99
§ 71.03 REVERSE OR U TURNS.

than is reasonable and prudent, having regard for the traffic and for the
condition and use of the highway.
   (B)   Where no condition exists that requires lower speed for compliance
with division (A) of this section, the speed of any vehicle not in excess of
the limit specified in this section or established as hereinafter authorized

greater or less than is reasonable or safe under the conditions found to exist
at any location within the city, the city may determine and authorize by
ordinance or order a reasonable and safe speed limit at such location which
shall be effective at all times or during the hours of daytime or nighttime, or
at such times as may be determined when appropriate signs giving notice thereof

above so as to permit in any instance a speed limit in excess of 55 miles per
hour.
   (D)   No person shall drive a motor vehicle at such a slow speed as to
impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic except when
reduced speed is necessary for safe operation or in compliance with law.
   (E)    In every charge for a violation of any speed limit specified in this
section or established as herein authorized, the warrant or citation shall
specify the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have driven, as well as
the lawful speed limit applicable at the location where the violation is
charged to have occurred.

   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity

factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is in the
United Sates government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease, or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city, and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or

allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this division,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar of fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

city.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its
occupational license tax return with the city. Whenever, in the opinion of the
city, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any business
entity in order to audit the return, the city may compel the business entity to

thereof that have not been previously filed. The city may also require copies

   (C)   In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar reciprocity
agreements as described in division (B) with any other taxing entity, should
there be a need for exchange of information in order to effect diligent
enforcement of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 113.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City Council hereby finds that:
   (A)   Certain adult entertainment activities which are located near areas
zoned for residential use, near schools and public parks, and near malls and
similar open spaces that cater to use by family groups and children adversely
affect the viability of such nearby properties for such purposes;
   (B)   Local governments and the United States Government have spent millions
of dollars on community development and neighborhood enhancement projects over
the past several years to eliminate blight and to prevent the further
deterioration of neighborhoods in this city and county;
   (C)   Adult entertainment activities, because of the conditions of their
operations, have contributed to an increased incidence of crime and juvenile
delinquency, particularly when adult entertainment activities are located in
close proximity to one another;
   (D)   Adult entertainment activities, through outside displays, tend to
attract an undersirable clientele that discourages neighboring residents from
undertaking civic improvements, causes residents and businesses to move
elsewhere, and frustrates attempts to attract new residents and businesses to
come into the area, all of which factors contribute to a diminution of property
values and to a general deterioration of the neighborhoods in this city and
adjacent areas; and that the small closet-like rooms or “booths” at adult
amusement arcades in this city have encouraged persons to loiter for the
purpose of engaging in unlawful, often anonymous, sexual conduct and have
encouraged lewd conduct in public places, thereby creating a public nuisance,
generally unsanitary conditions, and a danger to health and safety;
   (E)   The concentration of sexually explicit movies, books, and sexual
paraphernalia in such establishments in this city, which also house sexually
explicit movies, and hotel rooms rented by the hour to “couples” afforded free
sexually explicit movies in the hotel room have provided prostitutes an
appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and have created public
nuisances in otherwise respectable neighborhoods in this city;
   (F)   Children, the family environment, and residential neighborhoods are
suffering injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences
resulting from the distribution and exposure to certain sexually explicit
matter, this being particularly so when such matter is permitted to leave a
store’s premises and enter the immediate family environment, neighborhood, and
certain areas where children are likely to be;
   (G)   The noise generated by patrons coming and going from adult
entertainment activity establishments causes a substantial disruption to nearby
residents, and a modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is
offered to patrons coming and going from such establishments would afford some
relief to persons living in such nearby residences without significantly
interfering with the availability of the entertainment offered therein; and
   (H)   Nationally, there is extensive involvement of organized crime in the
business of adult book stores and other adult activities and that the
disclosure of the names of persons who own, as well as the names of the persons
who operate, such adult book stores and other adult activity establishments
will aid law enforcement officials in the enforcement of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) as well as in the enforcement
of the laws of this city and state prohibiting the distribution of obscene
matter, the use of minors to distribute obscene matter, the advertising of
obscene material, the distribution of obscene matter to minors, promoting the
sale of obscenity, the use of a minor in a sexual performance, the distribution
of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor, the promoting of
material portraying a sexual performance by a minor, the advertising of
material portraying a sexual performance by a minor, and the use of minors to
distribute material portraying a sexual performance by a minor.
(Ord. 15-1987, passed 10-5-87)
§ 113.02 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC POLICY.
   In order to preserve surrounding neighborhoods, prevent blight and the
deterioration of the neighborhoods of this city, protect property values,
promote the return of residents and businesses to this city’s neighborhoods,
protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to sexually explicit
material, and decrease the incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency, the
licensing and regulation of adult entertainment establishments is a public
necessity and is required in the interest of the public health, safety, and
welfare and the economic and aesthetic well-being of the people.
(Ord. 15-1987, passed 10-5-87)
§ 113.03 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purposes of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect neighborhoods from the noise, the blighting influence,
and the increase in crime brought about by the concentration and harmful
location of adult entertainment establishments;
      (2)   To prevent the unsanitary conditions which exist at “adult
amusement arcades” and to prevent health risks caused by illicit and unlawful
sexual relations in such public establishments;
      (3)   To protect children and the family environment from the deleterious
and harmful effects of exposure to certain sexually explicit matter; and
      (4)   To obtain the identity of persons licensed and to be licensed for
the operation of establishments selling, showing, or renting certain sexually
explicit material in order to identify the persons responsible for operating
such businesses and assist in enforcing this chapter.
   (B)   It is not the purpose of this chapter to establish community standards
on obscenity nor to permit persons to engage in any activity which is in
violation of law, including but not limited to city and state laws pertaining
to the advertising, promotion, distribution, or sale of obscene material or
materials portraying a sexual performance by a minor, or state laws pertaining
to use of a minor in a sexual performance or promotion of a sexual performance
by a minor, or the use of a minor to distribute material portraying a sexual
performance by a minor.

introduction of evidence and shall hear all arguments in regard thereto. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the City Administrator shall issue a written
decision in regard thereto and mail a certified copy thereof to the licensee at
the address of the licensed premises by certified or registered mail.
   (D)   Upon approval from the City ABC Administrator, an emergency suspension
may be ordered when it is reasonably believed that the health, welfare, safety,

licensee. In the instance of the immediate suspension of a license, licensees
are entitled to an expedited hearing within three business days with the ABC
Administrator. The licensee may appeal the decision of the ABC Administrator to
the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control within ten business days
of the order. An emergency suspension order will remain in effect until a final
order is entered. A licensee may remain open during a suspension provided that
alcohol is not being served and any alcohol inventory is secured.
   (E)   Emergency situations which support a finding that continued operation
of the license holder pending a hearing would constitute a threat to the public
health, welfare, safety, and/or security of the community sufficient for
emergency action are:
      (1)   Violations of the alcoholic beverage control laws that directly led
to or contributed to the death or serious physical injury of a person,
regardless if the death or serious physical injury occurred on the licensed
premises;
      (2)   Violations of KRS 244.080(1) in which five or more different minors
were sold or served alcohol by the licensee within a 24 hour time period;
      (3)   Violation of KRS 244.125 wherein a firearm was discharged on the
licensed premises;
      (4)   Excessive complaints against a licensee requiring local law
enforcement to expend an inordinate amount of resources in a six month period;
      (5)   Any other manmade or natural event which causes a reasonable person
to believe the continued operation of the licensed premises would pose a
serious threat to the public health, welfare, safety and/or security of the
community.

      (3)   Collocation on any other existing pole or an existing structure in
the public rights-of-way;
      (4)   Location on a new pole of any kind.
   (B)   The city may propose an alternative location for proposed facilities
from the proposed location.
      (1)   The city shall provide the applicant with a written explanation of
the reason it believes the alternate location is preferable.
      (2)   The applicant shall then:
         (a)   Accept the city's recommendation;
         (b)   Identify another alternate location and provide a written
explanation why it is preferable; or
         (c)   Provide a written explanation why is continues to believe the
original location remains the best alternative.
      (3)   The facilities operator shall utilize the alternate location,
unless the facilities operator shows that the alternate location is not
feasible.

(Ord. 2-2021, passed 3-15-21)
§ 126.05 STANDARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   State or federal requirements. Small cell wireless facilities,
including ancillary equipment, must meet or exceed current standards and
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), all applicable
federal, state and local health and safety regulations, including the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.), and all other
agencies of the state or federal government with the regulatory authority over
small cell wireless facilities. Federal law prohibits the city from denying a
permit if doing so would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services. If, at any time, the state or federal
standards are modified, then the applicant shall bring any and all permitted
facilities into compliance with current standards and regulations within three
(3) months of the effective date of such modified standards and regulations,
unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or
federal agency. Failure to bring permitted facilities into compliance with such
revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the revocation
of the city permit and require the removal of the small cell facility at the
service provider’s expense.
   (B)   Building codes and safety standards. The applicant shall ensure the
structural integrity of its small cell wireless facilities installed within the
city, and shall ensure that they are maintained in compliance with standards
contained in applicable state or local building codes, the Louisville Metro
Land Development Code and the applicable standards for small cell wireless
facilities published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from
time to time. If, upon inspection, the city determines that a facility fails to
comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then, upon notice being provided to the applicant of the facility,
the applicant shall have fifteen (15) days to bring it into compliance with
such standards. Failure to bring the facility into compliance within the
required time shall constitute grounds for the revocation of the city permit
and the removal of the small cell facility at the owner’s expense.
   (C)   Radio frequency emissions standards. Applicants shall confirm that the
projected radio frequency emissions from any and all permitted small cell
wireless facilities comply with the applicable safety standard specified in 47
C.F.R. 1.1307(b). Such information shall be submitted with the permit
application materials and annually thereafter if requested by the city.
   (D)   Operation and maintenance standards. In addition to any other
conditions required by permits issued pursuant to this chapter, all small cell
wifeless facilities shall always comply with the following standards.
      (1)   Except as provided in this chapter, an applicant shall not install
signs, display logos, or run advertisements on, alongside, or in connection
with a permitted facility.
      (2)   Every permitted facility shall contain signage listing the name and
contact information for an emergency contact individual or service. The signage
shall comply with design, material, color and location requirements as stated
in the applicable encroachment permit. Contact information listed on the sign
shall be kept current and shall be promptly provided to the city.
      (3)   Each permitted facility and any ancillary equipment shall be
maintained in good working condition and appearance, free from trash, debris,
litter, graffiti and other forms of vandalism. Any damage from any cause shall
be repaired as soon as reasonably possible to minimize occurrences of dangerous
conditions or visual blight. Graffiti shall be removed from any facility or
equipment as soon as practicable, and in no instance more than forty-eight (48)
hours from the time of receipt of city notice.
      (4)   Except for emergency repairs, testing and maintenance activities
shall only occur between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Monday through
Friday, excluding holidays.
      (5)   Each facility shall install the following security measures:
         (a)   An on-site emergency “kill switch” to de-energize all radio
frequency circuits and components of each permitted facility in order to
protect emergency response personnel;
         (b)   Necessary safety measures to prevent unauthorized access,
vandalism and other safety concerns. Installations must comply with design
standards, described herein, and nuisance regulations, and must not interfere
with city emergency services or transmission.
      (6)   Except for public improvement projects undertaken primarily for
beautification, each facility shall be relocated at the applicant's sole cost,
upon demand by the city with reasonable notice, to allow for public improvement
projects necessary for the public’s health and safety.
      (7)   The applicant shall, at its sole cost, be responsible for repairing
to city standard specifications or replacing in kind any city facilities or
improvements disturbed or damaged during the installation, maintenance,
operation, repair or removal of the applicant's small cell wireless facilities,
ancillary equipment, and any support infrastructure. City facilities or
improvements covered by this subsection include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         (a)   Curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm drains and pavements;
         (b)   Landscaping; and
         (c)   Structures, buildings, light poles and fixtures.

facilities shall comply with the following requirements.
      (1)   All electrical power required by small cell wireless facility
installations shall be metered independently from any anticipated or existing
city projects or facilities.
      (2)   All existing, city-owned street light poles proposed for small cell
wireless facility installations shall be inspected prior to installation in
accordance with the most recent city structural standards for street light
poles, including, but not limited to, safety and load-bearing capability for
the small cell wireless facility to be installed, as approved by the City
Engineer.
         (a)   Applicants requesting the installation of a small cell wireless
facility on a city-owned streetlight pole shall provide documentation
demonstrating that the pole proposed for installation meets or exceeds such
city standards.
         (b)   If the city-owned streetlight pole proposed for the installation
of a small cell wireless facility does not meet or exceed structural standards,
no small cell wireless facility may be installed thereon. Alternatively, the
applicant may, at its own cost, replace the existing streetlight pole at the
proposed installation location with a pole that meets or exceeds the city’s
structural standards, including safety and load-bearing capability or capacity,
and complies with all other applicable legal requirements. Any existing
lighting fixture shall be reinstalled on the new pole at the applicant’s cost.
The applicant shall be responsible for coordinating electrification of the new
installation with the utility provider, including independent metering of
electrical power required for the applicant’s installations as provided herein.
Upon installation, the new pole shall become the property of the city.
   (F)   Small cell wireless facilities and any ancillary equipment shall be
located and designed to be decorative facilities, and blend with the existing
natural or built surroundings, provided, however, the obligation to install
decorative facilities in the rights-of-way shall be applied uniformly and
nondiscriminatory, and shall be no more burdensome than the requirements
applied to similar types of infrastructure deployments for other similarly-
situated utility installations. The applicant cannot remove or damage any city
landscaping and may be required by the city to install buffering landscaping.
   (G)   Ancillary equipment.
      (1)   Ancillary equipment and any support facilities for small cell
wireless facilities located in the public rights-of-way shall be installed in
accordance with the following preferences, ordered from the most preferred to

         (b)   On the pole or support structure; or
         (c)   Integrated into the base of the pole or support structure.
      (2)   Applications that involve less-preferred installation locations may
be approved so long as the applicant demonstrates that the more-preferred
installation location would be technically infeasible.
      (3)   Any claim of infeasibility shall be supported by substantial
evidence.
      (4)   If undergrounding of ancillary equipment is not possible, all such
equipment shall be located within a decorative facility, and shall comply with
all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
   (H)   Pole designs. Subject to subsection (F) of this section, small cell
wireless facility pole installations shall be a decorative facility. Each
installation shall be sufficiently designed and engineered such that no
additional supporting hardware is required beyond the pole itself. A small cell
wireless facility affixed to an existing light pole shall be painted and/or
textured to match that structure.
   (I)   Nonreflective materials. Small cell wireless facilities shall be
constructed out of nonreflective materials (visible exterior surfaces only), or
materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. Anodized metal
is an acceptable treatment.
   (J)   Design preservation. Applicants are responsible for maintaining and
preserving design and aesthetic features for each facility, ancillary equipment
and any support infrastructure, including, but not limited to, color, tint,
shade, treatment, painting, surface treatment, replacement landscaping,
decorative facility design, and concealment.
   (K)   Security fencing. Under no circumstances shall security fencing be
permitted.
   (L)   Volume. Each individual antenna may not exceed three (3) cubic feet in
