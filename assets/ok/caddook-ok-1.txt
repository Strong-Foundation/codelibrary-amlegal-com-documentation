There is hereby levied and there shall be paid by every person storing, using

5-4-7: Reporting To State
5-4-8: Nonretaliation
5-4-1: FINDINGS AND INTENT:
The town board of trustees finds that youth addiction to tobacco products is a
public health problem with grave health consequences. In recognition that
almost ninety percent (90%) of all smokers begin smoking by the age of eighteen
(18), action is needed to curtail the easy access of minors to cigarettes and
other addictive tobacco products. Furthermore, the town board of trustees finds
that the Oklahoma state legislature has limited the powers granted to local
governments to address the problems of youth access to tobacco. Therefore, the
intent of this chapter is to:
   A.   Implement the strictest and most enforceable system allowed under
Oklahoma state law to prevent the illegal sale of cigarettes and other tobacco
products to minors;
   B.   Periodically amend and update this chapter as necessary to best utilize
any applicable powers which may be returned to Oklahoma municipalities in the
future; and
   C.   Educate, encourage and assist underage tobacco users in ceasing all use
of addictive tobacco products, preferably before daily use of such products is
initiated.

to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic

crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
         c.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as
provided in 47 Oklahoma Statutes section 11-203, pedestrians facing any green
signal except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across

insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown, and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
      3.   Steady Red Indication:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall
stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to
proceed is shown except as provided in subsection A3b of this section.
         b.   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular
traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to
turn right or to turn left from a one way street into a one way street after
stopping as required by subsection A3a of this section. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
         c.   In order to prohibit right turns or left turns as prescribed in
subsection A3b of this section on the red signal after the required stop, the
town must erect clear, concise signs informing drivers that such turns are
prohibited.

with rapid intermitted flashes, drivers of vehicles my proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   B.   Exemptions: This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings.

the intersection from the other street or which are approaching so closely
thereon as to constitute an immediate hazard. (1999 Code § 7-904)
   D.   Vehicles Entering Yield Intersection: The driver of a vehicle
approaching a yield sign shall slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing

caution, the one required to take caution shall have the right of way. In any
event, a vehicle which already has entered the intersection shall have the
right of way over one which has not so entered the intersection. (1999 Code §

vehicle upon a street at a speed greater than will permit him to bring it to a
stop within the assured clear distance ahead.

requires lower speed for compliance with subsection A of this section, the
limits specified in subsections B1 and B2 of this section, until changed by the

indicate the beginning and end of such zones. When such signs or markings are
in place and clearly visible, every driver of a vehicle shall obey the
directions thereof.

planning documents to the town council, as herein required.
         b.   Secondary Access. An alley shall serve only as a secondary means
of access to a property. No building/dwelling shall be permitted or the
occupancy of a structure, located on an alley unless access is also available

abutting a public street shall be deemed to have legal access to such street,
unless specifically prohibited by platted limits of no access. The alley
providing access shall be open and accessible from the property.
   C.   Required Distance Between Buildings:
      1.   Required Distance Between Main Buildings. No main building two
stories or less in height shall be closer than ten feet to any other main

      1.   Front Yard Regulations:
         a.   Through Lots.
            (1)   Where both front and rear yards abut a street, the minimum
front yard requirement of the town ordinance shall apply to any frontage that
has access to a street. The frontage which has no access permitted shall be
subject to the rear yard requirements of the town ordinances.
            (2)   Accessory uses shall also be permitted in the rear and side
yards of lots designed with double frontage, but only in accordance with the
provisions of Paragraph (1) above, provided they do not obstruct the view of
traffic from an intersecting street.
      2.   Side Yard Regulations. If a continuous row of lots is to be
developed by the construction of a series of dwellings not more than thirty-
five (35) feet in height, a side yard of two and one-half feet may be permitted
on one side of the building where a driveway is to be constructed on the other
side, provided that open space of not less than ten feet is maintained between
all such dwellings.
      3.   Rear Yard Regulations. Regardless of any other building setback
requirements, except as provided for accessory buildings, structures, there
shall be a ten-foot area at the rear of all lots where no structure shall be
permitted in order to provide for utilities, provided that this restriction
shall not apply where there is an existing alley.
      4.   General Yard Regulations.
         a.   Yard Requirements for Open Land. If a lot is occupied by a
permitted use without structures, such as open storage, then the minimum yard
that is required for such a lot under the applicable town ordinances shall be
provided and maintained, unless some other provision of this chapter requires
or permits a different minimum yard. However, front, side and rear yards shall
not be required on lots used for off-street parking, agricultural purposes,
open public areas or open space, but in no event shall structures associated
with such open land uses be located in the required minimum yards.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no structure shall be
