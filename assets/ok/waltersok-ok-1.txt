in order to provide for more efficient, adequate and economical government do
hereby amend the heretofore existing charter of the City of Walters, Oklahoma,

Walters; and do hereby ordain, ratify and establish this charter of the City of
Walters, Oklahoma, as the organic law of the city.
ARTICLE I
INCORPORATION, FORM OF GOVERNMENT, POWERS
Section 1 Incorporation.
   The City of Walters, Oklahoma, within the corporate limits as now
established or as hereafter may be established, shall continue to be a
municipal body politic and corporate in perpetuity under the name of the “City
of Walters, Oklahoma.” It shall succeed to and possess all the property,
rights, privileges, franchises, powers and immunities now belonging to the
corporation known as the City of Walters, Oklahoma; and shall be liable for all
debts and other obligations for which the corporation is now legally bound.
Section 2 Form of government.
   The municipal government provided by this charter shall be known as the
“council-manager government.” All powers of the city shall be exercised in the
manner prescribed by this charter, or, if the manner is not thus prescribed,
then in such manner as the council may prescribe by ordinance.
Section 3 Powers of the city.
   The city shall have all powers, functions, rights, privileges, franchises
and immunities granted to cities by the state constitution and law and all the
implied powers necessary to carry into execution all the powers granted. Except
as prohibited by the state constitution and law, the city shall have all
municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges, franchises and immunities of
every name and nature whatsoever.
   The city shall have power to adopt a corporate seal and to alter it at
pleasure, to sue and to be sued, and to make contracts. It shall have power to
acquire property within or without its corporate limits for any city purpose,
including public utilities, works and ways, in fee simple or any lesser
interest or estate, by purchase, gift, devise, lease, condemnation or other
legal means; and to hold, maintain, improve, enlarge, manage, control, operate,
lease, sell, convey or otherwise dispose of, such property as its interests may
require, including public utilities, works and ways. It shall have power to
issue bonds in the manner and within the limitations prescribed by the state
constitution and law. It shall have power, within the limits prescribed by the
state constitution and law, to accept and administer federal and state grants-
in-aid and to do everything necessary to accomplish the purpose or purposes for
which such grants may be made. It shall have power to ordain and to enforce
local legislation, consistent with the state constitution and law, for the
proper organization and functioning of the city government, for the
preservation and enforcement of good government and order, for the protection
of health, life, morals and property, for the preservation, summary abatement
and removal of nuisances, and otherwise for the promotion of the common

ARTICLE II
THE COUNCIL
Section 4 Council members: number, election, term, qualifications.
   There shall be a council, which shall consist of five (5) council members,
one elected at large and four (4) elected by wards. The electors shall elect
them as hereinafter provided for overlapping three-year terms, to serve until
their successors have been elected and take office. Only qualified electors of
the city who are at least twenty-five (25) years old, and who are freeholders
of the city, shall be qualified to be council members. A freeholder seeking to
represent a particular ward must be a resident of that ward. No council member
may hold any office or position in the city government by appointment by the
city manager. Subsequent to the ratification and approval of this amended
charter and contemporaneously with or prior to the resolution calling for the
1996 city elections, the council shall divide the city into four (4) wards
which shall be as co-equal in population as is reasonably possible; all of the
area in each ward shall be contiguous to the rest of the area in that ward.
Ward One shall include the residence of the council member whose term expires
in 1997. Ward Two shall include the residence of the council member whose term
expires in 1998. Wards Three and Four shall be drawn out of the rest of the
city. After the federal census is published every ten (10) years and
contemporaneously with or prior to the resolution calling for the next city
election, the council shall reapportion the wards so that they shall be as co-
equal in population as ins reasonably possible. If, as a result of
reapportionment, a council member no longer resides in his or her ward, he or
she shall continue to represent the ward until expiration of his or her term.
If a council member moves out of his or her ward and continues to reside within
the city, he or she may continue to represent that ward until the next
regularly-scheduled city election, at which time the office shall be deemed to
be vacant and a successor elected for the balance of the council member’s term.
If a council member moves outside the city, his or her office shall be deemed
vacated immediately, and the remaining council members shall appoint a
successor to serve the balance of that council member’s term.
(Amendment approved September 12, 1995)
Section 5 Mayor and vice mayor.
   Every year, at the first meeting after the time for the beginning of the
term of a newly elected council member or as soon after as practicable, the

until the time for the beginning of the term of the next newly elected council
member and until their respective successors have been elected and take office.

correct enrollment of all ordinances and resolutions passed by it. He or she
shall be recognized as the head of the city government for all ceremonial
purposes and by the governor for the purposes of military law. He or she shall
have no regular administrative duties except that he or she shall sign such
written obligations of the city as the council may require.

Municipal Judge may direct the total amount due to be entered upon the court
minutes and to be certified to the District Court in the county where the situs

mention) all buildings and improvements now or hereafter located thereon and

   (B)   This provision shall be referred to a vote of the electors of the city

(Prior Code, § 50.14) (Ord. 400, passed 5-27-1980)
PUBLIC WORKS AUTHORITY
§ 50.25 PROCEDURES ESTABLISHED.
   The following rules and regulations shall constitute the procedures that
will be followed by city personnel to facilitate the provision of municipal
utility services on a fair and consistent basis to all citizens of the city and
assure that appropriate measures have been taken to assure payment of amounts
owed to the City Public Works Authority.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012)
§ 50.26 NEW SERVICES.
   It shall be the practice of the Walters Public Works Authority (WPWA) to
provide municipal utility services, consisting of water, sewer, sanitation, and
electricity on a fair and non-discriminatory basis provided all the conditions
of service are met and maintained by the end user, citizen, consumer, city
resident, or commercial entity.
   (A)   Application must be made. New service connections shall be provided to
everyone who moves into town or the outskirts of town where WPWA provides
services provided that the consumer makes appropriate application for service
(s), provides all required information and documents, posts the required
deposits, and assumes responsibility for payment of the services provided.
      (1)   WPWA does not provide all municipal services in all areas of the
city. Some services in specific areas are available through other utility
providers. During the application process the employee taking the application
will check service area maps and inform the individual who the other providers
are, and provide contact information for those other providers.
      (2)   The individual shall completely fill out an application for service
as approved and amended by the City Council or WPWA Board of Trustees.
      (3)   The individual shall post the appropriate deposit(s) to secure
payment for the service(s) requested. Deposits shall be posted to the
appropriate account of the city or WPWA and retained for the period of time
prescribed by the Council/Board of Trustees.
      (4)   The employee shall prepare the appropriate work order for a meter
set (installation of electric or water meter) or service transfer to the
requesting individual.
   (B)   New service where no facilities currently exist.
      (1)   Individuals constructing new homes or business will complete the
same application as above. The employees will take their contact information
and complete the appropriate work order to notify the department supervisors
that construction of new facilities will be required. The department
supervisors will develop a timeline and estimate of construction costs. The
estimate will include the cost of labor, materials, overheads, and easements.
Where multiple services are required, multiple estimates will be made by each
affected department (water, sewer, electric).
      (2)   Construction estimate costs may exceed the free limit set by the
Council/Board of Trustees. In this event, the requesting individual or
developer shall be required to make a construction contribution to the city/
WPWA for the service extension before any construction begins. Such
contributions shall be recorded on the fixed asset accounting system as
contributed plant.
      (3)   When a contribution is required, individuals, businesses, or
developers may find those costs unreasonable. Department supervisors or the
City Manager shall work with the requesting entity to find less expensive
routing alternatives to make services available. This may include relocating
the home/business, rerouting utility services, or releasing the entity to
another service provider that may be closer or less costly.
   (C)   New service at an existing location.
      (1)   When an individual requests service(s) at an existing location or
address, the employee shall check the billing records to determine that the
service(s) has been disconnected or that the present customer has completed a
service disconnect form and that the form has been signed by the current
resident/owner. An application for service where a disconnect has not been
requested by the current resident/owner shall constitute a red flag event and
shall be documented in the red flag register. If and when this occurs, the
employee shall contact the current resident/owner and assure that they do in
fact desire to terminate services and that they intend to complete a service
disconnect form and sign it, or that they have vacated the premises.
      (2)   If the above conditions have been met, the employee will complete a
work order to set new meters or to have the existing meters read “in and out.”
      (3)   The in and out reading shall consist of one meter reading for the
metered services. The reading shall be the final reading for billing purposes
for the current resident/owner and the beginning reading for the new customer
moving into the location who assumes responsibility for the bill.
   (D)   Discontinuance of service.
      (1)   Service disconnect forms signed by the customer/owner will be
required to assure that service charges cease for the customer/owner leaving
the premises.
      (2)   Past experience has shown that customer/owner(s) often leave with
no notice, forwarding address, and owing a big bill, especially from rental
property. When it is determined that the current responsible customer has
vacated the premises, the billing clerk will make every effort to obtain a
forwarding address for the departing customers.
      (3)   Connection of a new customer will be in accordance with above rules
and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012)
§ 50.27 DEPOSITS.
   (A)   Deposits.
      (1) Deposits will be required of all new customers, for each city service
requested or provided to the location where their home or business is located.
The total deposit required will consist of the numeric sum of the individual
deposits.
      (2)   The deposit for each service shall be consistent with the service
deposits established by the City Council and approved in open public meeting
under state law.
      (3)   All service deposits shall be shown on a tariff sheet identified as
the schedule of deposits. A schedule so identified will be reviewed and amended
by the City Council periodically as they and city management deem necessary to
limit the city/WPWA exposure to unpaid balances.
      (4)   In addition to the initial deposit(s) to establish service, any
customer who pays late twice in any six consecutive-month period, or is on the
disconnect list, but not disconnected, shall have their deposit balance
reviewed. If their initial deposit is less than two times the average billing
for the most recent consecutive six months, the customers will be required to
post additional deposits equal to the two-months’ average billing.
         (a)   Customers who are required to pay additional deposits under the
above provisions, may elect to either pay the balance of the additional deposit
in one payment or spread it over three equal payments over the following three
months.
         (b)   Customers required to post additional deposits shall also pay
all current bills when due. Customers who fail to pay current shall be required
to pay all amounts, bills, and deposits immediately.
         (c)   Customers who default on making the additional deposits shall be
given ten days’ notice that service will be terminated if the default is not
cured.
         (d)   Customers who are still in default after ten days’ notice shall
have all services terminated.
      (5)   Customers in bankruptcy, other than liquidation, shall be required
to post a new deposit equal to two times the average monthly billing to secure
post petition consumption. The customer will be provided ten days’ notice of
the deposit requirement. If the new deposit is not paid within the ten-day
period, service shall be terminated until security deposits are paid in full.
   (B)   Refund of deposits. In the normal course of business, deposits will
not be refunded until the customer discontinues receiving service(s) from WPWA.
Upon service termination, deposits will be applied to any and all final
billings for the services rendered by WPWA. If deposits are insufficient to
cover final billings, the customers will be mailed a final billing at their new
address. Any deposit funds remaining after the final bill has been applied will
be returned to the customers as soon as possible by mailing it to their new
address.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012)
§ 50.28 DISCONNECTION FOR NONPAYMENT.
   It shall be the policy of the WPWA/city that services be terminated for
nonpayment in accordance with this approved disconnection procedure. Employees
shall assure that customers have been given the required notices, the number of
days, and provided with a list of other agencies, organization, or groups that
may be able to help them pay their bills.
   (A)   Utility bills shall be mailed to the customer at their service address
or business address. Bills will indicate the due date and the late payment due
if not paid on or before the due date.
   (B)   Customers who do not make payment seven days after the due date will
receive a disconnect notice, hand delivered to their door. The notice will
indicate that if payment has not been received within seven days of the notice
(that’s 14 days total), service will be discontinued/terminated.
   (C)   Individuals may contact the billing clerk and make other payment
arrangements. Persons who request additional time or payment arrangements will
be subject to deposit review and may be required to post additional deposits.
   (D)   Customers who have exhausted time limits and/or payment arrangements
will be disconnected for nonpayment without additional notice.
   (E)   Customers disconnected for nonpayment shall pay all amounts owed, past
due and current, disconnect fees, trip charges, and all other applicable fees
before service(s) are restored.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012)
§ 50.29 FEES.
   (A)   The following fees will be applied to utility bills paid late, or
requiring additional collection procedures.
      (1)   Bills not paid by the due date shown on the bill shall be charged
an additional 5% as shown on the bill as the “amount due if not paid by the due
date.”
      (2)   If the WPWA/city is required to hand deliver a disconnect notice,
an additional fee will be added to the bill.
      (3)   If the customer is physically disconnected, an additional fee will
be added to the bill (trip charge).
      (4)   If the customer then pays his or her bill and related charges, an
additional reconnect fee will be charged to the bill to cover the reconnect
trip costs.
      (5)   All fees and additional deposits must be paid before service(s) are
restored.
   (B)   A returned check fee will be assessed on all checks returned to the
WPWA regardless of the reason returned.
   (C)   These fees will be shown on a tariff sheet titled billing fee schedule
and will be subject to revision as the City Council/Board of trustees deem

(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012)
§ 50.30 DISCONNECTION OTHER THAN NONPAYMENT.
   The WPWA/city may disconnect or discontinue service(s) to customer for
reasons other than nonpayment to preserve the safety and welfare of city
residents, employees, or the general public.
   (A)   A service may be disconnected or discontinued without terminating all
utility services provided by WPWA/city.
   (B)   Water service will be discontinued to preserve health or due to
excessive leak. This can occur when a resident has a sewer leak or rupture, or
employees notice a significant water leak, and the resident does not correct
the problem, after being notified.
   (C)   All involved services will be terminated when theft of service is
discovered. Customers who have been disconnected and have not made arrangements
to have service restored will be monitored daily or weekly to assure that
service is not being stolen. When theft is discovered, employees will
immediately contact the police officer on duty for investigation and
prosecution.
      (1)   Normal disconnection practices will consist of removing electric
meters and turning off water main valves. When theft is discovered, electric
service will be terminated at the transformer or secondary voltage supply and
the water meter will be removed.
      (2)   Persons receiving the benefit of stolen services shall be
considered the offending party and shall be arrested, fined, or otherwise
prosecuted for the offense.
      (3)   Poly carts will be removed from the premises.
   (D)   All services will be terminated when an unsafe condition exists on the
premises that could cause fire, injury, or death due to the continuation of
such service.
   (E)   Customers who seasonally leave the city may request a suspension of
utility services. Customers may request that all utility services be suspended
or only specific services be suspended. Services will not be suspended for more
than six consecutive months.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.31 TRANSFER OF ACCOUNT.
   Since The WPWA/city now falls under the federal red flag rules, it becomes
necessary that the WPWA exercise higher security when transferring utility
services between individuals and businesses. It is not uncommon for utility
service to be transferred from one customer to another customer or from one
business entity to another. In the past this has been done informally over the
phone, since most people and business owners are known personally by WPWA
employees. To properly follow the new federal rules and guidelines, it is
necessary that this process be more formal and in writing. This will basically
require that people transferring services appear in person at City Hall and
complete the required paper work.
   (A)   Customers desiring to discontinue utility services should appear in
person at City Hall and complete a service disconnect form and sign it. This
form must indicate the final date that the customer wants to receive service.
      (1)   WPWA employees will assure that the work order to discontinue
service is executed on the day indicated on the service disconnect form.
      (2)   Before a physical service disconnect is made, the employee shall
review work orders to assure that a connect work order for a new customer is
not pending at the same physical address.
      (3)   If a connect order exists, the employee will convert the work order
to a “read in read out” order and not physically disconnect the services.
   (B)   When the customer desiring to discontinue service is a tenant, the
employee will make a physical disconnect unless the landlord, known to the
WPWA, has completed a service transfer form, properly signed it, and maintains
it on file with the WPWA. Service transfer forms shall be maintained in a file
established for that purpose.
   (C)   Landlords who have the proper documents completed will be responsible
for all the service costs from the “read in read out” readings forward, until
another tenant becomes responsible for that service billing.
   (D)   Landlords shall be responsible for the same services as the tenant,
and partial services shall not be allowed on a limited or partial basis.
   (E)   Transfer of accounts from one person or business, to another person or
business, will be allowed via telephone, mail, or email only when the person
(customer) has moved from town and is no longer in the area.
   (F)   Automatic transfer from a tenant to a landlord will be allowed,
provided the landlord has completed the necessary documentation and signed an
authorization with the WPWA.
   (G)   Employees will assure that all information is completed in full on the
service disconnect form, service transfer form, and the application for service
form to assure that WPWA has the proper address for billing, mailing of the
final billing, or the refund of unused deposits.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012)
§ 50.32 COLLECTION OF UNPAID BALANCES.
   (A)   The city/WPWA will mail final unpaid bills for three consecutive
months. If the customer has not paid at the end of 90 days (three months), the
account will be turned over to the collection professionals under contract with
the city/WPWA as approved, or as may be approved, by the City Council/Board of
Trustees.
   (B)   Customers who still refuse to pay amounts due will be referred to the
City Attorney for further legal action, in an effort to collect the bill. The
city/WPWA may file a law suit and seek court judgments in efforts to collect
the bill as advised by the City Attorney.
   (C)   Uncollectible accounts may be placed on a statewide list of non-paying
customers or other list(s) maintained by the State Tax Commission or other
state agency.
   (D)   The city/WPWA will maintain a list of old unpaid accounts, forever,
and should a customer ever move back to town and request services, they will be
required to pay all old bills and collection costs, court costs, and legal fees
before service will be rendered.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012)
§ 50.33 SUBTERFUGE.
   There will be occasions where a customer has been disconnected for
nonpayment and another person(s) is living in the household, either related or
unrelated, the other cohabitant will come to City Hall and request services be
established in their name, or the co-habitant who did not have the service in
his or her name will then move to another location (address) and attempt to
establish service, or they will establish service, in their name and then
allowed the other disconnected cohabitant to move in at the new location.
Anytime this occurs and the disconnected person with an outstanding bill
remains or becomes an occupant in the house, this act shall be considered
subterfuge, and service(s) will either be denied or disconnected. These acts
will be treated as an act of theft and referred to the Police Department for
prosecution or the City Attorney for recovery of amounts due.
(Prior Code, § 50.15) (Res. 785, passed 11-6-2012) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.34 TERMS OF SERVICE.
   All new customers will be provided these rules and regulations in writing
when they apply for initial service. They will be explained to the customer
verbally, and he or she will be asked to sign a statement that the rules and
regulations were explained to them and that they understood the requirements
for service. These signed forms shall be filed with the customers other
information and maintained by the city/WPWA.

charged for the collection and disposal of hazardous waste, in lieu of setting
a schedule of rates, the rate shall be a matter of negotiation between the
parties involved. In those situations where the city, in order to protect the

§ 71.05 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   The display of signal lights, arrows, and words shall be deemed to have the
following meanings and requires the appropriate response on the part of
vehicular traffic and pedestrians.
   (A)   Green alone, “Go.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless an official sign at such
place prohibits such turn, but any vehicle and any pedestrian lawfully within
the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal displays green
shall have the right-of-way over such vehicular traffic.
      (2)   Pedestrian traffic, facing a green signal, may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless a “Walk” signal
indicator is operating.
   (B)   Steady yellow or amber alone, “Caution.”
      (1)   The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute a
warning that the “Red” or “Stop” signal will be exhibited immediately
thereafter.
      (2)   Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near side
crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so near
the limit line when the “caution” signal first flashes that a stop cannot be
made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the
intersection and clear the same before the “red” signal flashes.
   (C)   Red alone, “Stop.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk and shall remain standing until green or “go” is shown alone.
      (2)   Except where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns,
vehicles in the right traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may
enter the intersection cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles
shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the
intersection and the turn shall be made so as not to interfere in any way with
traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the roadway
when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal
indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety.
No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or
“go” is shown alone unless authorized to do so, by a pedestrian “walk” signal.
   (D)   Steady red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic
lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated
by the arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   If the movement indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the
left turn shall be made only on the red with green arrow signal.
      (3)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or “go” is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian “walk”
signal.
   (E)   Green arrows alone. Whenever vehicular traffic movements are
controlled by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal
indication, vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by
the green arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are
displayed.

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject
to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

intermittent flashes, drivers or operators of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or pass such signal only with caution. Pedestrians shall not
proceed in conflict with traffic, but may activate the signal control switch,
and shall wait until steady red alone is shown before entering the roadway or
intersection controlled by the signal.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone. Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby
warned that the red or “Stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter,
and such vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection or
pass the signal when the red or “Stop” signal is exhibited. No pedestrian shall
enter the roadway or intersection on which the signal controls vehicular
traffic until steady red alone is shown.
   (C)   Steady red. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and shall remain
standing until flashing yellow is shown alone. Pedestrians may proceed across
the road controlled by the signal, and shall be given the right-of-way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (D)   Steady red and steady yellow combined.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
flashing yellow signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and that such
vehicular traffic shall remain standing until the flashing yellow is shown
alone.
      (2)   Pedestrians are thereby warned that the flashing yellow signal is
about to be shown, and shall not enter the signal-controlled roadway or
intersection, or in a direction which conflicts with the movement of vehicular
traffic; but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her crossing
shall proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island, and shall be given the
right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.

   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter “person
aggrieved”) may file a complaint with the chief executive officer. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as
the chief executive officer requires. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the
chief executive officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or
persons who allegedly committed or are about to commit the alleged
discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or
within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference under division
(C) below, the chief executive officer shall investigate the complaint and give
notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to resolve
it. If the chief executive officer decides to resolve the complaints, he or she
shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing
practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.
Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made
public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter
without the written consent of the persons concerned.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him or her and, with the leave of the chief executive officer, which
shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend
his or her answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If, within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the chief executive
officer, the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The chief executive officer will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30
days hereafter, commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent names in the complaint to enforce the rights granted or protected by
this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If
the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about
to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or
order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
chief executive officer shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain
voluntary compliance.

   (A)   (1)   In conducting an investigation, the chief executive officer
shall have access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents,
individuals, and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may
examine, record, and copy such materials and take and record the testimony or
statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of
the investigation; provided, however, that the chief executive officer first
complies with the provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable
searches and seizures.
      (2)   The chief executive officer may issue subpoena to compel his or her
access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such
persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and
subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or
interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United
States District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking
place. The chief executive officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the chief executive officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the chief executive officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show
on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they
were issued at his or her request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief executive officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   (1)   Within five days after services of a subpoena upon any person,
such person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena.
      (2)   The chief executive officer shall grant the petition if he or she
finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable
time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to
any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the chief
executive officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the Municipal or State Court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts
business.
   (F)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the chief
executive officer participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this
chapter.

§ 91.12 ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.
   (A)   The rights granted by §§
91.03 through
91.06 may be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 180 days after the
alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the
court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
91.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the chief executive officer are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained of in the complaint made to the chief executive officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however, that
any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of
the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter
shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and punitive damages as provided by law,
together with court costs and reasonable attorneys fees in the case of a
prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the plaintiff, in the opinion of the
court, is not financially able to assume the attorney’s fees.

93.999
§ 93.008 SUMMARY ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of one or
more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances
may be such as to justify, and even to require, the City Manager or other
appropriate officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and
proper action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the
danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   (B)   The Chief of the Fire Department, the Chief of Police, the City
Attorney, the Building Inspector, the Electrical Inspector, the Plumbing
Inspector, or any other officer subordinate to the City Manager may submit,
through or with the consent of the Mayor to the City Council, a statement as to
the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or law,
and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The City Manager himself or
herself, the Health Officer, any Council member, or any resident or residents
of the city may submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the
City Council.
   (C)   The Council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a
nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the
Council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers, and
other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the
Council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner
of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible
for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if
such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the
owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by
service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the
names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be
published in a paper of general circulation within the city.
   (D)   If the Council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
it within the specified time, the Council shall direct the City Manager to
abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as
authorized by 50 O.S. § 16. The City Clerk shall send a statement of the cost
of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or
causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names
and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the
city collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.
(Prior Code, § 93.008) (Ord. 2019-560, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 93.009 ABATEMENT BY SUIT IN DISTRICT COURT.
   In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance, the
city may bring suit in the District Court of the county where the nuisance is
located, as provided in 50 O.S. § 17.
(Prior Code, § 93.009) (Ord. 2019-560, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 93.010 NUISANCE UNLAWFUL.

permit a nuisance to remain on premises under his or her control within the
city.

   (A)   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 O.S. § 1-1011, the Health Officer
shall have authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises in
the city to remove from such premises, at his or her own expense, any source of
filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the breeding of insects or
rodents that might contribute to the transmission of disease, or any other
condition adversely affecting the public health, within 24 hours, or within
such other time as may be reasonable, and a failure to do so shall constitute
an offense.
      (1)   Such order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the
owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the Health
Officer or by a police officer, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual
place of abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state.
      (2)   If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner,
occupant, or agent is unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served
by posting a copy thereof on the premises, or by publication in at least one
issue of a newspaper having a general circulation in the city.
   (B)   If the order is not complied with, the Health Officer may cause the
order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified
to the City Clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be
added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if
he or she is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility
service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it
is added, and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same
regulations relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If
such owner or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost,
after certification to the City Clerk, may be collected in any manner in which
any other debt due the city may be collected.

which constitutes the violation(s) within ten days from the service of the
notice and administrative order, and the administrative officer for code
enforcement determines that such corrective action brings the property into
compliance with this code, no further action shall be taken by the city unless
the condition reoccurs within the six-month time frame granted by the original
administrative order. In which case, no further notice shall be required for
the city to abate the nuisance.

for code enforcement to correct the code violations and no extension of time
for appeal to the City Council shall be allowed.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 114.01 LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The intent of this chapter is to ensure the health and safety of all
state residents and provide reasonable and orderly regulation of medical
marijuana as authorized by the lawful passage of State Question 788. Only the
powers enumerated under this chapter shall be proper. Any power not
specifically enumerated is prohibited.
      (1)   Any person, persons, or entity violating any provisions of this
chapter, either by doing anything which is prohibited or by failing to do
anything which is commanded, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $500, plus court
costs. Each separate violation of this chapter shall constitute a separate
offense. Where a lesser fine is mandated by state law, the lesser amount of
fine shall be applicable.
      (2)   The regulations are intended to apply to all medical marijuana for
personal use or any medical marijuana business permitted under the State
Question 788. The code is intended to provide regulations to limit the impact
that medical marijuana cultivation and production will have on health, safety,
and community resources.
      (3)   Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and
transportation of medical marijuana remains illegal under federal law and
marijuana remains classified as a CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE by federal law.
      (4)   The regulations for medical marijuana uses are not adequate at the
state level to address the impacts of medical marijuana on the city, making it
appropriate for local regulation of the impacts of medical marijuana uses.
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter is intended to promote or condone the
production, distribution, or possession of marijuana in violation of any
applicable law.
      (6)   This chapter is to be construed to protect the public over medical
marijuana business interests. Operation of a medical marijuana business is a
revocable privilege and not a right in the city. There is no property right for
an individual or business to have medical marijuana in the city.
      (7)   Medical marijuana is a heavily regulated industry in the city and
all permittees are assumed to be fully aware of the law. The city shall not
therefore be required to issue warnings before issuing citations for violations
of this chapter.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare of the residents and patients of the city by prescribing the manner
in which medical marijuana businesses can be conducted in the city. Further,
the purpose of this chapter is to:
      (1)   Provide for a means of cultivation, production, and distribution of
marijuana to patients who qualify to obtain, possess, and use marijuana for
medical purposes under the State Question 788;
      (2)   Protect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on
business operations as they relate to noise, air, and water quality, food
safety, neighborhood and patient safety, security for the business and its
personnel, and other health and safety concerns;
      (3)   Impose fees to cover the cost to the city of permitting medical
marijuana businesses in an amount sufficient for the city to recover its cost
of the permitting program;
      (4)   Adopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of
this chapter;
      (5)   Create regulations that address the particular needs of the
patients and residents of the city and coordinate with laws that may be enacted
by the state regarding the issue;
      (6)   Facilitate the implementation of State Question 788 without going
beyond the authority granted by it; and
      (7)   Issue medical marijuana business permits only to individuals and
entities that have demonstrated an intent and ability to comply with this
chapter without monitoring by city officials.

(Prior Code, § 151.24) (Ord. 2019-562, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 151.25 MOTOR HOMES, RVs, TRAVEL TRAILERS.
   Due to the number of residents that now own some type of RV, travel trailer,
or motor home, the City Council finds it necessary to establish the following
set of regulations to ensure that the parking, storage, and maintenance of
these vehicles is consistent with other established ordinances in the various
neighborhoods and that the regulations are consistent city wide.
   (A)   Parking.
      (1)   Motor homes, travel trailers, and other RVs are not designed, nor
intended by the manufacturer, to be occupied on a permanent basis. These
vehicles are intended for temporary housing while traveling and camping.
However, permanent residence shall be permitted on the same basis as
manufactured homes, provided all provisions of this chapter are followed.
      (2)   Motor homes, travel trailers, and other RVs shall be allowed to
park on the street near a residence, in the driveway forward of the front build
line for a period not to exceed 48 hours to facilitate loading, unloading, and
cleaning in preparation for a trip or when returning from a trip. Such parked
units may not impede traffic or block views of adjacent traffic.
      (3)   Motor homes, travel trailers, and other RVs shall not be parked
forward of the build line at any residence for any reason for a period
exceeding 48 hours. (Exception: An exception is granted for residents on a
corner lot. An RV parked parallel to the alley on a corner lot(s) may exceed
the build line of the residence where the home is turned facing the adjacent
street).
      (4)   Maintenance shall not be performed on any vehicle of this type
while parked in front of the build line.
      (5)   Parking shall be allowed in back yards and side yards, provided
such parking does not violate any subdivision regulations or covenants. Covered
parking shall only be allowed as approved in the zoning ordinances.
      (6)   Permanent connections to city utility services; water, sewer, and
electric shall be permitted provided the provisions of this chapter are
complied with and all permits have been obtained. Any vehicles found connected
in violation of this section shall be cause for service termination after
proper notice to cease and desist has been delivered to the resident. Temporary
connections will only be allowed in designated RV parks or mobile home parks
with RV spaces unless approved, in advance, on a individual basis by the City
Manager or his or her appointee.
      (7)   Individuals who persist in the connection of utility services to
these vehicles shall be cause for the city to have the vehicle towed and
impounded at the owner’s expense.
      (8)   Vehicles in this section may be used for an extended period as
construction offices, temporary commercial offices, labs, and for other
purposes, and may be connected to city utility services for the required period
of time necessary to facilitate the construction of permanent structures. Any
vehicle used under this provision, for periods exceeding more than six months
shall be approved by the City Council.
   (B)   Storage.
      (1)   Motor homes, travel trailers, and other RVs shall not be connected
to city utility services when stored at any location in the city limits. A
permit may be obtained from City Hall allowing for electrical connection to be
made to maintain a chargeable/rechargeable system that is built-in to the unit.
Permits will be at no cost, however, at no time can this unit be occupied while
stored at a residence.
      (2)   Vehicles in this section may be stored at a residence, provided
that they are behind the front build line and such storage complies with all
subdivision regulations and covenants.
      (3)   Stored vehicles in this section may not be positioned so as to
interfere with alleys or access to backyards, or in any other way impede
firefighting capabilities or restrict access of other residents.
      (4)   (a)   Stored vehicles in this section that are found in disrepair,
deteriorating due to age and/or weather damage, or have not been tagged shall
be deemed a nuisance.
         (b)   The owner will be notified to remediate the condition
immediately. Once notified, the city will work with the owner and establish a
time line for the remediation. Under no circumstances shall the remediation
exceed four months (120 days).
         (c)   If the owner fails to resolve the nuisance, the city will remove
the offending vehicle, and assure that it is properly disposed of, at the
owner’s expense.
      (5)   Offsite storage of motor homes, travel trailers, other RVs, boats,
miscellaneous equipment, and other mobile equipment and vehicles will be
allowed in areas designated and zoned for that purpose.
      (6)   Such storage sites will be located in zones designated as C-1 and/
or areas approved by the City Council.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in 82 O.S.
§§ 1601 through 1618, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council hereby adopts this chapter, to become effective
immediately.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation, which could result in loss of life and property, creates health and
safety hazards, may disrupt commerce and governmental services, and results in
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are primarily created by the cumulative effect
of backwater in the East Cache Creek watershed. The flooding from backwater
normally is the result of unusual rains in the upper Cache Creek watershed,
which causes an increase in lake levels at Lake Ellsworth and Lake Lawtonka.
During unusual rain events, the City of Lawton is required to open flood gates
at both lakes to assure the integrity of the lakes which, from time to time,
results in flooding downstream in the Walters area. Areas inside the city
limits are in the floodplain and have residential and nonresidential structures
that are either abandoned or still occupied and existed prior to floodplain
management practices by the state and the city. These structures were
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in the floodplain;
      (6)   Providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
floodplain area.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish these
purposes, this chapter shall use the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit construction and development in the floodplain
that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood, or cause
excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

regulations, special purpose regulations and ordinances (such as floodplain,
grading and erosion control regulations and ordinances), this chapter, and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
ordinances, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose
of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM. Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the areas within the city subject to a “special flood hazard” and the extent of
the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane
tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood
modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
standards.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT BOARD. The Walters City Council.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated

and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of 44 C.F.R. § 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which

flood elevations shown on the city flood insurance rate map are referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management ordinance adopted by the City Council and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the

PERMANENT CONSTRUCTION does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage,”
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or

alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by the city to a person from the terms of these
regulations when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
VARIANCE, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by these regulations.

§ 152.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which these regulations apply. This chapter shall apply to
all areas of special flood hazard within the incorporated jurisdiction of the
city.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard are identified by FEMA in a flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) for the flood areas inside the city limits. FIRM maps and flood
boundaries may be amended from time to time by FEMA, or a successor agency.
Such revisions or new flood inundation map(s), are hereby adopted and declared
to be part of this chapter.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions
of this chapter.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered,
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of these
regulations and other applicable city ordinances.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions; however, where this chapter and any other regulations, easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (G)   Warning and disclaimer or liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions,
greater floods can and will occur, and flood heights may be increased by human-
made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the
areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free
from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on
the part of the city or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.

      (1)   The City Board of Adjustments may grant variances for uses which do
not satisfy the requirements of 82 O.S. §§ 1601 et seq., the State Floodplain
Management Act, or this chapter if the applicant for the variance presents
adequate proof that:
         (a)   Compliance with these regulations will result in an arbitrary
and unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to
the people; and
         (b)   Satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section; however, no
variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit
the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
      (2)   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the State Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the state.
      (3)   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than 20
years.
      (4)   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the City
Board of Adjustments, accompanied by a filing fee in an amount to be set by the
City Council from time to time.
      (5)   (a)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, provided the relevant factors in §
152.04(C), and this section has been fully considered.
         (b)   As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance shall also increase.
      (6)   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Chairperson of the City
Board of Adjustments which states that:
         (a)   The cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than
the base flood elevation; and
         (b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
      (7)   At such time as the City Board of Adjustments deems the petition
ready for notification to the public, the Board of Adjustments shall schedule a
hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of
general circulation in the city at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
      (8)   (a)   The City Board of Adjustments shall conduct the hearing and
make determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
section.
         (b)   The Board of Adjustments shall exercise wide discretion in
weighing the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the
applicant and to the public at large when determining whether the variance
shall be recommended to the City Council for approval.
      (9)   Variances shall only be recommended based upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations, or ordinances; and
         (d)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (10)   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the
intent of this chapter, the Board of Adjustments may attach such conditions to
the recommendation of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes
and objectives stated in §
152.01(C).
      (11)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance recommended by the Board of Adjustments and shall be sent by the
Floodplain Administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within 15 days after the City
Council approves and issues the variance.
   (B)   Special provisions.
      (1)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of these regulations.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result
      (3)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent us, provided that:
         (a)   The criteria of divisions (A)(5), (A)(9), (B)(2), and (B)(3)
above are met; and
         (b)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.
