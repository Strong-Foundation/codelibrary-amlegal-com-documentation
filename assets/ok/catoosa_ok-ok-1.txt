plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the violation charged at any time before
he is required to appear for arraignment by indicating such plea on the copy of
the citation furnished to him or on a legible copy thereof, together with the

compact, and shall in all other cases, notify the state department of public

Provided however, the court or court clerk's failure to furnish such proof or
notice in the manner provided for in this subsection B8 shall in no event
create any civil liability upon the court, the court clerk, the state or any
political subdivision thereof, or any state department or agency or any
employee thereof, but duplicate proof shall be furnished to the person entitled
thereto upon request. (1992 Code § 6-114; amd. 2006 Code)

City shall determine to be just, necessary and reasonable for the proper
defense of such indigent's case;

acting or purporting to act under the provisions of this chapter. All the taxes
for the period for which a return is required to be filed shall be due from the
operator and payable to the director on or before the date fixed for the filing

surety company authorized to transact business in the state, in such amount as
the director may fix to secure the payment of any tax or penalties and interest
due, or which may become due from such operator.
   B.   In the event that the director determines that an operator is to file
such bond, he shall give notice to such operator specifying the amount of bond
required. The operator shall file such bond within five (5) days after the

council. Such determination shall be final and shall be compiled within fifteen
(15) days thereafter.

such amount as he may prescribe, may be deposited with the director who may at
any time after five (5) days' notice to the depositor, apply them to any tax or
any penalties due, and for that purpose, the securities may be sold at private
or public sale. (1992 Code § 7-812)

assessment, shall apply in writing to the city council for a hearing, or unless
the director, on his own motion, shall reassess the same. After such hearing,
the city council shall give written notice of its determination to the person
against whom the tax is assessed, and such determination shall be final. (1992
Code § 7-813)

the director. Whenever a refund is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated
in writing. Such application may be made by the person upon whom such tax was
imposed and who has actually paid the tax. Such application may also be made by
the person who has collected and paid such tax to the director; provided, that
the application is made within two (2) years of the payment by the occupant to
the operator, but no refund of money shall be made to the operator until he has
repaid to the occupant the amount for which the application for the refund is
made. The director, in lieu of any refund required to be made, may allow credit
therefor on payments due from the applicant.
   B.   Upon application for a refund, the director may receive evidence with
respect thereof and make such investigation as he deems necessary. After making
a determination as to the refund, the director shall give notice thereof to the
applicant. Such determination shall be final unless the applicant, within
ninety (90) days after such notice, shall apply in writing to the city council
for a hearing. After such hearing, the city council shall give written notice
of its decision to the applicant. (1992 Code § 7-814)

   A.   Summary Abatement: Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a
grave and immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of
one or more persons or the public generally. It is recognized that
circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to require the mayor/code
enforcement officer or other appropriate officer or agency of the city
government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such
nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can
be taken toward such abatement.
   B.   Statement Of Nuisance; Recommended Abatement: The chief of the fire
department, the chief of police, the code enforcement officer, the building
inspector, the city inspector or any other officer subordinate to the mayor may
submit, through or with the consent of the mayor, to the city council, a
statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the
city or law, and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The mayor
himself, the code enforcement officer, any council member, or any resident or
residents of the city may submit such a statement and request a recommendation
to the city council.
   C.   Determination Of Nuisance Existence; Notice: The city council shall
determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the
purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the council shall have power to
subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects. Before
proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the council shall give
notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property
concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible for or to be
causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice
and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the owner and other
persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by a police
officer if their names and addresses are known; but if the names or addresses
are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person
or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the
necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of
general circulation within the city.
   D.   Abatement By Owner Or City; Costs A Debt: If the council finds that a
nuisance does in fact exist, it shall direct the owner or other persons
responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if
the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person or persons or public
adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If
such peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by
the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons responsible for or
causing the nuisance do not abate it within the specified time, the council
shall direct the mayor or code enforcement officer to abate the nuisance or to
have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 Oklahoma
Statutes section 16. The city clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such
summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the
nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses
are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city
collectable as other debts of the city may be collected. (1992 Code § 8-108)
5-2-9: ABATEMENT BY SUIT IN DISTRICT COURT:
In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance, the city
may bring suit in the district court of the county where the nuisance is
located, as provided in 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 17. (1992 Code § 8-109)
5-2-10: ABATEMENT OF HEALTH NUISANCES:
   A.   Order To Abate: Pursuant to authority granted by 63 Oklahoma Statutes
section 1-1011, the code enforcement officer or health officer shall have the
authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises in the city to
remove from such premises, at his own expense, any source of filth, cause of
sickness, condition conducive to the breeding of insects or rodents that might
contribute to the transmission of disease, or any other condition adversely
affecting the public health, within twenty four (24) hours, or within such
other time as may be reasonable, and a failure to do so shall constitute an
offense. Such order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the
owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the health
officer or by the code enforcement officer or a police officer, or a copy
thereof may be left at the last usual place of abode of the owner, occupant, or
agent, if known and within the state. If the premises are unoccupied and the
residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is unknown, or is without the state,
the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on the premises, or by
publication in at least one issue of a newspaper having a general circulation
in the city.
   B.   Failure To Comply; Abatement By City; Costs: If the order is not
complied with, the health officer or code enforcement officer may cause the
order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified
to the city clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be
added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if
he is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility service.
The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added,
and shall become due and payable and subject to the same regulations relating
to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself 1 . If such owner or
occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost, after
certification to the city clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any
other debt due the city may be collected. (1992 Code § 8-111)

the city may pursue a civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and
interest thereon by an action in person against the property owner and an
action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest,
if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface owner, shall
not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this chapter.

5-4-3: BOARDING AND SECURING DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS:
   A.   After a building has been declared dilapidated, as provided in section
5-4-2 of this chapter, and before the commencement of the tearing and removal
of a dilapidated building, the administrative officer may authorize that such a
building be boarded and secured. However, if the dilapidated building is vacant
and unfit for human occupancy, the administrative officer may authorize the
structure to be demolished pursuant to section
5-4-2 of this chapter.
   B.   The administrative officer may cause the premises on which an unsecured
building is located to be cleaned of trash and weeds in accordance with the
provisions of section
5-4-2 of this chapter.
   C.   The administrative officer may cause an unsecured building to be
boarded and secured in accordance with the following procedures:
      1.   Notices: Before the administrative officer orders such action, at
least ten (10) days' notice that such unsecured building is to be boarded and
secured shall be given by mail to any property owners and mortgage holders as
provided in section
5-4-2 of this chapter. At the time of mailing of notice to any property owner
or mortgage holder, the city shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal
service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and
address of the mailee. A copy of the notice shall also be posted on the
property to be affected. However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage
holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on
the property or by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
city, one time, not less than ten (10) days prior to any hearing or action by
the city pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the administrative
officer anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the
provisions of subsection C9a of this section, the notice shall state: a) that
any subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six (6)
month period after the initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant
to such notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the administrative
officer; b) that the costs of such boarding and securing shall be assessed
against the owner; and c) that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure
such payment, all without further prior notice to the property owner or
mortgage holder.
      2.   Consent Of Owner For City To Board And Secure: The owner of the
property may give written consent to the city authorizing the boarding and
securing of such unsecured building and to the payment of any costs incurred
thereby. By giving written consent, the owner waives any right the owner has to
a hearing by the administrative officer.
      3.   Hearing; Decision And Action: If the property owner does not give
written consent to such actions, a hearing may be held by the administrative
officer to determine whether the boarding and securing of such unsecured
building would promote and benefit the public health, safety or welfare. Such
hearing may be held in conjunction with a hearing on the accumulation of trash
or the growth of weeds or grass on the premises of such unsecured building held
pursuant to the provisions of subsection 5-4-2C of this chapter. In making such
determination, the administrative officer shall apply the following standard:
The administrative officer may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured
building when the boarding and securing thereof would make such building less
available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such
building, or decrease the hazard that such building would constitute an
attractive nuisance to children. Upon making the required determination, the
administrative officer may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured
building.
      4.   Notice Of Lien: After the administrative officer orders the boarding
and securing of such unsecured building, the city clerk shall immediately file
a notice of unsecured building and lien with the county clerk describing the
property, stating the findings of the city at the hearing at which such
building was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the city claims a
lien on the property for the costs of boarding and securing such building and
that such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and
after the date of filing the notice.
      5.   Entry Powers To Board And Secure: Pursuant to the order of the
administrative officer, the agents of the city are granted the right of entry
on the property for the performance of the boarding and securing of such
building and for the performance of all necessary duties as a governmental
function of the city.
      6.   Costs: After an unsecured building has been boarded and secured, the
administrative officer shall determine the actual costs of such actions and any
other expenses that may be necessary in conjunction therewith, including the
cost of the notice and mailing. The city clerk shall forward a statement of the
actual costs attributable to the boarding and securing of the unsecured
building and a demand for payment of such costs, by mail to any property owners
and mortgage holders as provided in section
5-4-2 of this chapter. At the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any
property owner or mortgage holder, the city shall obtain a receipt of mailing
from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and
the name and address of the mailee. If the city boards and secures any
unsecured building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual
cost of the labor, materials and equipment required for the performance of such
actions. If such actions are done on a private contract basis, the contract
shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder.
      7.   Payment Of Costs; Failure To Pay:
         a.   When payment is made to the city for costs incurred, the city
clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to the actual
costs of the boarding and securing of the unsecured building is not made within
thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner of
such property, the city clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount
of the costs to the county treasurer of the county in which the property is
located. Once certified to the county treasurer, payment may only be made to
the county treasurer except as otherwise provided for in this section. At the
time of collection, the county treasurer shall collect a fee of five dollars
($5.00) for each parcel of property, and such fee shall be deposited to the
general fund of the county. The costs shall be levied on the property and
collected by the county treasurer as are other taxes authorized by law. Until
fully paid, the costs and the interest thereon shall be the personal obligation
of the property owner from and after the date the notice of unsecured building
and lien is filed with the county clerk.
         b.   In addition, the costs and the interest thereon shall be a lien
against the property from the date the notice of the lien is filed with the
county clerk. The lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and
all other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and superior to all
other titles and liens against the property. The lien shall continue until the
costs and interest are fully paid.
         c.   If the county treasurer and the city agree that the county
treasurer is unable to collect the assessment, the city may pursue a civil
remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon by an action in
personam against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien
against the property. A mineral interest, if severed from the surface owner,
shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this
section. Upon receiving payment, the city clerk shall forward to the county
treasurer a notice of such payment and shall direct discharge of the lien.
      8.   Appeals: The property owner or mortgage holder shall have a right of
appeal to the city council from any order of the administrative officer. Such
appeal shall be taken by filing written notice of appeal with the city clerk
within ten (10) days after the administrative order is rendered.
      9.   Summary Boarding And Securing:
         a.   If the administrative officer causes a structure within the city
limits to be boarded and secured, any subsequent need for boarding and securing
within a six (6) month period constitutes a public nuisance and may be
summarily boarded and secured without further prior notice to the property
owner or mortgage holder. At the time of each such summary boarding and
securing, the city shall notify the property owner and mortgage holder of the
boarding and securing and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the
property owner may request an appeal with the city clerk within ten (10) days
after the mailing of the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as provided
for in subsection C1 of this section. Unless otherwise determined at the
hearing, the cost of such boarding and securing shall be determined and
collected as provided for in subsections C6 and C7 of this section.
         b.   The administrative officer may determine that a building is
unsecured and order that such building be boarded and secured in the manner
provided for in this subsection C even though such building has not been
declared by the administrative officer to be dilapidated.
   D.   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property zoned
and used for agricultural purposes. (1992 Code § 8-303; amd. 2006 Code)

and the person, firm, or corporation who tore down the house or building shall
immediately comply with the provisions of this chapter by having all of the
requirements done. (1992 Code § 8-304)
5-4-5: PERMIT TO TEAR DOWN; FAILURE TO OBTAIN:
Any person who shall tear down or begin the tearing down of any house or

including the development, excavation, grading, regrading, paving, landfilling,
berming, and diking of land shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize
erosion and prevent the discharge of pollutants, including, but not limited to,
rock, sand, and soil into the city's MS4. Persons conducting the construction
shall implement and maintain adequate structural and/or nonstructural BMPs for
controlling the discharge of pollutants. For developments less than ten (10)
acres, the developer, or responsible person, shall include in their site plan
siltation devices and general stormwater control measures. For developments ten
(10) acres and more, a sediment basin or adequate alternate measures shall be
implemented as defined within the required and approved stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SP3) submitted by the developer, or responsible person, to the
city. The adequacy of any BMP shall be based upon the fulfillment of the
following requirements:
      1.   The discharge shall not result in a violation of the city's OPDES
municipal stormwater discharge permit;
      2.   The discharge, based upon the determination of the administrative
officer, shall not cause contamination of surface water, stormwater or

practices is to minimize erosion and sedimentation during construction
activities until final grading, landscaping and storm sewer structures are in
place. Best management practices include, but are not limited to, seeding,
sodding, sprigging, silt fences, straw bale dikes, earth dikes or swales,
temporary stream crossings, storm sewer inlet protection, temporary sediment
basins and stabilized construction entrances.
      2.   Failure to provide sediment and erosion control protection can
result in suspension of building permits. A violation of this section by
failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute an offense and
any person or entity convicted thereof shall be punishable as set forth in this
code. Provided, that each lot upon which such violation occurs shall constitute
a separate offense; and each day on which a violation occurs or is allowed to
remain shall constitute a separate offense. The imposition of criminal
sanctions, pursuant to section
5-8-15 of this chapter, shall not prevent the city of Catoosa from taking any
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy a violation.
      3.   Construction sites shall adhere to the standards set in the city of
Catoosa subdivision regulations, stormwater code, and design criteria for
stormwater, erosion control, streets, water, and sewers.

hours of less than one-tenth inch (0.1") of rainfall; and
      3.   All outfalls from the premises or industry must be sampled, unless
otherwise specified.
   B.   Sampling: When the administrative officer has reason to believe that
any person or industrial facility is violating this chapter, the person or
industrial facility may be required to obtain either a grab or composite sample
and analyze any discharge, stormwater, groundwater and/or sediment and provide
a copy of the analysis to the administrative officer for review.
   C.   Illicit Discharge Sampling: When the administrative officer has cause
to believe that any discharge is an illicit discharge, the administrative
officer may obtain either a grab or composite sample and analyze the discharge.
If it is determined that the discharge is an illicit discharge, then the
administrative officer may fully recover all cost of the sampling and analysis
from the person or industrial facility, including all reasonable and customary
administrative costs. When the discharge is likely to contain illicit
discharges on a recurring basis, the person or industrial facility may be
required by the administrative officer to conduct monitoring activities at its
expense. This may be in addition to monitoring activities performed by the
city.
   D.   Chain Of Custody: Beginning with obtaining sample collections a written
record of the chain of custody must be maintained. The chain of custody record
is an accurate step by step documentation of the sampling path from origin
through analysis. It must contain the following information:
      1.   Name of the person(s) collecting the sample;
      2.   Sample ID numbers;
      3.   Date and time of sample collection;

A copy of the chain of custody will remain with all sample analyses sent to the
city of Catoosa for review.
   E.   Substitution Of Substantially Identical Effluents: When a person or
industry is required to sample a storm event and that person or industry has
two (2) or more point sources with substantially identical effluents, the
person or industry may petition the administrative officer to allow the
sampling of only one point source and report that the data apply to the
substantially identical point source(s).
   F.   Monitoring Methods: Monitoring must be conducted according to test
procedures approved under 40 CFR part 136, unless other test procedures have
been specified by the administrative officer. (Ord. 2016-404-C, 3-28-2016)
5-8-12: REQUIREMENTS FOR BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:

limits of the city and not to ever be again allowed within the corporate limits
of the city, and that the owner shall pay all fees required.

within the corporate limits of the city under the conditions specified as
follows:
               (A)    Payment of all fees required in this section.
               (B)   That the animal be leashed and muzzled. No person covered
by this requirement shall permit the animal to go outside its kennel or pen
unless the animal is securely leashed with a leash no longer than four feet
(4') in length. No person shall permit the animal to be kept on a chain, rope
or other type of leash outside its kennel or pen unless a person is in physical

such animal from biting persons or other animals.
               (C)   That the animal be confined. All animals covered by this

this requirement may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or
structure that would allow the animal to exit such building on its own
volition. In addition, no such animal may be kept in a house or structure when
the windows or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the animal from
exiting the structure.
               (E)   That a warning sign be displayed. All owners, keepers or
harborers of animals covered by this requirement shall display in a prominent
place on the premises where the animal is kept a sign easily readable by the
public using the words "BEWARE OF VICIOUS ANIMAL". In addition, a similar sign
is required to be posted on the kennel or pen of such animal.

and sentence is imposed by the judge pursuant to this subsection, upon written
demand, may appeal the judge's decision within ten (10) days to the district
court of the county in the same manner as other appeals from actions of the
municipal court.
      2.   If the judge finds that an animal is a nuisance, he may order
destruction of the animal or other penalty or action provided in subsection A1
of this section or this code. If the owner of such animal shall provide good
and sufficient bond as set by the judge with surety, approved by the court,
conditioned that the owner shall abate and prevent the nuisance, the court may
order the return of the animal to the owner upon payment of the impoundment or
other fees and the approval of the surety. In no event shall a dog be returned
to the owner if it is not vaccinated, registered or licensed as required in
this chapter.
      3.   On other violations of this chapter, the judge may take whatever
action deemed necessary, including, but not limited to, the actions in

unnecessary police emergency response to false alarms and protect the emergency
response capability of the City. A study of alarm responses for the City of
Catoosa indicated that false alarms are caused almost exclusively by either
human failure to use the system properly or mechanical failure resulting from
malfunction or poor design. By coming to the understanding that, other than
actual criminal activity, there is no valid reason for an alarm to activate,
the police can better target responses to crime.
   B.   This chapter draws a distinction between police response to requests by
individual persons and police response to requests made by mechanical devices.
It is the policy of the City of Catoosa Police Department to respond to valid
requests for service. Nothing in this chapter lessens or increases that
responsibility. It is also understood that many requests for service to
mechanical activations are not valid calls for service and the resident does
not want the police to respond. (Ord. 2023-437-C, 5-8-2023)

Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the word
"Go", "Caution" or "Stop", or exhibiting different colored lights successively
one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be used, and the
terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and
pedestrians as follows:
   A.   Green Alone Or "Go":
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the green alone or "Go" signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign or barricade at such place
prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the
time such signal is exhibited; and
      2.   Pedestrians facing a green alone or "Go" signal may proceed across
the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   B.   Steady Yellow Alone:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the steady yellow alone signal is thereby
warned that the red or "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter,
and such vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when
the red or "Stop" signal is exhibited; and
      2.   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow alone signal are thereby advised
that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then
starting to cross shall yield right of way to all vehicles.
   C.   Steady Red Alone Or "Stop":
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the steady red alone or "Stop" signal shall
stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if
none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until
green or "Go" is shown alone. However, vehicles in the right traffic lane,
after making a stop as above required, may enter the intersection cautiously
and make a right turn unless "No Turn On Red" signs are posted to prohibit
right turns; but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to any pedestrian or
other traffic in the intersection, and such turn shall not be made so as to
interfere with traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross
street; and
      2.   No pedestrian facing a steady red alone or "Stop" signal shall enter
the roadway until the green or "Go" is shown alone or until authorized so to do
by a pedestrian "Walk" signal.

cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, but shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection;
      2.   No pedestrian facing a steady red with green arrow signal shall
enter the roadway until the green or "Go" is shown alone or until authorized so
to do by pedestrian "Walk" signal; and
      3.   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking

sidewalk or safety zone while the "Wait" signal is showing. (1992 Code § 15-
206; amd. 2006 Code)
   B.   Whenever a pedestrian actuated school crossing signal is provided, it
requires obedience by vehicular traffic and pedestrians as provided in
subsection A of this section and section
7-2-8 of this chapter. (1992 Code § 15-208; amd. 2006 Code)

         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the steady red and steady yellow
combined signal is thereby warned that the flashing yellow signal will be
exhibited immediately thereafter, and that such vehicular traffic shall remain
standing until the flashing yellow is shown alone; and (1992 Code § 15-208)
         b.   Pedestrians are thereby warned that the flashing yellow signal is
about to be shown, and shall not enter the signal controlled roadway or

to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which
is approaching so closely on the highway as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver having so yielded may proceed only when it is prudent and apparently
safe to do so. (1992 Code § 15-807)
   D.   Vehicles Entering Yield Intersections:
      1.   The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in obedience
to such sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions, or
shall stop if necessary and yield the right of way to any pedestrian legally
crossing the roadway on which he is driving and to any vehicle in the
intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an
immediate hazard. If such driver is involved in a collision with a pedestrian
in a crosswalk or a vehicle in the intersection after driving past a yield
sign, such collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his failure to
yield the right of way.
      2.   The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign, if required for
safety to stop, shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection, or in the event there is no crosswalk, at a clearly marked
stop line, but if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway.
(1992 Code § 15-808)
7-3-4: ONE-WAY STREETS AND ALLEYS:
   A.   Authority To Designate: The city council, by resolution, may designate
any street or alley or part thereof as a one-way street or alley. Signs

intersection where movement of traffic in the opposite direction is prohibited.
(1992 Code § 15-1001)
   B.   Direction Of Traffic:
      1.   Upon those streets and parts of streets and in those alleys and
parts of alleys designated as one-way streets and alleys, vehicular traffic
shall move only in the indicated direction when signs indicating the direction
of traffic are erected and maintained at every intersection where movement in
the opposite direction is prohibited. (1992 Code § 15-1002)
      2.   A vehicle passing around a rotary traffic island shall be driven
only to the right of such island. (1992 Code § 15-1003)
7-3-5: SPEED RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Reasonable And Proper:
      1.   Notwithstanding a maximum speed limit enumerated in this section, no
person shall drive a vehicle upon any alley, highway, roadway, street or public
parking area at a speed greater than or less than is reasonable or prudent
under the conditions then existing, considering visibility, amount of traffic,
condition of roadway surface, presence of pedestrians, obstruction of view and
other similar facts.
      2.   No person shall drive any vehicle upon a street at a speed greater
than will permit him to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance
ahead.
   B.   Speed Limits Established:
      1.   Generally: Except when a special hazard exists that requires lower
speed for compliance with subsection A of this section, the limits specified in
this section or established as authorized shall be maximum lawful speeds. No
person shall drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed in excess of such maximum
limits as follows:
         a.   Twenty five (25) miles per hour on any street in a residential
district, except as may be posted otherwise and except on state or federal
highways; and
         b.   Miles per hour as posted in school zones when school is in
session.
      2.   Authority To Alter Speed Limits: The mayor has authority to post
lower speed limits than those prescribed in this section where special hazards
exist.
   C.   Duty To Decrease Speed: The fact that the speed of a vehicle is lower
than the designated limits shall not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon
any narrow winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic, or by reason of weather or highway conditions,
and speed shall be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any
person or vehicle or on entering the roadway in compliance with legal
requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care and precaution. (1992
Code § 15-701)
   D.   Minimum Speed: It is unlawful for any person to drive a motor vehicle
at such slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of
traffic, except when reduced speed is necessary for safe operation. Police
officers are hereby authorized to enforce this subsection by directions to
drivers, and in the event of wilful disobedience to this provision or refusal
to comply with the direction of an officer in accordance herewith, the
continued slow operation by a driver shall be unlawful and constitute a
blocking of traffic and a violation of this subsection. (1992 Code § 15-702)
7-3-6: SCHOOL ZONES:
   A.   Signs Posted: The mayor, subject to direction by the council, is

traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left side of the
center of the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use such
lanes, or except as permitted under subsection A2 of this section. However,
this subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the
centerline in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway. (1992 Code § 15-501; amd. 2006 Code)
7-3-8: DRIVING ON ROADWAYS LANED FOR TRAFFIC:
