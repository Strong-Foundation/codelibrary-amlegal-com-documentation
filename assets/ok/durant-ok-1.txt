recognizance based upon a signed written promise to appear for arraignment is
conditional and that failure to timely appear for arraignment shall result in
the suspension of the arrested person’s driver’s license in this state or in

notice in the manner provided for in this division (F) shall in no event create
any civil liability upon the court, the Court Clerk, the state, or any
political subdivision thereof or any state department or agency or any employee

finance the costs of assisting in the establishment of business and/or
industries, to include the cost of financing facilities to be owned or used by
the businesses and/or industries. The excise tax shall be made available and
expended for the above purposes for no consideration other than the economic
benefit to be provided to the citizens of the city by establishment of the
facilities and/or by the creation or retention of the jobs, as will be further
specified in agreements to be negotiated. Proceeds of the excise tax shall be
administered by the Durant Industrial Authority, provided no proceeds of the
excise tax shall be committed or expended without the prior consent and
approval by the City Council. None of the excise tax proceeds shall be used to
pay administrative costs or salaries of the Durant Industrial Authority or the

businesses and/or industries that shall pay their employees one and one-half
times the federally-mandated minimum wage, and allow the entity a period of
five years or less to attain the wage rate for its workforce. Any change of
this provision shall require a two-thirds majority vote of the Durant

(meter stop) in the meter box without written permission from the Utility
Department.
   (F)   No person shall interfere with or bypass the city’s meter in such a
manner as to obtain water without the full amount being registered on such
meter. Upon discovery, the city shall disconnect the water supply. Such account
shall be reconnected only at the discretion of the city and only after payment
for water used, as estimated by the city at twice the rate otherwise
applicable, plus the cost of rerouting and repairing the service to register
accurate water use through the meter.
   (G)   Access to a water meter shall not be obstructed in any manner or
means, including access to the premises made dangerous by placement of a
vicious animal, vehicle, obstacle, or obstruction, thereby preventing a meter
reader from obtaining a meter reading. In the event of obstruction, the water
use charges shall be estimated in an amount not to exceed double the average
amount of the previous year. If the customer fails to remedy the condition or
refuses to pay the estimated bill, the city shall have the right to discontinue
water service without further notice and service shall not be restored until
the obstructive causing the termination of water supply has been remedied and
all charges for water service are paid.
   (H)   Dual connections (more than one user on a single meter) to avoid
sanitary sewer charges are prohibited. Dual connections must be approved in
advance by the City Utility Department.

(Prior Code, § 53.026) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.038 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLANS.
   The IPD shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an
accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. For industrial users identified as significant prior to November
14, 2005, this evaluation must have been conducted at least once by October 14,
2006; additional significant industrial users must be evaluated within one year
of being designated a significant industrial user. For purposes of this
section, a SLUG DISCHARGE is any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature,
including but not limited to an accidental spill or a non-customary batch
discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause interference or pass
through, or in any other way violate the POTW’s regulations, local limits, or
permit conditions. The results of such activities shall be available to the
approval authority upon request. Significant industrial users are required to
notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential
for a slug discharge. The IPD may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be
necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the IPD may develop such a
plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at
a minimum, the following:
   (A)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
   (B)   Description of stored chemicals;
   (C)   Procedures for immediately notifying the IPD of any accidental or slug
discharge, as required by §
53.100 of this chapter; and
   (D)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures, and equipment for emergency
response.

designated by the IPD, and at such times as are established by the IPD. Such
waste shall not violate §§
53.015 through
53.022 of this chapter or any other requirements established by the city. The
IPD may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits or general permits.
   (B)   The IPD shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits or general permits. The IPD may require generators
of hauled industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or
general permits. The IPD also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial
waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other
requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the IPD. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the
IPD. The IPD may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with
applicable standards. The IPD may require the industrial waste hauler to
provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
   (D)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every
load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

§ 53.040 INTERCEPTORS/TRAPS.
   (A)   Grease and oil interceptors are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid biodegradable emulsified oil and grease. Excessive amounts of
biodegradable oil and grease are harmful to the drainage system, the public
sewer, and the sewage treatment process. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the IPD, they are necessary for the
proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil,
or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential
users.
      (1)   All interceptors and grease traps shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the IPD, and include a sampling point downstream of the trap and
shall be capable of producing an effluent free of oil and grease in
concentration of 200 mg/l or less.
      (2)   All interceptors and grease traps shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
      (3)   Where installed, all grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned, and repaired at regular intervals, as needed, by the user
at his or her expense.
      (4)   Where installed, all grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be
continuously maintained and operated in an efficient manner by the owner, at
his or her expense, at all times.
      (5)   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.
They shall be of substantial construction, water-tight, and equipped with
easily removable covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gas-tight and
water-tight.
      (6)   The use of hot water, chemicals, other agents, or devices for the
purpose of causing the oil, grease, or sand to pass through the interceptor,
separator, and/or pretreatment facility so provided is hereby prohibited unless
authorized by the IPD prior to discharge.
      (7)   All requests for the use of additives as grease maintenance will be
reviewed and handled on a case-by-case basis. The decision to allow a
requesting establishment to use additives for grease maintenance lies solely
upon the IPD or other enforcement officers as designated by the city.
      (8)   Any establishment required to install an interceptor who fails to
properly operate and maintain the interceptor will be considered to be in
violation of this chapter.

§ 53.060 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; GENERAL PERMITS.
   (A)   At the discretion of the IPD, the IPD may use general permits to
control SIU discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All
facilities to be covered by a general permit must:
      (1)   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
      (2)   Discharge the same types of wastes;
      (3)   Require the same effluent limitations;
      (4)   Require the same or similar monitoring; and
      (5)   In the opinion of the IPD, are more appropriately controlled under
a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge permits.
   (B)   To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a written
request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production
processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all
wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in accordance with §
53.098(B) of this chapter for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, and any other information
the POTW deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present
nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general
permit until after the IPD has provided written notice to the SIU that such a
waiver request has been granted in accordance with §
53.098(B) of this chapter.
   (C)   The IPD will retain a copy of the general permit, documentation to
support the POTW’s determination that a specific SIU meets the criteria in §
53.061(A)(1) to (A)(1)(5) of this subchapter and applicable state regulations,
and a copy of all written request for coverage for three years after the
expiration of the general permit.
   (D)   The IPD may not control an SIU through a general permit where the
facility is subject to production-based categorical pretreatment standards or
categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged
per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the combined wastestream formula
or net/gross calculations.
   (E)   Coverage by general control mechanism does not relieve industrial
users of reporting requirements.
(Prior Code, § 53.039) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.061 APPLICATION SIGNATORIES AND CERTIFICATIONS.
   (A)   All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports, and
certification statements must be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and contain the certification statement in §
53.108(A) of this chapter.
   (B)   If the designation of an authorized representative is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new written authorization satisfying the
requirements of this section must be submitted to the IPD prior to or together
with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
   (C)   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial
user by the IPD must annually submit the signed certification statement in §
53.108(B) of this chapter.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
§ 53.095 BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS.
   (A)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
POTW shall submit to the IPD a report which contains the information listed in
division (B) below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge,
new sources and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to
the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the EPD
a report which contains the information listed in division (B) below. A new
source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet
applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
   (B)   Users described above shall submit to the city IPD information set
forth below.
      (1)   General information. All information required in §

(B).
         (c)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where
an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with
40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the control authority.
         (d)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with §
53.104 of this subchapter;
         (e)   The IPD may allow the submission of a baseline report which
utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures.
         (f)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date, and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
      (3)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user’s
authorized representative as defined in §
53.004 of this chapter and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements;
      (4)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date
in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for
the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this
section must meet the requirements set out in §
53.096 of this subchapter; and
      (5)   Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be certified in accordance with §
53.108(A) of this subchapter and signed by an authorized representative as
defined in §
53.004 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 53.065) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.096 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE PROGRESS REPORTS.
   The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by
§
53.095(B)(4) of this subchapter.
   (A)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation).
   (B)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months.
   (C)   The user shall submit a progress report to the IPD no later than 14
days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken
by the user to return to the established schedule.
   (D)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports to the IPD.
(Prior Code, § 53.066) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.097 REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD DEADLINE.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the IPD a
report containing the information described in §§
53.059(A)(6) and (A)(7) and
53.095(B)(2) of this chapter. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R.
§ 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
53.108(A) of this subchapter. All sampling will be done in accordance with §
53.105 of this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 53.067) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.098 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by
the IPD but in no case less than once per six-month period, on dates specified,
submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the IPD or the pretreatment standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the user.
   (B)   The city IPD may authorize eligible industrial users subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the
following conditions.
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit. See §
53.059(A)(8) of this chapter.
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
53.004 of this chapter, and include the certification statement in §
53.108(A) of this subchapter (40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 C.F.R. Part
136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the IPD must be included as a
condition in the user’s permit. Documentation supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the IPD for three years after expiration of the waiver.
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s
permit by the IPD, the industrial user must certify on each report with the
statement in §
53.108(C) of this subchapter, that there has been no increase in the pollutant
in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user.
      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user’s operations,
the user must immediately notify the IPD and comply with the monitoring
requirements of §
53.098(A) of this subchapter, or other more frequent monitoring requirements
imposed by the IPD.
      (9)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (C)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
53.108(A) of this subchapter.
   (D)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (E)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the IPD, using the procedures prescribed in §
53.105 of this subchapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report.

conditions.
(Prior Code, § 53.069) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.100 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load or slug discharge, that may cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the IPD of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   (1)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, if
required by the IPD, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s)
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences.
      (2)   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability, which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   (1)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of
a discharge described in division (A) above.
      (2)   Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a
discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the IPD of any
changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
(Prior Code, § 53.070) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.101 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the IPD as the IPD may
require.
(Prior Code, § 53.071) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.102 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the IPD within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the IPD within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by
the industrial user is not required if the IPD performs the sampling at the
user’s facility at least once a month, or if the IPD performs sampling at the
user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when
the user or the IPD receives the results of the sampling, or if the IPD has
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. If the IPD
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city
will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of
the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and
analysis.
(Prior Code, § 53.072) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.103 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
53.099 of this subchapter. The notification requirement in this section does
not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
53.095,
53.097, and
53.098 of this subchapter.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42
U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq., identifying additional characteristics of hazardous
waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must
notify the Pretreatment Coordinator, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of
such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Prior Code, § 53.073) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.104 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and
amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must
be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(Prior Code, § 53.074) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.105 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period. The monitoring frequency necessary to
assess and assure compliance by the user with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements shall be indicated in the user’s control mechanism issued by
the IPD.
   (A)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection
techniques unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the IPD. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the IPD, the samples must be representative of the
discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented
in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the IPD, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques as specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
53.095 and
53.097 of this subchapter, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the IPD may authorize a lower
minimum. For the reports required by §
53.098 (40 C.F.R. §§ 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (D)   When 24-hour composite sampling is required, the composite sample must
be taken within a 24-hour period, however this period only covers the period
during which the industrial user is discharging.
(Prior Code, § 53.075) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.106 DATE OF RECEIPT OF REPORTS.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Prior Code, § 53.076) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.107 RECORDKEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with best management practices established under §
53.018(C) of this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact place, method,
and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the
dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall
be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the IPD.

(Prior Code, § 53.100) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 53.165 IN GENERAL.
   The following administrative enforcement remedies may be utilized when any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement has been violated.
(Prior Code, § 53.104) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.166 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the IPD may serve upon that user a written notice of violation.
The IPD may require the industrial user to submit a written explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof,
within a time frame specified by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the IPD to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of
violation.
(Prior Code, § 53.105) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.167 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The IPD may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible
for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by
the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
53.169 and
53.170 of this subchapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Prior Code, § 53.106) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.168 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The IPD may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the IPD and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested). Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 53.107) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.169 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the IPD may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 53.108) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.170 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the IPD
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 53.109) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.171 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a
general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the IPD may fine such user in the amount of not more than
$1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the
case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 45 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 1.5% of the unpaid balance, and interest
shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A lien against the user’s
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the IPD to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 15 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
IPD may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The IPD may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, § 53.110) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.172 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The IPD may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The IPD may
also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the IPD
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The IPD may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the IPD that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in §
53.173 of this subchapter are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the IPD prior to the date of any show cause
or termination hearing under §§
53.168 or
53.173 of this subchapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Prior Code, § 53.111) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.173 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
53.081 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual or general wastewater discharge permit
conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
53.015 through
53.022 of this chapter.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
53.168 of this subchapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the IPD shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.

violations.
(Prior Code, § 53.139) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.221 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An UPSET does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the IPD within
24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally,
a written submission must be provided within five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; or
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Prior Code, § 53.140) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.222 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
53.015(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §§
53.015(B)(3) through (B)(7) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its OPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Prior Code, § 53.141) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.223 BYPASS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user’s treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   Allowing to occur. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) below.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the IPD, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the IPD of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The IPD may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report
has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the IPD may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) above.
      (2)   The IPD may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the IPD determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in division (D)(1) above.
(Prior Code, § 53.142) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
FEES
§ 53.235 IN GENERAL.

(Prior Code, § 53.150) (Ord. 1590, passed 4-14-2009)
§ 53.237 SURCHARGES.
   (A)   Surcharges will be administered for the discharge of excessive
strength BOD5, TSS, and FOG when the limits stated in this chapter are
exceeded. These charges are in addition to any sewer use charges incurred by
the user and shall be according to the fee schedule.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, EXCESSIVE STRENGTH WASTEWATER
means wastewater discharged into the POTW in which the average concentrations
of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) exceeds 225 mg/l, and/or the average
concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) exceeds 200 mg/l, and/or the
average concentration of fats, oils, and grease (FOG) exceeds 200 mg/l.
      (2)   In order to recover the costs of treating excessive strength
wastewater, the city reserves the right to apply a surcharge to any user
identified as discharging excessive strength wastewater. Surcharges shall be
calculated on the basis of mass (measured in pounds) in accordance with the
following formula:
 
P    = (C - X) x MG x 8.34
Where:
P    = Pounds of pollutant applicable to surcharge
C    = Concentration of pollutant in mg/l measured in the discharge
X    = Allowable concentration of pollutant in mg/l
MG   = Total flow in million gallons discharged during the reporting period
8.34 = Conversion factor
 
      (3)   There will be no surcharge, nor will there be any reduction in the
base level charge, when C is equal to or less than the concentration limits for
each respective pollutant.
      (4)   If only one sample is collected during the reporting period, any
surcharge fee that is applicable to said sample shall apply to the total flow
discharged in the reporting period both before and after the sample is
collected.
      (5)   If more than one sample is collected during the reporting period,
the first sample surcharge is calculated by using the total flow discharged
from the first day of the reporting period until the date of the second sample.
The second sample surcharge is calculated using the remaining days in the
reporting period. Subsequent sample surcharges shall be calculated in the same
manner using the total flow discharged until the date of subsequent sample
collection.
   (B)   The sewage from individual residences known to discharge only domestic
wastewater is assumed to be of normal strength and will not ordinarily be
analyzed.

§ 70.075 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting the
word “go,” “caution,” or “stop,” or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used, and the terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “go.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or
turn right or left unless a sign or barricade at such place prohibits either
such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or “stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or “stop”
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
sufficient time to cross the roadway and any pedestrian then starting to cross
shall yield right-of-way to all vehicles.
   (C)   Steady red alone or “stop.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before
entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until green or “go” is
shown alone. However, vehicles in the right traffic lane after making a stop as
above required may enter the intersection cautiously and make a right turn
unless “no turn on red” signs are posted to prohibit right turns; but such
vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian or other traffic in the
intersection, and such turn shall not be made so as to interfere with traffic
proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or “go” is shown alone or until authorized so to do by a pedestrian
“walk” signal.
   (D)   Steady red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or “go” is shown alone or until authorized so to do by pedestrian “walk”
signal.
      (3)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made. In the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers
of all vehicles.

nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, than before entering the intersection. The right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   (B)   This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings.

      (1)   When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers or operators of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past
such signal only with caution.

crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, then before
passing the signal or entering the intersection, and shall remain standing
until flashing yellow is shown alone.
      (2)   Pedestrians may proceed across the road controlled by the signal
and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.

about to be shown and shall not enter the signal-controlled roadway or
intersection, or in a direction which conflicts with the movement of vehicular
traffic, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her crossing
shall proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island and shall be given the
right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.

weight of alcohol in the person’s blood is relevant evidence of operating a
motor vehicle while his or her ability to operate such motor vehicle is
impaired by the consumption of alcohol or intoxicating liquor. No person shall
be convicted of the offense of operating a motor vehicle while his or her
ability to operate such vehicle is impaired by consumption of alcohol or
intoxicating liquor solely because there was more than 0.05% by weight of
alcohol in the person’s blood in the absence of additional evidence that such
person’s driving was affected by the consumption of alcohol to the extent that
the public health and safety was threatened or that the person had violated a
state statute or local ordinance in the operation of a motor vehicle;
      (3)   Evidence that there was 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol in his
or her blood shall be admitted as prima facie evidence that the person was
under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating liquor;
      (4)   Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams
of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood; and
      (5)   To be admissible, such evidence must first be qualified by
establishing that such specimen was obtained from the subject within not more
than two hours of the arrest of the subject.
   (F)   Every person who is convicted of a violation of this section for
operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating liquor
shall be punished as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.

§ 95.16 DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS, UNSECURED BUILDINGS, AND ABATEMENT.
   In addition to procedures outlined in this code, the City Council may cause
dilapidated buildings within the city limits to be torn down and removed, or
boarded or secured, in accordance with the following procedure.
   (A)   At least ten days’ notice shall be given to the owner of the property
before the city takes action or holds a hearing as provided herein. A copy of
the notice shall be posted on the property to be affected. In addition, a copy
of the notice shall be sent by mail to the property owner at the address shown
by the current year’s tax rolls in the office of the County Treasurer. Written
notice shall also be mailed to any mortgage holder as shown by the records in
the office of the County Clerk to the last-known address of the mortgagee. At
the time of mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage holder, the
city shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt
shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee.
However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be located,
notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property, or by
publication, as defined by 11 O.S. § 1-102. The notice may be published once
not less than ten days prior to any hearing or action to be taken pursuant to
this section.
   (B)   The owner of the property may give his or her written consent to the
city authorizing the removal, tearing down, dismantling, or the boarding and
securing of a building and to the payment of any costs incurred thereby. By
giving the written consent, the owner waives his or her right to a hearing by
the City Council.
   (C)   If the property owner does not give his or her written consent to such
actions, a hearing shall be held by the City Council to determine whether the
property is dilapidated and has thereby become detrimental to the health,
benefit, and welfare of the public and the community or creates a fire hazard
to the danger of property or needs to be boarded and secured.
   (D)   Pursuant to a finding that the condition of the property constitutes a
detriment or a hazard and that the property would be benefitted by the removal
of such conditions or by its boarding and securing, the City Council may cause
the dilapidated building to be torn down and removed, or boarded and secured,
and shall fix reasonable dates for the commencement and completion of the work.
The City Clerk shall immediately file a notice of dilapidation or unsecured
building and lien with the County Clerk describing the property, the findings
of the city at the hearing, and stating that the city claims a lien on the
property for the destruction and removal, boarding, and securing costs, and
that such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and
after the date of filing of the notice. The hearing may be held in conjunction
with a hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass on
the premises of the building held pursuant to this chapter. In making a
determination to board and secure a building, the Council may order the
boarding and securing when the boarding and securing would make such building
less available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such
building, or decrease the hazard that such building would constitute an
attractive nuisance to children. The agents of the city are granted the right
of entry on the property for the performance of the necessary duties as a
governmental function of the city if the work is not performed by the property
owner within dates fixed by the Council.
   (E)   The Council shall determine the actual cost of the dismantling and
removal of dilapidated buildings, or the boarding and securing, and any other
expenses as may be necessary in conjunction therewith, including the cost of
notice and mailing. The City Clerk shall forward a statement of such actual
cost attributable to the dismantling and removal or boarding and securing and a
demand for payment by mail to the property owner at the address specified in
this section. In addition, a copy of the statement shall be mailed to any
mortgage holder at the address specified in this section. At the time of
mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner or mortgage holder, the
city shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt
shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. If
the city dismantles or removes any dilapidated buildings, or boards or secures
a building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of
the labor, maintenance, and equipment required for the dismantling and removal
of the dilapidated buildings. If dismantling and removal of the dilapidated
buildings or boarding and securing is done on a private contract basis, the
contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder.
   (F)   When payment is made to the city for costs incurred, the city shall
file a release of lien or part thereof. But if payment is not made within six
months from the date of the mailing of the statement, the City Clerk shall
forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the County Treasurer
of the county in which the property is located. Upon receiving payment, the
City Clerk shall forward to the County Treasurer a notice of such payment and
shall direct discharge of the lien or part thereof.
   (G)   The city may designate an administrative officer or administrative
body to carry out the duties of the Council specified in this section. The
property owner shall have a right of appeal to the Council from any order of
the administrative officer or administrative body. The appeal shall be filed in
writing with the City Clerk within ten days after the administrative order is
rendered.
   (H)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property zoned
and used for agricultural purposes.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from otherwise abating
a dilapidated building as a nuisance or otherwise exercising its police power
to protect the public health, safety, or welfare.
   (J)   The officers, employees, or agents of the city shall not be liable for
any damages or loss of property due to the removal of dilapidated buildings
performed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or as otherwise prescribed
by law.
   (K)   If the City Council anticipates the need to board and secure a
building as provided in this section, the notice shall state that any
subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six-month
period after the initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant to such
notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the city; that the costs of such
boarding and securing shall be assessed against the owner; and that a lien may
be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without further prior
notice to the property owner or mortgage holder.
   (L)   If City Council causes a structure within the city limits to be
boarded and secured, any subsequent need for boarding and securing within a
six-month period constitutes a public nuisance and may be summarily boarded and
secured without further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder.
At the time of each such summary boarding and securing, the city shall notify
the property owner and mortgage holder of the boarding and securing and the
costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request an
appeal with the City Clerk within ten days after the mailing of the notice. The
notice and hearing shall be as provided for in this section. Unless otherwise
determined at the hearing, the cost of such boarding and securing shall be
determined and collected as provided for in this section.
   (M)   The City Council may determine that a building is unsecured and order
that such building be boarded and secured in the manner provided for in this
section even though such building has not been declared by the Council to be
dilapidated.

      (4)   The owner of the property may give his or her written consent to

(Prior Code, § 95.60) (Ord. 1848, passed 3-13-2018)
§ 95.61 SUMMARY ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of one or
more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances
may be such as to justify and even to require the City Manager or other
appropriate officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and
proper action summarily to abate such nuisances or to reduce or suspend the
danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   (B)   The Chief of the Fire Department, the Chief of Police, the City
Attorney, the Building Inspector, the Electrical Inspector, the Plumbing
Inspector, or any other officer subordinate to the City Manager may submit
through or with the consent of the City Manager to the City Council a statement
as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or
law and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The City Manager, the
Health Officer, any Council member or any resident or residents of the city may
submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the City Council.
   (C)   The Council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a
nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the
Council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers, and
other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the
Council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner
of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible
for or to be causing the nuisance and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if
such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. The notice to the owner
and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by
a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names or
addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of
the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly
jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published
in a paper of general circulation within the city.
   (D)   If the Council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
it within the specified time, the Council shall direct the City Manager to
abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as
authorized by 50 O.S. § 16. The City Clerk shall send a statement of the cost
of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or
causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names
and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the
city collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.
(Prior Code, § 95.61)
§ 95.62 ABATEMENT BY SUIT IN DISTRICT COURT.
   In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance, the
city may bring suit in the district court of the county where the nuisance is
located, as provided in 50 O.S. § 17.
(Prior Code, § 95.62)
§ 95.63 NUISANCE UNLAWFUL.
   It is unlawful for any person, including but not limited to any owner,
lessee, or other person, to create or maintain a nuisance within the city or to
permit a nuisance to remain on premises under his or her control within the
city.
(Prior Code, § 95.63) Penalty, see §
95.99
§ 95.64 HEALTH NUISANCES; ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 O.S. § 1-1011, the Health Officer
shall have authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises in
the city to remove from such premises, at his or her own expense, any source of
filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the breeding of insects or
rodents that might contribute to the transmission of disease, or any other
condition adversely affecting the public health within 24 hours or within such
other time as may be reasonable, and a failure to do so shall constitute an
offense. The order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the
owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the Health
Officer or by a police officer, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual
place of abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state.
If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or
agent is unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a
copy thereof on the premises or by publication in at least one issue of a
newspaper having a general circulation in the city.
   (B)   If the order is not complied with, the Health Officer may cause the
order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified
to the City Clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be
added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if
he or she is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility
service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it
is added and shall become due and payable and be subject to the same
regulations relating to delinquency in payment as the utility bill itself. If
such owner or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost,
after certification to the City Clerk, may be collected in any manner in which
any other debt due the city may be collected.

city shall, within 48 hours after receipt thereof, excluding Saturdays, Sundays
and legal holidays, unless otherwise agreed to between the excavator and the

addition to which the violator of this chapter shall be subject to a fine as

CHAPTER 98: CEMETERIES
Section
   
98.01   Abandoned cemetery lots
§ 98.01 ABANDONED CEMETERY LOTS.
   (A)   All abandoned lots or parts of lots located in any city-owned
cemeteries shall revert to the city. An ABANDONED LOT is defined as a lot or
any part thereof that has not been used or has not been conveyed in the records
of the City Clerk for a period of 50 years.
   (B)   Before any lot or portion thereof shall be deemed to have been
abandoned and to have reverted to the city, the following procedure must be
followed.
      (1)   Notice to deed holder. A notice shall be prepared naming the last
known cemetery lot deed holder, describing the particular cemetery lot it is
alleged has been abandoned, and stating that unless the deed holder, their
successors, or assigns, presents the deed or other appropriate evidence of
ownership to the office of the City Manager, within 45 days from the date of
the first publication of the notice in a newspaper of general circulation
within the city, that the cemetery lot or portion thereof will be deemed to be
abandoned and the title to the lot will revert to the city free and clear of
any claims, right, or title of the deed holder. Said notice will be published
in its entirety three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation
within the city. In addition, the notice will be mailed to the last known
address (if known) of the deed holder.
      (2)   Determination of abandonment; sale or conveyance. After the 45
days’ prescribed notice has expired, the City Council will then determine if
the lot or portion thereof is to be deemed abandoned. If so, the city’s
cemetery records will be amended to reflect that the lot has been abandoned and
the title vested in the city. The city will then have the right to sell or
convey the lot or portion thereof to a new deed holder who will take title
possession free and clear of any right of the previous deed holder or their
heirs, assigns, or successors.
      (3)   Options of lot owners. In the event that a person presents
sufficient evidence to show they are the rightful owner of the cemetery lot or
part thereof that is in question, they shall have the right to have the records
of the City Clerk updated to reflect that they are the current owner of said
lot or parts thereof. Alternatively, if the rightful owner does not desire to
use said cemetery lot or part thereof, they may elect to sell their lot(s) in a
private transaction or donate the lot(s) back to the city. This provision shall
not require the city to buy back any cemetery lots or parts thereof if the city
does not choose to do so.

Department are applicable to any and all properties in the city, no matter the
property/land use, when significant improvements or renovations occur.
   (B)   While no certificate of compliance is required for marijuana growing
facilities for personal medical use, the city adopts the following regulations
for said facilities.
      (1)   All homegrown medical marijuana plants shall be grown so that the
marijuana is not accessible to a member of the general public and is only
accessible to the patient or caregiver. If grown outdoors, it must be grown
behind a sight-proof fence that is at least six feet in height. The marijuana
plants must be completely enclosed by the fence and the fence must be secured
with a proper lock and key.
      (2)   Growing marijuana shall not be visible from the public right-of-
way.
      (3)   The growing area including any lighting, plumbing, or electrical
components used shall comply with municipal building and fire codes. The
growing area must be properly ventilated so as not to create humidity, mold, or
other related problems. Lighting and any use of generators and gas products
(CO2, butane, and the like) in the growing area shall be properly controlled.
      (4)   Growing marijuana shall not be conducted in a manner that
constitutes a public nuisance. A public nuisance may be deemed to exist if
growing marijuana produces light, glare, heat, noise, odor, or vibration that
is detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare, or interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of life and property.
      (5)   The primary use of the residential property in which marijuana is
grown for personal use shall remain at all times a residence, with legal and
functioning cooking, eating, sleeping, sanitation/ bathing facilities, working
water and electric services, with proper ingress and egress. No room shall be
used for growing marijuana where such cultivation will impair or prevent the
life, safety, and general welfare of the residents.

   It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation, hereinafter designated
as “person,” either as principal agent or employee, to operate within the
corporate limits of the city any taxicab or to act as driver or chauffeur
thereof without complying with the provisions of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 112.01) Penalty, see §
10.99
Statutory reference:
   Taxi licensing; city authority, see 11 O.S. §§ 22-106 and 22-118
   Taxicab defined, see 47 O.S. § 1-174
§ 112.02 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   TAXICAB, TAXI or CAB. A motor vehicle for hire designed to carry ten persons
or less, operated upon any street or on call or demand, accepting or soliciting
passengers indiscriminately for transportation for hire between such points
along streets or highways as may be directed by the passenger or passengers so
being transported, and equipped with a taximeter, for compensation fixed by a
taximeter. A taxicab is not a motor vehicle which operates over fixed routes
within the corporate limits.
   TAXIMETER. A mechanical and or electronic device attached to a taxicab,
which calculates the authorized charge on the basis of distance traveled,
waiting time, or a combination of both which reflects the rates previously
submitted to the city. Charges shall be indicated upon such device in dollars
and cents. A TAXIMETER may not be an internet based application. Rideshare
vehicles or enterprises operating or dispatched via internet based applications
shall not be construed as taxicabs under this section.
(Prior Code, § 112.02) (Ord. O-2022-03, passed 1-11-2022)
§ 112.03 PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; FEE.
   Before any person shall operate a taxicab within the corporate limits of the
city, he or she shall first make application for and obtain a permit to operate
a taxicab. The application shall be made in writing to the City Clerk upon
forms provided by the City Clerk. If the application for a permit is approved,
the City Clerk shall issue to the applicant a permit to operate a taxicab
within the corporate limits of the city upon payment of the sum per vehicle as
set by the Council by motion or resolution to the City Clerk.
(Prior Code, § 112.03) (Ord. O-2022-03, passed 1-11-2022)
§ 112.04 LIMIT ON NUMBER OF PERMITS.
   Each permit shall be effective for a period of one year from the date it was
issued.
(Prior Code, § 112.04) (Ord. O-2022-03, passed 1-11-2022)
§ 112.05 PERMIT TO SHOW.
   The permit when issued to the applicant shall show:
   (A)   Number of the permit;
   (B)   To whom the permit is issued;
   (C)   Date of expiration of the permit; and
   (D)   The telephone number of the permit holder.
(Prior Code, § 112.05)
§ 112.06 PERMIT TRANSFERS.
   In order to transfer a permit, the assignor must execute an assignment
thereof on the back of the original permit and present the same to the City
Manager. The City Manager shall then either accept or reject the assignment.
Upon approval, the City Clerk shall then cancel the valid permit and issue a
new one to the assignee, which new permit shall expire at the same date as the
old one, and the City Clerk shall charge and collect, before issuing the new
permit, a fee as set by the Council by motion or resolution.
(Prior Code, § 112.06) (Ord. O-2022-03, passed 1-11-2022)
§ 112.07 MUST DISPLAY PERMIT.
   The permits to operate a taxicab are transferrable from one motor vehicle to
another. No motor vehicle shall be operated as a taxicab unless a permit is
displayed in the motor vehicle and the provisions of §
112.05 of this chapter are fully complied with.
(Prior Code, § 112.07) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 112.08 PERMIT TO FURNISH CERTAIN INFORMATION.
   (A)   A person holding a permit or permits to operate a taxicab or taxicabs
within the corporate limits of the city shall furnish the City Clerk with a
list of all the motor vehicles that he or she intends to operate as taxicabs.
The list shall show the following information with regard to each motor
vehicle:
      (1)   Motor number of motor vehicle;
      (2)   State taxicab license number;
      (3)   Model number of motor vehicle; and
      (4)   Color of the motor vehicle.
   (B)   Any changes made in the number of the motor vehicles shall be reported
to the City Clerk. Any motor vehicle not properly listed shall not be used as a
taxicab until it has been properly listed with the City Clerk as provided in
this section.
(Prior Code, § 112.08)
§ 112.09 CERTIFICATES OF INSPECTION.
   Permits are issued upon the condition that the city reserves unto itself
acting through its City Manager or police the right to inspect at any time any
taxicab or taxicab stand for the purpose of determining if the taxicabs and
taxi stands are being operated in compliance with this chapter. On or before
January 15, April 15, and October 15 of each year, the Chief of Police of the
city shall notify each person holding a permit or permits to operate a taxicab
to report at a designated place for the purpose of having each motor vehicle
used as a taxicab inspected. When the motor vehicle has been inspected and its
mechanical condition approved by the Chief of Police, or officer designated by
the Chief of Police to inspect the motor vehicles, a certificate of inspection
shall be displayed on the windshield of the motor vehicle showing that it has
been inspected and is in proper mechanical condition for use as a taxicab.
(Prior Code, § 112.09)
§ 112.10 TAXICABS TO BE IDENTIFIED.

§ 112.11 SCHEDULE OF RATES TO BE DISPLAYED.
   Every person engaged in the business of operating a taxicab shall exhibit,
by attaching to the vehicle in a conspicuous place on the inside thereof, a
card setting forth the schedule of rates, with the number of the driver’s
license on the bottom and attaching a photograph of the driver to the schedule
with his or her name attached to the photograph.
(Prior Code, § 112.11)
§ 112.12 DRIVERS AND OPERATORS TO HAVE LICENSE; FEE.
   (A)   Every person who shall drive or operate any taxicab for wages or hire
in the service of a permit holder shall first obtain a license therefor. No
license shall be issued until an application shall have been made in writing
accompanied by a certificate of character and the certificate shall enumerate
the following:
      (1)   Occupation and employment pursued over the next preceding five-year
period;
      (2)   Whether or not the applicant has had any collision or accident in
which any person or property was injured or damaged and description of the
same, in each case;
      (3)   Whether or not the applicant has ever been charged with or
convicted of any crime, and if so, the nature of the crime;
      (4)   Whether or not the applicant has ever had a driver’s or other
license revoked or canceled and for what purpose;
      (5)   Whether or not the applicant drinks any intoxicating liquors or has
been under the influence of the same within the past year;
      (6)   Whether or not the applicant has been convicted of violating any

   (B)   The application and certificate of character shall be examined by an
examining board, composed of the City Manager, Chief of Police, and City Clerk.
If the applicant is found to be competent to serve as a driver or chauffeur and
that the representations made in the certificate relating to other matters are
answered to the satisfaction of the examining board, the City Clerk shall issue
to the applicant a driver’s license upon the payment of $1.25 by the applicant
to the City Clerk, which driver’s license shall expire on June 30 following the
date of issue. The driver’s license shall be carried on the person of the
driver and upon request by any police officer of the city, the license shall be
exhibited to the officer. Should the application be rejected or disapproved by
the examining board, then the applicant shall have the right of appealing to
the City Council by filing with the City Clerk within three days after such
rejection or disapproval a notice in writing that he or she is appealing to the
City Council, which appeal shall then be heard by the City Council at its next
regular meeting and the findings of the City Council shall be final.
(Prior Code, § 112.12)
§ 112.13 INSURANCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Each and every person owning and operating a vehicle as a taxicab
shall take out and maintain, during the time such vehicle or vehicles shall be
operated as a taxicab, public liability and property damage insurance as shall
protect him or her while operating the vehicle or vehicles from claims arising
out of damages to persons or property, including bodily injury and death as a
result of the operation of the vehicle or vehicles.
   (B)   The insurance shall be in the form of a standard public liability
policy and shall be in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 for injury,
including accidental death, to any one person, and a like amount for each
person for a total of not less than $2,000,000 for any one accident by way of
personal injury and for property damage of not less than $500,000 for any one
accident, which policy shall be filed with the City Clerk and shall be a
condition and a prerequisite of the obtaining of a valid permit.
   (C)   A like amount of insurance shall be carried for each vehicle operated
as a taxicab.
(Prior Code, § 112.13) (Ord. O-2022-03, passed 1-11-2022)
§ 112.14 PERMITS AND LICENSES MAY BE REVOKED.
   All permits and licenses are issued on the condition that the same may be
revoked at any time by the Mayor of the city for committing any of the offenses
hereinafter specifically mentioned, the permits and licenses to be revoked for
the period of time set opposite the offense.
   (A)   For violating any laws of the state commonly known as the
Nonintoxicating Beverage, Alcoholic Beverage Act, being 37A O.S. §§ 1-101 et
seq., and/or Narcotic Act, being 63 O.S. §§ 420 et seq., by any taxicab driver,
taxi stand operator, or employee while on duty or the permitting of any
violation of the laws on any taxi stand premises or in any taxicab. The permit
holder shall, insofar as this provision of the ordinance is concerned, be
responsible and accountable for the acts of his or her drivers and employees,
while on duty, and therefore any violation by the driver or employee shall be
grounds for revocation of the permits. Any violation of the laws by a driver,
in addition to the other penalties herein designated, shall be grounds for
suspending or revoking the driver’s license for a period of not less than 30
days. A conviction of any violation of the laws in a state court of record
shall be prima facie proof of the violation of the laws. The permit shall be
revoked for six months after a first offense and completely revoked after the
second offense.
   (B)   The operation of a taxicab or taxi stand by a person other than the
one to whom the permit was issued and his or her employees and licensed drivers
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter for which the permit shall be
revoked. It is the intention of the City Council that only the permit holder
shall be authorized to conduct the taxicab business and any operation of the
business through a “straw man” shall be deemed an attempt to circumvent this
chapter punishable by revocation of all permits by the person held. It is the
intention of the Council that the permit holder shall himself or herself
actively manage and conduct the business for which the permit is issued.
   (C)   For wrongfully using the permit in a taxicab not having proper license
tags or motor vehicle not properly listed with City Clerk, the permit shall be
revoked for a period of 30 days.
   (D)   To use the permit in motor vehicle operated by an unlicensed driver or
chauffeur, the permit shall be revoked for a period of 30 days.
   (E)   For failure to renew the permit on or before the expiration date
thereon shall be grounds for the cancellation of the same and a refusal to
issue a new permit.
   (F)   For failure to display permit while operating a taxicab, the permit
shall be suspended for 30 days.
   (G)   For violation of the transfer ordinance of the city while driving a
taxicab, the permit shall be suspended not to exceed 30 days.
(Prior Code, § 112.14)
§ 112.15 MAYOR TO NOTIFY VIOLATOR; HEARING TO BE HELD; RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   (A)   Upon accusation having been made that a permit holder of licenses has
violated any of the provisions of this chapter, the City Manager or his or her
designee shall notify the offender, orally or in writing, and hearing shall be
set down upon reasonable notice. Hearing shall be held by the City Manager or
his or her designee. For the purpose of the hearing, the City Manager or his or
her designee is herewith authorized to compel them to produce any books or
records by them maintained in conjunction with the business by them operated,
and a failure to comply with such orders shall of and in itself be grounds for
revocation of the permits or licenses, as the case may be.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the ruling of the City Manager or his or her
designee shall have a right to appeal to the City Council by filing a written
notice with the City Clerk within ten days from the ruling of the City Manager
or his or her designee of his or her intention to do so. Upon an appeal having
thus been lodged, the Council shall, at its next regular Council meeting, hear
the matter de novo and shall enter such order or orders as are just and proper.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 113.001 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   In order to protect the health, peace, safety, and welfare of the city and
its residents, these regulations are promulgated to establish reasonable and
uniform limitations, safeguards, and controls for the drilling, operation and
production, storing, transportation, and pipeline transmission of oil, gas, and
other hydrocarbon substances within the corporate limits of this city and
provide that this land use may be conducted in harmony with other uses within

§ 113.002 AUTHORITY.
   These oil and gas well regulations are ratified by ordinance of the city in
accordance with the provisions in 11 O.S. §§ 45-101 through 45-104.
(Prior Code, § 113.002) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 113.003 VALIDITY.
   If any section, clause, division, provision, or portion of these regulations
shall be held invalid, or unconstitutional, by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause,
division, provision, or portion of these regulations.
(Prior Code, § 113.003) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 113.004 ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND AMENDMENT.
   (A)   The City Manager or his or her designee shall employ or contract an
inspector, and assistants, if necessary, whose duty it shall be to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Inspector shall have the authority to issue any orders or
directives required to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter and its
particular provisions. Failure of any person to comply with any such order or
directive shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   (C)   The Inspector shall have authority to enter and inspect any premises

Director from reporting any possible state or federal violations that are
either observed or otherwise reported to the appropriate regulating authority.
(Prior Code, § 113.004) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 113.005 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      ABANDONED WELL.
         (a)   Any oil, gas, disposal, injection or other service well, or any
seismic, core, or other exploratory hole, whether cased or uncased, the owner
and operator shall be jointly and severally liable and responsible for the
plugging thereof in accordance with these rules.
         (b)   Each well in which production casing has been run, but which has
not been in operation for one year, shall be properly plugged immediately. For
new wells in which surface casing has been properly set and cemented to protect
the fresh water, the well shall be plugged within 30 days after cessation of
drilling or testing. In the case of other newly drilled wells, without surface
casing and in which drilling and testing operations have ceased, immediate
plugging is required before abandonment. For the purposes of this rule, a shut-
in gas well shall be considered a producing well and in operation, and
therefore exempt from the plugging requirements herein.
      ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. The raising to the surface of the earth by means
other than natural flow of petroleum or natural gas.
      BOOSTER PUMP. A centrifugal or piston pump used to increase the volume or
pressure on a gathering line.
      BUILDING. Any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any
use or occupancy. The term BUILDING shall be construed as if followed by the
words “or portions thereof.”
      COMPRESSOR STATION. A single or series of compressor pumps for the
artificial production or flow (volume and pressure) of more than one producing
oil or gas well.
      COMPRESSOR UNIT. A single compressor pump used to serve a single

are in good working order and drilling or working over the well shall cease if
any of the preventers is inoperative. Preventer types and numbers must be
determined by the blowout risk factors.
   (B)   Subsurface safety values and shutdown devices are preferred, but
surface valves and shutdown devices can be considered if risk analysis
indicates they are appropriate.
(Prior Code, § 113.063) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 113.069 USE OF SEPARATORS.
   Separators shall be used at each well to adequately care for the output of
the well, or both oil and gas without spraying oil through the separator vent
lines. No gas shall be produced, wasted, or allowed to escape through a
separator vent line at any time when the noise caused by such wasting,
producing, or escaping of gas shall be audible for a distance of 300 feet or
more from the well. When it shall appear that an explosive mixture of gas may
be accumulating near the ground, the Inspector may require that the well be
shut down until the gas is dissipated. All separators shall be vented either
separately or through a manifold into a vent. Such vent shall not be less than
two feet in diameter. It shall not be closer than 65 feet to the well hole,
centerline of street, or the lease boundary. No separator shall be used which
has less than 125 pounds working pressure; provided, that all separators on
which a pressure of greater than 125 pounds per square inch shall be carried
shall be tested by the hydrostatic method to at least one and one-half times of
the working pressure to be carried on such separator.
(Prior Code, § 113.064) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 113.070 SECURING VENT LINES.
   All vent lines shall be fastened with at least three steel guy lines to each

§ 113.071 IMPROVEMENT OF SITE AFTER DRILLING COMPLETED.
   Upon completion of the well or completion of construction of any location,
all contaminated soil shall be physically removed from the area and the area
restored to its normal condition insofar as possible. On all locations, all
lines, including flow lines, gas lines, water lines, and electric lines, shall
be buried and maintained at a minimum depth of 24 inches. All lines carrying
corrosive materials shall be plastic-coated internally and shall be coated
externally if required by soil conditions. The material shall be of sufficient
quality to serve the property for the life of the well, tank batteries, booster
pumps, compressor stations, or pipelines.
(Prior Code, § 113.066) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 113.072 OPERATOR TO CERTIFY SETTING OF WELL.
   The operator shall certify by written affidavit that the well has been set
according to good engineering practices. Such affidavit shall stipulate the
number of sacks of cement, the class of cement, blended materials, weight of
cement in pounds per gallon, cement displacement pressure, and final pumping
pressure. Certification shall also stipulate whether check valves (float shoes,
float collar) held the pressure. Beginning and ending times of the operation
shall be stipulated. The form shall be completed by a cementing service
company, signed by both the operator and the cementing service operator.
(Prior Code, § 113.067) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 113.073 EARTHEN PITS AND DIKES.
   (A)   Oil and gas wells may use slush pits constructed to prevent pollution
of the surrounding land surfaces. Within six months after any oil and gas well
within the limits of the city shall have been completed for production of oil
and/or gas, or within six months after the same shall have been completed in
cases where the same is abandoned for the reason that a dry hole is found, the
slush pit shall have any deleterious substances removed and be filled with dirt
and leveled off.
   (B)   All earthen pits shall be above the 100-year floodplain or properly
diked above the 100-year floodplain with a dike which is sufficient to repel
floodwater. Prior to the commencement of any drilling operation, an artificial
barrier shall be constructed completely around the well site no closer than 50
feet from the well bore. The top of the artificial portion of the barrier to be
constructed down drainage from the well shall be level at all points at a
height of no less than two feet above the ground level at the well bore in
order that any deleterious matter from the well would be trapped and stored
before such matter can enter the drainage off the well site. An adequate
diversion ditch or dike shall be constructed across and around the uphill edge
of the well site so that no surface drainage water can enter the area of the
well location.
   (C)   Any valve in the barrier shalt be kept closed at all times. Any fluid
trapped within the well site shall be pumped into steel tanks for storage and
removal. The gate in the barrier may be temporarily opened under supervised
conditions for rainwater drainage, and then only if it can be demonstrated that
such rainwater has not been contaminated with oil, chemicals, salt, or any
other deleterious substances.
   (D)   Reserve pits shall be constructed. As an alternative, drilling mud
operations may be conducted in steel tanks and the barrier which shall be
removed from the property immediately upon completion of the well.
(Prior Code, § 113.068) (Ord. 1583, passed 1-8-2008)

   (A)   The storage of crude oil shall be outside buildings in aboveground
tanks. The well bore or tanks must be set no nearer than 50 feet from non-
fireproof buildings or from outside property lines; provided, however, that an
application in writing may be made to the City Manager or his or her designee
and, when approved by him or her and the City Council, setting the tanks at a
nearer distance may be allowed. Such distance may be increased at the
discretion of the City Council after consideration of special features such as
topographical conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity to buildings or
adjoining property, and height and character of construction of such buildings,
capacity and construction of proposed tanks, and degree of public fire
protection in the vicinity.
   (B)   All crude oil tanks shall be painted within 90 days after well
completion and kept in proper painted condition after installation and have
conspicuously upon their sides in red letters at least six inches high the
wording “flammable keep away” and “no smoking” and with any other appropriate
warnings, for example “warning/dangerous hydrogen sulfide.”
   (C)   Metal or fiberglass tanks shall be so constructed as to have a factor
of safety of at least 2.5 for working pressure or dynamic pressure.
   (D)   All tanks shall have roofs or tops and the openings of tanks shall be
fully protected. They shall be firmly and securely jointed to the tanks and all
joints in both sides and top shall be gastight and free from leakage as nearly
as possible and lockable.
   (E)   Tanks which are more than one foot above ground shall have foundations
and supports of noncombustible material and shall not be permitted under or
within ten feet of any aboveground outside storage tanks.
   (F)   At each well, a total capacity of an aboveground battery of crude oil
storage tanks shall be limited to 2,000 barrels utilizing low-profile tanks and
each tank shall have the capacity not to exceed 500 barrels. An oil and gas
permit is required for a location for tank batteries separate from a well
location. The maximum storage allowed will be 5,000 barrels utilizing low-
profile tanks and each tank shall have a capacity not to exceed 500 barrels.
   (G)   All tanks shall be provided with a pressure vacuum vent system
sufficient to adequately dispense excess gas from the tanks. Vent openings may
be made removable, but shall be kept firmly attached. The covers for manholes,
handholes, and gauge holes shall be made tight fitting and lockable.

§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE; METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has
in (statutes) 82 O.S. §§ 1601 through 1618, as amended, Chapter 23 delegated
the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city does ordain as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter uses the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter it’s most reasonable application. For the purpose of this
chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.

flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the START OF CONSTRUCTION commenced on or after the effective date of
an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the START OF CONSTRUCTION
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation
adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. (For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), being 16
U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq.), includes substantial improvement and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual START
OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of  restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before START OF CONSTRUCTION of the
improvement. This includes structures that have incurred SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a HISTORIC STRUCTURE provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a HISTORIC
STRUCTURE.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A VARIANCE,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements, see 44 C.F.R. § 60.6 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), or (d)(3) is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.
(Prior Code, § 151.02) (Ord. 1622, passed 8-11-2009)
§ 151.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. The chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled, “The Flood Insurance Study for
Bryan County, Oklahoma and Incorporated Areas” dated June 2, 2011, with
accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM) are hereby adopted on June 2, 2011
by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
   (C)   Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered,
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (G)   Warning and disclaimer or liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions,
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by human-
made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the city or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.

and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data
available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the
provisions of §
151.05 of this chapter;
      (9)   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the city’s
Floodplain Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zones A and AE on the County FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city;
      (10)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations, the city may approve certain
development in Zones A or AE on the community’s FIRM which increases the water
surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the
city first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (conditional
letter of map revision);
      (11)   Become accredited by the Board in accordance with 82 O.S. §§ 1601
through 1618, as amended; and
      (12)   After a disaster or other type of damage occurrence to structures
in the city, determine if the residential and non-residential structures and
manufactured homes have been substantially damaged and enforce the substantial
improvement requirement.
   (C)   Permit procedures. 
      (1)   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her and may include, but
not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
         (a)   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
         (b)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;
         (c)   A certificate from a registered professional engineer or
architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the
floodproofing criteria of §
151.05(B)(2) of this chapter;
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and
         (e)   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
division (B)(1) above.
      (2)   Approval or denial of a development permit by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (b)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (c)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (d)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (e)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (f)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems;
         (g)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         (h)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (i)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         (j)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
for that area; and
         (k)   Compensatory storage as to the expected heights, velocity,
duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters within a
floodway, floodplain, or any other location that may have expected flood
waters.
   (D)   Variances.
      (1)   General provisions.
         (a)   The Floodplain Board may grant variances for uses which do not
satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or these
regulations, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that
compliance with these regulations will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable
taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people; and
satisfies the pertinent provisions of this division (D). However, provided no
variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit
the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
         (b)   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the state.
         (c)   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
20 years.
         (d)   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the
city, accompanied by a filing fee.
         (e)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in division (C)(2) above and
provisions of division (D) below have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         (f)   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the
base flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Floodplain
Administrator which states that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to
be built lower than the base flood elevation; and such construction below the
base flood level increases risks to life and property.
         (g)   At such time as the Floodplain Administrator deems the petition
ready for notification to the public, the Floodplain Administrator shall
schedule a hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county and a newspaper of general
circulation in the county at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
         (h)   The Floodplain Administrator shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this division
(D). The Floodplain Administrator shall exercise wide discretion in weighing
the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and
to the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
         (i)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations, or
ordinances; and
            4.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         (j)   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this division (D)
and the intent of these regulations, the Floodplain Administrator may attach
such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further
the purposes and objectives stated in §
151.01(C) of this chapter.
         (k)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance issued by the city shall be sent by the Floodplain Administrator to
the OWRB and FEMA within 15 days after issuance of the variance.
      (2)   Special provisions.
         (a)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation,
or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of these regulations.
         (b)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         (c)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         (d)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
            1.   The criteria of divisions (D)(1)(e), (D)(1)(i), (D)(2)(b), and
(D)(2)(c) above are met; and
            2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.

§ 151.05 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the
following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial
improvements.
      (1)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      (4)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
      (5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in §§
151.03(B),
151.03(C)(3), or
151.03(B)(8) above, the following provisions are required.
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) and shall be elevated a minimum of two-foot above the base flood
elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor
shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard
of this division as proposed in §
151.04(C)(1) above, is satisfied.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) shall be elevated a
minimum of two-foot above the base flood level. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this division as proposed in §
151.04(C)(2) above, is satisfied.
      (3)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement, and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters.
      (4)   Manufactured homes.
         (a)   Require that all manufactured homes allowed to be placed within
the city in its Zone A or AE areas as shown on the County FIRM shall be
installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the
purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated so that the
bottom of the I-Beam shall be elevated a minimum of two-foot above the base
flood elevation and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
An elevation certificate is required to be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator to verify this requirement has been met.
         (b)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zone AE on the community’s FIRM on sites outside of a
manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the bottom of the I-Beam of the
manufactured home shall be elevated a minimum of two-foot above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. An elevation certificate
is required to be provided to the Floodplain Administrator to verify this
requirement has been met.
      (5)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A and AE on the county FIRM either:
         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         (c)   Meet the permit requirements of §
151.04(C)(1) above, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
“manufactured homes” in division (B)(4) above. A recreational vehicle is ready
for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the
site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
      (6)   Accessory structure.
         (a)   Structure is low valued and represents a minimal investment.
         (b)   Structure shall be small and not exceed 600 square feet in size.
         (c)   Structure shall be unfinished on the interior.
         (d)   Structure can be used only for parking and limited storage.
         (e)   Structure shall not be used for human habitation (including
work, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas).
         (f)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment must
be elevated to or above the BFE or floodproofed.
         (g)   Structure is constructed and placed on building site so as to
offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters.
         (h)   Structure is designed to have low flood damage potential, such
as constructed with flood resistance materials.
         (i)   Structure is firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
         (j)   Floodway requirements must be met in the construction of the
structure.
         (k)   Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be
provided below the BFE.
         (l)   Structure is to be located so as not to cause damage to adjacent
and nearby structures.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with §
151.01(B), (C), and (D) of this chapter.
      (2)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of §§
151.03(C) and
151.04(C) of this chapter; and the provisions of this section.
      (3)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five
acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to §§
151.03(B) or §
151.04(B)(8) of this chapter.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize
or eliminate flood damage.
   (D)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
151.03(B) of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply.
      (1)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If division (C)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
      (3)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Ch. 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the
adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood
elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM
and floodway revision through FEMA.
(Prior Code, § 151.05) (Ord. 1622, passed 8-11-2009)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances. Any person who violates or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be punished as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy
any violation.

§ 152.23 DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the following standards is to provide the
Municipal Planning Commission and the City Council with standards to guide
their review of the design elements in a proposed development plan for a new
manufactured housing development.
   (B)   General design standards. The development plan for a manufactured
housing (land-lease) development shall be studied to determine whether the
proposed site development plan meets the requirements of this chapter and the
following:
      (1)   Each site development plan should be laid out and developed as a
complete unit, in accordance with an integrated overall design;
      (2)   The location for buildings, parking areas, walks, lighting, and
appurtenant facilities should be arranged to be compatible with surrounding
land uses. Any part of the site not used for buildings, other structures,
parking, roads, accessways, or recreation purposes should be landscaped with
grass, trees, and/or shrubs;
      (3)   There should be sufficient private open space in each lot to ensure
that each resident has an adequate amount of light, air, and privacy;
      (4)   Parking areas should be arranged to be safe and conveniently
accessible from streets internal to the development;
      (5)   The street pattern should serve, not shape, the lots in the
development. Minor streets should feed at well spaced intervals into collector
arterial streets. Streets should intersect at 90 degree angles;
      (6)   A site development plan which conforms to and preserves terrain,
trees, shrubs, and rock formations is highly preferred; and

§ 152.32 STANDARDS FOR DETERMINATION OF EXTERIOR SIMILARITY AND/OR
COMPATIBILITY.
   The following standards shall be used in determinations of similarity and/or
compatibility in appearance between a manufactured home (with foundations
approved as provided in this section) and site-built housing which has been
constructed in adjacent or nearby locations.
   (A)   Minimum width of main body. Minimum width of the main body of the
manufactured home shall not be less than 14 feet, as measured across the
narrowest portion of the house. This is not intended to prohibit the offsetting
of portions of the home.
   (B)   Minimum roof pitch; minimum roof overhang; roofing materials. Minimum
pitch of the main roof shall be not less than three feet of rise for each 12
feet of horizontal run (3:12), and minimum roof overhang shall be one foot. In
cases where site built housing generally has been constructed in adjacent or
nearby locations with lesser roof pitches and/or roof overhangs of less than
one- foot, then a manufactured home may have less roof pitch and overhang,
similar to the site-built houses. Any roofing material other than a built up
composition roof may be used if it is generally used for site-built houses in
adjacent or nearby locations.
   (C)   Exterior finish; light reflection. Only material for exterior finish
which is generally acceptable for site-built housing which has been constructed
in adjacent or nearby locations may be used, provided, however, that reflection
for such exterior shall not be greater than from siding coated with clean white
gloss exterior enamel.
   (D)   Approved foundations required. No manufactured home shall be placed or
occupied for residential use until such foundation plans have been submitted to
and approved by the Building Official/Inspector or his or her designee as to
the appearance and durability of the proposed foundation and being acceptably
similar or compatible in appearance to foundations of residences built on
adjacent or nearby sites. Every manufactured home shall, at a minimum, be
placed on a permanent foundation and have the wheels and other transporting
devices removed prior to such placement. In order to be administratively
approved for installation, a manufactured home must be placed on a continuous
perimeter, permanent foundation wall (stem wall or approved masonry wall) with
concrete footings as indicated in the figure below.
   (E)   Site orientation of the manufactured home. Manufactured homes shall be
placed on lots in such a manner as to be compatible with and reasonably similar
in orientation to the site-built housing which has been constructed in adjacent
or nearby locations.
   (F)   Garages and/or carports. In residential neighborhoods where adjacent
or nearby site-built homes include garages and/or carports, a manufactured home
must have a garage or carport. A manufactured home shall be required to be
provided with a garage and/or carport compatible with the manufactured home and
the site-built garages and/or carports constructed in adjacent or nearby
locations.
   (G)   Compatibility with adjacent or nearby site-built housing. In order for
the Building Official/Inspector or his or her designee to approve a building
permit for the installation of a manufactured home in an existing residential
district, the proposed manufactured home shall be compared to site-built
housing in the neighborhood within the same zoning district. Approval for the
installation of a manufactured home shall not be granted by the Building
Official unless it is found that the subject manufactured home is substantially
similar in size, siding, material, roof pitch, roof material, foundation, and
general appearance to site-built housing which may be permitted by the Zoning
and/or Building Code in the neighborhood in the same zoning district.

§ 153.08 APPLICATION AND PERMIT REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ANTENNA AND ANTENNA SUPPORT
STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Ownership. The applicant for a building permit to construct a
telecommunications tower or antenna must be the owner of the property or his or
her legal agent or possess a signed and legally notarized statement from the
property owner indicating his or her consent. Any leased area must be large
enough to accommodate the tower or antenna and support facilities and include
access to a public street or accessible parking area. Purchase or ownership of
a separate parcel may require platting and improvements before construction
permits can be issued.
   (B)   Site plan. Prior to the issuance of a building permit a site plan
shall be submitted by the applicant to the Building Official in such a manner
as will satisfy all of the following requirements:
      (1)   No antenna support structure or antenna, microwave reflector/
antenna or associated foundations, anchors, or support wires may be located
within any required front, side or rear yard or closer than five feet to any
property line;
      (2)   Access to an antenna support structure and related facilities or
buildings must be through a locked gate with the antenna support structure
equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device;
      (3)   Any antenna support structure and related facilities or buildings
must be similar in color and character to the main or adjoining building or
structure or blend with the landscaping and other surroundings in the immediate
vicinity to the extent practical. The antenna support structure and the related
facilities or buildings shall be enclosed by a screen eight feet in height,
using a chain link or wrought iron fence with an evergreen hedge or a totally
opaque screening fence or a masonry wall. This enclosure shall be paved or
graveled and kept weed-free. Equipment or vehicles not necessary for direct
support of the use shall not be stored or parked on the site unless repairs to
the facility are being made or unless the zoning district permits such a
storage use;
      (4)   The antenna support structure shall be erected and operated in
compliance with current Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation
Administration rules and regulations and other applicable federal and state
standards;
      (5)   A commercially used antenna support structure must be:
         (a)   Used by two or more broadcast/ reception services; or
         (b)   Designed and built so as to be capable of use by two or more
broadcast/reception services while allowing no more than three degrees of twist
and sway at the top elevation. The owner of the antenna support structure must
certify to the city that the antenna is available for use by another broadcast/
reception service on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis at a cost not
exceeding the market value for the use of the facilities, provided space is
available at the time of the request.
      (6)   No lettering, symbols, images, or trademarks large enough to be
legible from any public street shall be placed on or affixed to any part of an
antenna support structure, antenna array, or antenna other than as required by
FCC regulations regarding tower registration or other applicable law. No
commercial advertising, signage, or flag shall be allowed on any antenna
support structure. This shall not prevent the joint use of a legal existing
sign structure in an appropriate zoning district as a support mechanism for an
antenna;
      (7)   The need for the antenna support structure at the proposed site
shall be documented as a part of the site plan, including an assessment of the
existing antenna support structures in the vicinity of the city, noting why
existing structures are unsuitable or unavailable;
      (8)   Antenna support structures should be constructed to minimize
potential safety hazards. Antenna support structures and antennas shall be
constructed so as to meet or exceed the most recent EIA-222 standards. Prior to
issuance of a building permit, the Building Official shall be provided with an
engineer’s certification that the tower’s design meets or exceeds those
standards. All antenna support structures shall be located in such a manner
that if the structure should fall along its longest dimension, it will remain
within property boundaries and avoid residential structures, public streets,
utility lines and any other antenna support structure;
      (9)   Antenna support structures, antennas, and related facilities and
buildings shall be located to minimize their number, height, and obtrusiveness
in order to minimize visual impacts on the surrounding area and in accordance
with the following policies:
         (a)   Ensure that the height of antenna support structures and
antennas has the least visual impact and is no greater than required to achieve
service area requirements and potential collocation;
         (b)   Demonstrate that the selected site for a new antenna support
structure provides the least visual impact on residential areas and the public
rights-of-way. Analyze the potential impacts from other vantage points in the
area to illustrate that the selected site provides the best opportunity to
minimize the visual impact of the proposed facility. The antenna support
structure and antenna should be obscured by vegetation, tree cover, topographic
features, and buildings or other structures to the maximum extent feasible. All
landscaping requirements of the particular zoning district shall be complied
with fully. If security lighting is installed, such light shall be directed
into the site and only triggered by motion detectors. Any related unmanned
equipment building shall not contain more than 750 square feet of gross floor
area and shall not be more than 12 feet in height;
         (c)   Historically significant landscapes shall be protected. The view
of and vistas from architecturally and/or historically significant structures
should not be impaired or diminished by the placement of antenna support
structures or antennas; and
         (d)   The Planning Commission may recommend a variance and the City
Council may grant a variance to a requirement for an antenna support structure
when it is determined that such a variance better accomplishes the policies set
out in this chapter than would a strict application of the requirement. Such
variance, however, shall be no greater than necessary to accomplish the
policies established herein.
      (10)   No signals or lights or illumination shall be permitted on an
antenna support structure unless required by the Federal Communications
Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, or the city;
      (11)   If any additions, changes, or modifications are to be made to the
antenna support structure, the Building Official shall have the authority to
require proof, through the submission of engineering and structural data, that
the addition, change, or modification conforms to structural wind load and all
other requirements of the current building code adopted by the city;
      (12)   To enable the Building Official, Planning Commission, and/or City
Council to access the visual impact of the proposed antenna support structure
and antenna, the applicant shall submit color photo simulations showing the
proposed site with a photo-realistic representation of the proposed structure
as it would appear viewed from the closest residential property or from one-
fourth mile in the direction of the nearest residentially zoned property,
whichever distance is less. The applicant shall also submit photographs of the
same views showing the current appearance of the site, without the proposed
antenna support structure and antenna;
      (13)   The antenna support structure complies with all ordinances of the
city not in conflict with this chapter;
      (14)   Any antenna support structure legally erected prior to January 11,
2000 can be extended upward to accommodate additional antennas so long as the
total height limitation of this chapter is not exceeded and permitting
requirements of this chapter are met;
      (15)   In addition to the usual application fee for a request for a
change in zoning, the applicant shall reimburse the city for the reasonable,
actual cost to the city for the services of an engineer should one be required
to review the application and provide engineering expertise;
      (16)   In order to minimize visual impacts that can result from the
presence of antenna support structures, such structures and associated
facilities may not exceed 200 feet in height. Monopole construction, free of
guy-wire support systems, is encouraged whenever feasible. Compliance with all
requirements of the Building Code, including an engineer’s structural
certification of the antenna support structure, must be demonstrated before a
construction permit can be issued;
      (17)   No commercial antenna support structure shall be located closer
than 200 feet to the boundary line of any property zoned or used for any
residential purpose. All antenna support structures shall observe a minimum
setback from any abutting street right-of-way equal to the combined height of
the support structure and attached antennas. An exception may be granted by the
Building Official or the City Council where engineering documents indicate that
the tower design will assure that a collapsing tower will fall within a smaller
area. Under no circumstances, however, may a freestanding antenna support
structure be located closer than 50 feet from the abutting street right-of-way.
Setbacks from residentially zoned property do not apply to antennas attached to
public utility structures exceeding 75 feet in height or to antennas placed
wholly within a building;
      (18)   To minimize their proliferation, all reasonable efforts should be
made to co-locate facilities on existing or new antenna support structures;
      (19)   An antenna may be placed wholly within any building legally
permitted in a commercial, industrial, or health facilities district or in any
publicly-owned building;
      (20)   An antenna may be mounted flush to the exterior of buildings in a
commercial, industrial, or health facilities zoned district if painted and
integrated into the overall architectural design. An antenna may be attached to
any utility structures (such as a water tower or electrical transmission tower)
or public building not located in a street right-of-way, if the property is
owned by a government or public agency;
      (21)   In the Main Street District, no antenna may extend above the
building on which it is mounted unless it is made to appear as a part of the
building and integrated into the overall architectural design;
      (22)   Except in the Main Street District, a roof-mounted non-whip
antenna may extend ten feet above the building, provided that the antenna and
supporting equipment is fully screened from view at street level;
      (23)   Except in the Main Street District, a whip antenna may be mounted
on the roof of a nonresidential building or structure, provided it does not
exceed the height of the building by more than ten feet and it is located no
closer to the perimeter of the building than its height above the roof;
      (24)   Antenna support structures and antennas of more than ten feet in
height are prohibited within residentially zoned districts. The structures are
allowed by right within the I-1 and I-2 Zoning Districts;
      (25)   Satellite and microwave dishes attached to antenna support
structures shall not exceed four feet in diameter or six feet in diameter if
attached to a lattice tower; or
      (26)   All transmitting antennas, microwave dishes, and related equipment
shall transmit with low wattage transmitters not to exceed 500 watts per
channel.

10.99
§ 153.09 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   An antenna support structure or antenna shall not be constructed or used
within the city without all approvals and permits first having been secured.
The Building Official shall approve or reject the site plan within 30 days of
the zoning application being approved by the City Council. If applicable, or of
the date of submittal of the site plan by applicant, whichever last occurs. In
the event the site plan as originally submitted is incomplete, the 30-day
review period does not commence until the Building Official determines the site
plan, as amended, to be administratively complete.
(Prior Code, § 154.09) (Ord. 1298, passed 1-11-2000)
§ 153.10 ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURES AND ANTENNA MOUNTED ON EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Building-mounted antennas of the non-whip type are allowed on
nonresidential buildings and structures, provided the antenna is mounted flush
with the exterior of the building so that it projects no more than 30 inches
from the surface of the building to which it is attached and the antenna’s
appearance is such as to blend with the surrounding surface of the building.
   (B)   Associated equipment shall be placed either within the same building
or in a separate building which matches the existing building in character and
building materials or blends with the landscaping and other surroundings
immediately adjacent to the separate building housing the equipment. Associated
equipment for roof-mounted antennas may be located on the roof of the building
if it is not visible from the street.
   (C)   Before the Building Official may issue a building permit and at the
time of application for a building permit to locate an antenna support
structure or antenna on an existing building or other structure, the Building
Official shall be provided with color photo simulations showing the site of the
existing structure with a photo-realistic representation of both the proposed
support structure and the existing structure or any proposed reconstruction of
the structure as it would appear viewed from the closest residential property
or from a distance of one-fourth mile in the direction of the nearest
residentially zoned property, whichever distance is less. The applicant shall
also submit photographs of the same views showing the current appearance of the
site without the proposed construction.
   (D)   Before the Building Official may issue a building permit and at the
time of application for a building permit to locate an antenna support
structure or antenna on an existing building or other structure, the Building
Official shall be provided with an engineer certification that the roof and/or
other support structure will support the proposed antenna and all associated
equipment.

§ 154.03 AIRPORT ZONES.
   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and
conical surfaces as they apply to Eaker Field. Such zones are shown on the
Airport Airspace Drawings, sheets 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, prepared by Barnard
Dunkelberg and Company and dated August 1999, which are hereby expressly
incorporated herein and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one of
the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitation.
   (B)   The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows.
      (1)   Runway larger than utility visual approach zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet
at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center
line is the continuation of the center line of the runway (runway 12-30).
      (2)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as
three-fourths mile non-precision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000
feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet
at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center
line is the continuation of the center line of the runway (runway 17).
      (3)   Precision instrument runway approach zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at
a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center line
is the continuation of the center line of the runway (runway 35 planned).
      (4)   Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces.
      (5)   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual and
10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface
of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to
those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional
zones.
      (6)   Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
(Prior Code, § 155.03) (Ord. passed 10-21-1974; Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-2004)
§ 154.04 AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be
erected, altered, or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any
zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height
limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are
hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows.
      (1)   Runway larger than utility visual approach zone. Slopes 20 feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet
along the extended runway center line (runway 12-30).
      (2)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as
three-fourths mile non-precision instrument approach zone. Slopes 34 feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet
along the extended runway center line (runway 17).
      (3)   Precision instrument runway approach zone. Slopes 50 feet outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway center line; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each
foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the
extended runway center line (runway 35 planned).
      (4)   Transitional zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 848 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the
precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90
degree angles to the extended runway center line.
      (5)   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation or at a height of 848 feet above mean sea level.
      (6)   Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the
construction or maintenance of any structure or growth of any tree to a height
up to 50 feet above the surface of the land.
(Prior Code, § 155.04) (Ord. passed 10-21-1974; Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-2004)
§ 154.05 USE RESTRICTION.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger, or interfere with
the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
(Prior Code, § 155.05) (Ord. passed 10-21-1974; Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-2004)
§ 154.06 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of November 9, 2004 or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a
nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to November 9, 2004, and is diligently
prosecuted.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city.
(Prior Code, § 155.06) (Ord. passed 10-21-1974; Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-2004)
§ 154.07 PERMITS AND FEES.
   (A)   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in divisions (A)(1), (A)
(2), and (B)(3) below, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been
applied for and granted upon the prior payment of the appropriate permit fees
to be established from time to time. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use,
structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such
determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for
a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless
a variance has been approved in accordance with division (D) below.
      (1)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain,
land contour, or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above
the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      (2)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
      (3)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when
such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition
zones.
      (4)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration
of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter except as set forth in §
154.04 of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
November 9, 2004 or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application
for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit
shall be granted.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not be an airport
hazard or create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and
will be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, the Board

property owner may petition the Planning Commission and the City Council to
extend or reinstate the approval. Such petition shall be considered for
recommendation at a public meeting of the Planning Commission and shall be
considered at the City Council.
   (B)   In determining whether to grant such requests, the Planning Commission
and the City Council shall take into account the reasons for the lapse, the
ability of the property owner to comply with any conditions attached to the
original approval, and the extent to which newly adopted subdivision
regulations shall apply to the plat. The Planning Commission and the City
Council shall extend or reinstate the plat, or deny the request, in which
instance the properly owner must submit a new application for approval.
   (C)   The Planning Commission and the City Council may extend or reinstate
the approval subject to additional conditions based upon newly enacted
regulations or such as are necessary to assure compliance with the original
conditions of approval. The Planning Commission and the City Council may also
specify a shorter time for lapse of the extended or reinstated plat than is
applicable to original approvals.
   (D)   The approval of a preliminary plat for a portion or phase of a sketch
plat, or the approval of a final plat for a portion or phase of a preliminary
plat, shall not automatically affect the expiration of approval of the sketch
plat or preliminary plat as it pertains to the balance of the property.
Extensions and reinstatement of a sketch plat, preliminary plat, or final plat
may be approved under the provisions of this section.

§ 155.028 AMENDMENTS TO SKETCH PLAT OR PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   At any time following the approval of a sketch plat or preliminary
plat, and before the lapse of such approval, a property owner may request an
amendment. The rerouting of streets, addition or deletion of alleys, or
addition or deletion of more than 10% of the approved number of lots shall be
considered a major amendment. The adjustment of street and alley alignments,
lengths, and paving details; the addition or deletion of lots within 10% of the
approved number and the adjustment of lot lines shall be considered minor
amendments.
   (B)   The City Council shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove
after recommendation from the Planning Commission any proposed amendment and
may make any modifications in the terms and conditions of preliminary plat
approval reasonably related to the proposed amendment. This shall occur at a
public meeting in accordance with the same requirements for the approval of a
sketch plat or preliminary plat.
   (C)   If the applicant is unwilling to accept the proposed amendment under
the terms and conditions required by the Planning Commission and the City
Council, the applicant may withdraw the proposed amendment.

PLATTING PROCEDURES
§ 155.040 GENERAL.
   (A)   Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, before any contract is
made for the sale of any part of the land, the owner of the land shall apply
for and secure a recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval of the
City Council of such proposed subdivision. The proposed subdivision may be
processed as a standard subdivision as follows: Standard subdivision:
      (1)   Sketch plat;
      (2)   Preliminary plat (and construction plans for improvements);
      (3)   Final plat;
      (4)   Building permits may be issued by the Community Development
Director only after the preliminary plat has been approved by the Planning
Commission and City Council; and
      (5)   Certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Community Development
Director only after the structure(s) comply with the requirements of the
International Residential Code and/or the International Building Code and a
preliminary plat has been approved by the Planning Commission and City Council.
   (B)   Upon initial receipt of a subdivision proposal, the Community
Development Director shall determine if the proposal shall be classified as a
major or minor subdivision or a re-plat. The Community Development Director
shall determine what information, drawings and procedure will be necessary for
the submission of the subdivision to the Planning Commission as well as to the
City Council in accordance with these regulations and the policies of the
Planning Commission and of the City Council The Community Development Director,
shall consider in each case the nature of a proposed subdivision and the
relationship of the proposal to surrounding land uses, topography, property
shape, property size, adjacent ownership, public access and public facilities
in order to determine the extent to which the platting process must be
followed. The above determinations of the Community Development Director may be
reviewed and revised by the Planning Commission, and then the City Council upon
request of the subdivider.
(Prior Code, § 156.040) (Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-2007; Ord. 1671, passed 11-14-
2011; Ord. O-2021-20, passed 8-10-2021)
§ 155.041 CLASSIFICATION OF SUBDIVISIONS AND ADDITION AS MINOR OR MAJOR.
   (A)   Before any land is platted, the property owner shall apply for and
secure approval of the proposed subdivision plat or addition plat in accordance
with the following procedures, unless otherwise provided by these regulations.
Subdivisions are classified as major or minor depending on the number of lots
proposed and the extent of public improvements required.
      (1)   Minor subdivisions shall create no more than four lots and do not
require the creation of a new street or the extension of municipal facilities.
Minor subdivisions may be approved for residential and nonresidential
properties. Conveyance plats may be approved under the procedure for minor
subdivisions provided that they establish no more than four lots and do not
create a new street or extend municipal facilities. Minor plat approval
requires the submission of a final plat as described under these regulations,
or the submission of a conveyance plat as described under these regulations.
      (2)   Major subdivisions involve the creation of new streets, the
extension of municipal facilities, or the creation of more than four lots.
Major subdivisions may be approved for residential and nonresidential
properties. Conveyance plats are considered major subdivisions if they create
more than four lots or involve the creation of new streets or the extension of
municipal facilities. The procedure for approving a major plat typically
requires three steps: sketch plat, preliminary plat, and final plat. Sketch
plats require recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval by the
City Council. The sketch plat requirement may be omitted if the subdivision
creates no more than one new street and the Community Development Director
determines that sufficient information exist to begin preparation of a
preliminary plat. A concept plan or preliminary site plan that contains
sufficient information to provide for the proper coordination of the
development may be required for nonresidential property.
   (B)   Except as otherwise permitted, the preliminary plat shall have a
recommendation from the Planning Commission and approval by City Council and
the approval of a preliminary plat is required prior to the construction of
public improvements to the property. The preliminary plat and the associated
engineering plans for the property may be amended during construction, with
only major changes requiring reapproval by the City Council after
recommendation of the Planning Commission. Major changes shall include
amendments to any infrastructure that is expected to be adopted by the city or
will impact infrastructure that is already adopted by the city.
   (C)   Upon completion of the required public improvements, or the provision
of a subdivision improvement agreement described in these regulations, the
owner may submit a corrected final plat for the subdivision. Lots may be sold
and building permits obtained after recommendation of the Planning Commission
and approval of the plat by the City Council, and filing of the signed plat.
(Prior Code, § 156.041) (Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-2007; Ord. O-2021-20, passed
8-10-2021)
§ 155.042 SKETCH PLAT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the sketch plat is to provide the subdivider,
the Planning Commission, and the governing bodies an opportunity to identify
any problems concerning the land use, general design, and overall approaches to
installation of improvements before the expenditure of large amounts of money
and manpower in the preparation of more detailed platting documents. This step
in the overall subdivision process is very important because it is at the
initial part of the process when decisions are to be made that can have great
value from the fulfillment of the Comprehensive Plan; or, conversely decisions
wrongly made at this point can be very damaging to the fulfillment of the
Comprehensive Plan. It is important that all of the land to be included in the
proposed subdivision shall be included in the sketch plat so that an overview
of an entire area can be accomplished.
   (B)   Review of regulations. Before preparing the sketch plat, the
subdivider should review these regulations and discuss with the Community
Development Director the procedures for the adoption of a subdivision plat and
the general requirements as to the layout of streets and for any reservations
of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, water supply, fire
protection, the availability of services, and similar matters.
   (C)   Applicability. A sketch plat shall be required as a condition
precedent to approval of any application for a major plat, except where the
Community Development Director determines:
      (1)   The subdivision will result in no more than one new street and
sufficient information exists to begin preparation of a preliminary plat; or
      (2)   A concept plan, preliminary site plan, or final site plan for the
property provides sufficient information for the preparation of a preliminary
plat.
   (D)   Phasing of development. The City Council, after recommendation of the
Planning Commission, may permit a sketch plat for a major plat to be divided
into two or more phases, as indicated on the sketch plat, provided each phase
satisfies the requirements of this chapter. In considering phasing of a sketch
plat, the City Council may approve certain conditions as it deems necessary to
assure the orderly development of the platted land. Such conditions may include
but are not limited to temporary street and alley extensions, temporary cul-de-
sacs, and off-site utility extensions.
   (E)   Application procedure and requirements.
      (1)   Pre-application conference. Before preparing the sketch plat, the
applicant is strongly encouraged to schedule an appointment and meet with the
Community Development Director to discuss the procedures for approval of the
plat and the requirements as to general layout of streets and/or reservations
of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection, and similar
matters, as well as the availability of existing services.
      (2)   General application requirements. Prior to platting of the land,
the property owner shall file an application for approval of a sketch plat with
the Community Development Department. The application and sketch plat shall
meet the following minimum requirements.
         (a)   The application shall include all contiguous holdings of the
property owner with an indication of the portion which is proposed to be
developed or offered, sold, or leased, accompanied by an affidavit of
ownership, which includes an address and telephone number of an agent who shall
be authorized to receive all notices required by these regulations.
         (b)   The study shall be drawn to scale of one inch equals 200 feet or
larger.
         (c)   The lower right-hand corner of the sketch plat shall contain a
title block clearly showing the proposed name of the subdivision or addition,
the name and address of the owner and the engineer or surveyor responsible for
the designer survey, the scale of the drawing, the date the drawing was
prepared, and the legal description of the track.
         (d)   The sketch plat shall clearly show the limits of the tract and
scale distances. True north shall be clearly indicated and shall be to the top
or left of the study.
         (e)   The sketch plat shall show the names of adjacent subdivisions or
additions or the name of record owners of adjoining parcels of unplatted land.
         (f)   The study shall contain the existing zoning on adjoining land,
the location, width, and names of all existing or platted streets or other
public ways within or adjacent to the tract, existing permanent buildings,
railroad rights-of-way, utility and drainage easements, and topography with
existing drainage channels or creeks, and other important features, such as
tree groupings, vegetation, political subdivisions or corporate limits, and
school district boundaries.
         (g)   The study shall show the layout, names, and width of proposed
thoroughfares, collector streets, and intersections, and shall show a general
configuration of proposed streets and alleys.
         (h)   The study shall show a general arrangement of land uses,
including but not limited to park and school sites, municipal facilities,
private open space, floodplains and drainage ways, phasing plan, and proposed
nonresidential and residential uses and densities.
         (i)   The study shall show the location and style of streetlights
within the subdivision.
         (j)   The study shall show the location and dimension of sidewalks
throughout the subdivision.
      (3)   Additional requirements prerequisite to preliminary plat approval.
Except as permitted, prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat, the
applicant shall submit for approval a sketch plat, at a scale of one inch
equals 100 feet or larger, depicting all information required and the following
additional items:
         (a)   The layout, names, and width of proposed streets, alleys, and
easements;
         (b)   Layout, numbers, and approximate dimensions of proposed lots and
all building fines;
         (c)   The location of proposed screening walls and/or other forms of
screening shall be clearly indicated;
         (d)   Existing contours of the tract in intervals of two feet or less,
referred to sea level datum;
         (e)   Existing sewers, water mains, culverts, or other underground
structures within the tract and immediately adjacent thereto with pipe sizes
and locations included;
         (f)   Proposed water, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer pipe lines with
culverts, bridges, and other appurtenances or structures shown;
         (g)   Storm water retention or detention basins as required;
         (h)   Erosion mitigation of lots or roads next to creeks and drainage
ways; and
         (i)   General landscape information.
      (4)   Standards for approval. No sketch plat shall be approved by the
City Council for a plat which is intended for development unless it conforms to
the Comprehensive Plan and the development ordinances of the city.
      (5)   Approval procedure. After review of the sketch plat, the report and
pertinent information as it relates to the plat, and the exhibits submitted at
a scheduled meeting, the Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally
approve, or disapprove the sketch plat. The sketch plat with the recommendation
of the Planning Commission and the Community Development Director will be heard
at a scheduled meeting of the City Council, who shall approve, conditionally
approve or disapprove the sketch plat. One copy of the proposed sketch plat
shall be returned to the owner with the date of approval or disapproval and the
reasons therefor accompanying the copy.
      (6)   Effect of approval. Approval of the sketch plat in conformance to
these procedures by the City Council constitutes authorization by the city for
the property owner to submit application for approval of a preliminary plat
subject to compliance with any conditions attached to approval of the sketch
plat. The approval of any study or plat other than a preliminary plat does not
certify the availability or capacity of infrastructure or that the property is
suitable for development. The determination of infrastructure needs and
capacity and the delineation of floodplain or other limitations on development
will be done only during the review and approval of either a preliminary or
final plat complete with required engineering plans and studies.

8-10-2021)
§ 155.043 PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   The purpose of the preliminary plat is to provide an interim step in
the procedure at which point the subdivider shall present drawings of the
detail features of the subdivision. It is at this point that the items
discussed at the sketch plat stage and as set down herein are prepared in a
form from which determinations can be made as to the technical workability of
the development proposal. If the subdivider is not required to go through the
sketch plat process, the subdivider will be required to have a pre-application
conference with city staff.
   (B)   After the City Council has approved the sketch plat, the subdivider
may proceed with the preparation of the preliminary plat. After the subdivider
has prepared the preliminary plat, he or she may take either of the following
actions:
      (1)   He or she may present the preliminary plat and preliminary plat
checklist to the Planning Commission and the City Council and obtain approval
thereof before proceeding with preparation of the improvement plans; or
      (2)   He or she may present the improvement plans and improvement plans
checklist to the Planning Commission and the City Council at the time the
preliminary plat and preliminary plat checklist are presented.
   (C)   Whenever the subdivider presents to the Planning Commission and the
City Council a preliminary plat and preliminary plat checklist, without
improvement plans, the City Council may conditionally approve the preliminary
plat, subject to Planning Commission approval of the improvement plans within
six months following the preliminary plat conditional approval.
   (D)   After review of the preliminary plat, the Planning Commission shall
give a recommendation and the City Council shall, within 60 days of its
submission, approve, conditionally approve, or reject the plat. The subdivider
shall be notified in writing of this action, together with any conditions of
approval or the reasons for rejection.
   (E)   Whenever the subdivider presents to the Planning Commission and City
Council the preliminary plat, preliminary plat checklist, improvement plans,
and improvement plans checklist and the Planning Commission and the City
Council finds that the plat and improvement plans meet all the requirements of
these regulations, it shall approve the preliminary plat and improvement plans
by placing a certificate of approval upon each copy of the plat and plans. Such
certificate of approval shall bear the signature of the Chairperson and
Secretary of the Planning Commission and Mayor of the City Council and shall
provide that the approval given thereby does not constitute approval for
purposes of recording.
   (F)   Approval of the preliminary plat shall not in all cases entitle the
subdivider to approval of the final plat. Upon preliminary approval, if any
conditions arise which would cause the preliminary plat to become
unsatisfactory due to health, safety, or welfare of the community, the Planning
Commission shall recommend that the final plat be rejected.
   (G)   On forms approved by the city, the applicant shall file for approval
of a preliminary plat, which conforms substantially with the sketch plat (if
required) or alternate plan submitted by the applicant. The plat shall be
prepared by or under the supervision of a registered public surveyor in the
state and shall bear his or her seal, signature, and date on each sheet. The
payment of all applicable fees shall be required at the time of submission.
      (1)   General application requirement. Copies of the proposed preliminary

has been made;
         (d)   The plat conforms to applicable zoning and other regulations;
and
         (e)   The plat meets all other requirements of these regulations.
      (4)   Timing of public improvements.
         (a)   1.   The City Council may require that all public improvements
be installed, offered for dedication, and ready for acceptance by the city
prior to the signing of the final plat.
            2.   The City Council may permit or require the deferral of the
construction of public improvements if in its judgment, deferring the
construction would not result in any harm to the public, or offer significant
advantage in coordinating the site’s development with adjacent properties and
off-site public improvements. Any required public improvement(s) approved for
deferred construction must be provided for as required prior to the approval of
the final plat.
         (b)   If the City Council does not require that all public
improvements be installed, offered for dedication, and accepted by the city
prior to signing of the final plat, it shall require that the applicant execute
an improvement agreement and provide security for the agreement as provided in
those regulations.
         (c)   This procedure shall also apply to the approval of a final plat
if the preliminary plat is omitted.
      (5)   Approval procedure. After review of the preliminary plat, the
report and pertinent information for the Community Development Director
concerning the land study and the application, the report and recommendation of
the City Engineer on the construction plans, and any exhibits submitted at a
public meeting, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes and/or
additions. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation and the City
Council shall approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. One copy of the
proposed preliminary plat shall be returned to the owner with the date of
approval, conditional approval, or disapproval and the reasons therefor
accompanying the plat.
      (6)   Effect of approval. Approval of a preliminary plat by the City
Council constitutes authorization for the City Engineer to release construction
plans subject to his or her final approval and for the City Engineer to
authorize for the property owner to commence grading of the site and
construction of such public improvements as are required by the Planning
Commission and the City Council. Approval of a preliminary plat also authorizes
the property owner, upon fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of
approval, to submit for approval an application for final plat approval. Upon
release of the construction plans, the City Engineer may, upon request of the
applicant, issue a certificate indicating the construction plans have been
released and construction of the improvement is thereafter authorized.
Additional certificates may be issued by the City Engineer authorizing the
construction of private utilities on a phased schedule. The certificate shall
read as follows:
“The preliminary plat for (insert name of the subdivision or addition) as
approved by the City of Durant City Council on (insert date of approval) is
authorized for use with engineering plans for the construction of public
improvements as approved by the City Engineer. A final plat shall be approved
by the City Council and have a recommendation from the Planning Commission upon
the completion of all public improvements or the provision of a subdivision
improvement agreement under the terms of the Subdivision Ordinance and
submission of a final plat in compliance with the Subdivision Ordinance of the
City of Durant.
Zoning regulations that affect exterior appearance of a single-family house or
the landscaping of a single-family lot and that are adopted after approval of a
preliminary plat for a single-family residential development, shall not apply
for a period of two years from the latter of the date of plat approval or the
date of the acceptance of public improvements related to the plat.”
      (7)   Lapse of preliminary plat approval. The approval of a preliminary
plat shall be effective for a period of two years from the date that the
preliminary plat is approved by the City Council, at the end of which time the
applicant must have submitted and received approval for a final plat. If a
final plat is not submitted and approved within two years, or an extension is
not granted in accordance with these regulations, the preliminary plat approval
shall be null and void, and the applicant shall be required to submit a sketch
plat for review subject to the then existing zoning restrictions and
subdivision regulations.
   (H)   Construction plan procedure and requirements:
      (1)   General application requirement. Construction plans shall be
prepared by or under the supervision of a professional engineer or architect
registered in the state as required by state law governing such professions.
Plans submitted for review by the city shall be dated and bear the responsible
engineer’s or architect’s name, serial number, and the designation of
“engineer,” “professional engineer,” or “P.E.” or “architect” and an
appropriate stamp or statement near the engineer’s or architect’s
identification, stating that the documents are for preliminary review and are
not intended for construction. Final plans acceptable to the city shall bear
the seal and signature of the engineer or architect and the date signed on all
sheets of the plans. Public works construction in streets, alleys, or easements
which will be maintained by the city shall be designed by a professional
engineer registered in the state.
      (2)   Construction plan review procedure. Copies of the construction
plans, and the required number of copies of the plat shall be submitted to the
City Engineer for final approval. The plans shall contain all necessary
information for construction of the project, including screening walls and
other special features. All materials specified shall conform to the design
standards of the city. Each sheet of the plans shall contain a title block
including space for the notation of revisions. This space is to be completed
with each revision to the plan sheet and shall clearly note the nature of the
revision and the date the revision was made. The City Engineer will release the
plans for construction, after recommendation of the preliminary plat by the
Planning Commission and approval by the City Council and payment of all
inspection fees. Upon such release, each contractor shall maintain one set of
plans, stamped with city release, on the project at all times during
construction. This procedure shall also apply to approval of a final plat, if a
preliminary plat is omitted.
      (3)   Failure to commence construction. If construction has not commenced
within one year after approval of the plans, resubmittal of plans may be
required by the City Engineer for meeting current standards and engineering
requirements. CONSTRUCTION shall mean installation of city maintained public
improvements.
(Prior Code, § 156.043) (Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-2007; Ord. O-2021-20, passed
8-10-2021)
§ 155.044 FINAL PLAT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the final plat is to create a record document
which accurately describes the subdivided land, both as to accurate dimensions,
and as to legal provisions which are pertinent to the subdivision. Much of the
reason for this step is to make the transfer of the land simpler and certain.
Land sales by reference to a legally filed plat are generally less complicated
and more likely to provide the precise legal situation sought. The certainty of
such sales derives from the assurance of an accurate survey and processes
designed to assure the provision of facilities necessary to service the land.
   (B)   Checklist. At the time the final plat and final plat checklist are
submitted to the Community Development Department, the subdivider shall take
one of the following courses of action.
      (1)   If the subdivider elects to deposit the surety bond as specified in
§
155.026 of this chapter, he or she shall submit plans for all improvements
required under this chapter, such plans to bear the recommendation of the
Planning Commission and approval of the City Council. Upon completion of a
portion of the construction of the required improvements, the City Council may
release a portion of the surety bond in the amount of the costs of the
constructed improvements, as estimated by the City Council, Planning
Commission, Secretary, or municipal staff. Before any portion of the surety
bond may be released, the City Engineer, City Building Inspector, or City
Manager shall approve the as-built plans and specifications for that portion of
the improvements for which the subdivider has requested release of the surety
bond.
      (2)   If the subdivider elects to complete all improvements as specified
in the preliminary plat, he or she shall submit the as-built specifications and
as-built original tracings of all improvements. If the Community Development
Director or his or her designee finds that the as-built plan and specifications
comply with requirements, and that the actual construction is as shown in the
plans and specifications, he or she shall endorse his or her approval thereon.
   (C)   Actions of Planning Commission. All actions of the Planning
Commission, whether recommending approval of final plats for all or part of an
area shown in a preliminary plat shall, insofar as the plat involves
dedications to the public, constitute only an authorization for the subdivider
to submit the plat to the City Council to which the dedications are proposed.
Such Planning Commission actions shall not constitute an acceptance of
dedication or a commitment to accept dedication.
   (D)   Applicability. A final plat shall be required for subdivisions of
property and the recording of single lots in accordance with these regulations.

   (H)   Certificate of compliance. Upon final approval of a final plat
required by these regulations, the Planning Commission and the City Council
shall issue to the person applying for approval a certificate stating that the
final plat has been recommended for approval by the Planning Commission and
approved by the City Council. For purposes of this section, final approval
shall not occur until all conditions of approval have been met.
   (I)   Signing and recording of final plat.
      (1)   When an improvement agreement and security are required, the
Chairperson of the Planning Commission, and the Mayor shall endorse approval on
the final plat after the agreement and security have been recommended for
approval by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council, and all
the conditions pertaining to the final plat have been satisfied.
      (2)   When installation of public improvements is required prior to
recordation of the final plat, the Chairperson of the Planning Commission and
the Mayor shall endorse approval on the final plat after all conditions of
approval have been satisfied and all public improvements satisfactorily
completed. There shall be written evidence that the required public
improvements have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the city as shown
by a certificate signed by the City Engineer stating that the necessary
dedication of public lands and installation of public improvements has been
accomplished.
      (3)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to file the final
plat with the County Clerk. Simultaneously with the filing of the final plat,
the applicant shall record such other agreements of dedication and legal
documents as shall be required to be recorded by the City Attorney. The final

§ 155.045 DEVELOPMENT PLAT.
   (A)   This section applies to the platting and development of any single
parcel greater than five acres or the subdivision and development of any
property into parts, each part being greater than five acres. The term
DEVELOPMENT means the new construction or the enlargement of any exterior
dimension of any building, structure, or improvement. The term IMPROVEMENT
shall include the construction of a utility, road, parking, or drainage system.
The term shall also apply to the grading of land or clearance of trees, except
as may be permitted for valid agricultural use of the property.
   (B)   A development plat must be prepared by a registered professional land
surveyor as a boundary survey showing:
      (1)   Each existing or proposed building, structure, or improvement or
proposed modification of the external configuration of the building, structure,
or improvement;
      (2)   Each easement and right-of-way within or abutting the boundary of
the surveyed property;
      (3)   The dimensions of each street, sidewalk, alley, square, park, or
other part of property intended to be dedicated to public use or for the use of
purchasers or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent to the street, sidewalk,
alley, square, park, or other part; and
      (4)   Any additional information as required by this chapter to apply for
the approval of a plat.
   (C)   The requirements and standards for design, reservation, construction,
completion, maintenance, cost participation, and escrow for public improvements
applying to the approval of a plat shall also apply to a development plat.
   (D)   Development plats shall be processed under the same procedures and are
subject to the same fees as apply to a plat. The procedures for a minor
subdivision may be used when applicable.
   (E)   A development plat shall be approved if it conforms to the following
standards:
      (1)   The general plans, rules, and ordinances of the city concerning its
current and future streets, sidewalks, alleys, parks, playgrounds, and public
utility facilities; and
      (2)   The general plans, rules, and ordinances for the extension of the
city or the extension, improvement, or widening of its roads, streets, and
public highways within the municipality.
   (F)   New development may not begin on the property until the development
plat is filed with and approved by the city. Approved development plats and
other agreements of dedication and legal documents as required shall be
recorded with the County Clerk by the applicant.
(Prior Code, § 156.046) (Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-2007; Ord. O-2021-20, passed
8-10-2021)
§ 155.046 REPLATTING OF LAND.
   (A)   Replat required. Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a
property owner who proposes to replat any portion of an already approved final
plat, other than to amend or vacate the plat, must first obtain approval for
the replat under the same standards and by the same procedures prescribed for
the platting of land by these regulations. The Community Development Director
may waive or modify requirements for a sketch plat under circumstances where
the previously approved sketch plat is sufficient to achieve the purposes set
forth in these regulations. Replats shall include all of the same information
as previously described platting procedures.
   (B)   Replatting without vacating preceding plat. A replat of a final plat
or portion of a final plat may be recorded and is controlling over the
preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the replat:
      (1)   Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being
replatted;
      (2)   Is approved, after a public hearing on the matter at which parties
in interest, and citizens have an opportunity to be heard, by the Planning
Commission and City Council; and
      (3)   Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions
previously incorporated in the final plat.
   (C)   Additional requirements for certain replays.
      (1)   A notice of the public hearing shall be published in an official
paper or a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 15 days prior
to the date of the public hearing. Notice shall be mailed to all owners of
property located within 300 feet of the subject property as provided by a
certified abstractor’s list at the applicant’s cost at least 20 days prior to
the hearing;
      (2)   If the proposed replat requires a variance, and the owners of 20%
or more of the area of lots to whom notice is required to be given under
division (B) above file with the Planning Commission and City Council a written
protest of the replatting before or at the hearing, approval of the replat will
require the affirmative vote of four of the City Council members. In computing
percentages of ownership, each lot is considered equal to all other lots
regardless of size or number of owners, and the owners of each lot are entitled
to cast only one vote per lot. The area of streets and alleys shall be included
in computing the percentage of land area.
      (3)   Any replat which adds or deletes lots must include the original lot
boundaries.

DESIGN STANDARDS; NEIGHBORHOOD FEATURES
§ 155.060 COMMUNITY GENERAL.
   (A)   The quality of the design of the community, both in the urban area and
on the fringes of the urban development, is dependent on the quality of design
of the individual subdivisions in the area. Good community design can be
accomplished by following a few principles. These better approaches to the
layout of new areas. The violation of some of the basic rules concerning design
of streets, ditches and other features can lead to such unpleasant situations
as: streets that deteriorate and are expensive to maintain, street
intersections that are dangerous, drainage ditches that clog up and cause
flooding, building lots that are difficult or expensive to construct upon or
difficulties with erosion during the time of development and even throughout
the life of the homes.
   (B)   The figures which follow show some of the better ways of creating a
subdivision. The use of good design and holding to these methods of development
can provide for the least expense in the building of a subdivision. This is
especially true considering the costs that come to the purchasers of property
that has been improperly developed and the fact that there is no cheaper time
to solve development problems than before houses are built and lots are sold.
   (C)   Figure 1 shows some of the patterns of streets and lots that might be
possible in the development of areas in large, rural estates type lots. In the
shaded area is shown an all too frequent approach to the creating of lots in
rural settings. There are a number of problems from the arrangement of lots in
a road frontage strip as in the shaded area, such as:
      (1)   Long narrow parcels which are of reduced usefulness to the buyer;
      (2)   Increased numbers of driveways intersecting the section line road
(this is a major problem to the county as it tries to keep ditches and culverts
clean and working);
      (3)   The narrower lots result in closer spacing of houses with less
privacy and greater possibility of failure in the operation of individual sewer
systems; and
      (4)   (a)   The frontage of each house upon a section line road means
greater exposure to the dust, traffic, litter and drainage problems which occur
along the major roads (also there is a loss of privacy and the danger that the
road may have to be widened at some time in the future taking part of the front
lawn).
         (b)   On the other hand, some of the other styles of lot arrangements
shown can provide lots of much more usable shape, more privacy, safer traffic,
more workable utility layout, better spacing of buildings and the like.
   (D)   The majority of land developed in the manner shown in Figure 1 is
expected to be in the jurisdiction of the Regional Planning Commission outside
the incorporated area of the city.
   (E)   These are not all of the possibilities for laying out a large lot
development. In fact, a development usually turns out better if it is worked
out to fit the shape of the particular piece of land considering the streams,
hills and the like. However, from this figure it can be seen that almost any
other arrangement is better than a strip of long, narrow lots along the
frontage of a major road.

Notes:   1.   Property dimensions in many cases are shown as less the right-of-
way dimension. This reflects the improvement of the street or road and
dedication of it to the public.
      2.   Covenants should provide for access to lots to be only from side
roads.

Notes:   1.   Minor streets should be designed to provide access in a manner to
discourage use by through traffic.
      2.   Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from
minor streets to major streets.
      3.   Ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided only
on minor streets.
      4.   Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways.
      5.   The urban area shall be designed as a group of integrated
residential neighborhoods with appropriate industrial, commercial, and public
facilities.
      6.   Lots, blocks, and street systems should be designed for the most
advantageous use of topography and natural physical features.
(Prior Code, § 156.060) (Ord. 1041, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 155.061 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   For purposes of this section, the terms ARTERIAL STREETS, SECONDARY
THOROUGHFARES, COMMERCIAL STREETS, COLLECTOR STREETS, and RESIDENTIAL STREETS
shall be defined as indicated in the streets master plan.
   (B)   Sidewalks no less than four feet in width shall be constructed along
properties abutting residential streets, and no less than five feet in width
along properties abutting collector streets, commercial streets, secondary
thoroughfares, and arterial streets.
   (C)   Sidewalks shall be constructed within dedicated streets rights-of-way
along streets improved to city standards. On unimproved streets, covenants
deferring sidewalk construction until street is improved according to city
standards shall be required.
   (D)   Within residential developments, required sidewalks shall be located
adjacent to or within one foot of the property line. Within non-residential
developments, the placement of required sidewalks shall be at the discretion of
the City Council.
   (E)   Sidewalks shall be laid out, graded and otherwise improved as
specified in standards and specifications adopted by the City Council.
   (F)   All sidewalks shall be incorporated into the street improvements
construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
   (G)   Sidewalks and walkways shall be completed at the time the streets are
installed.
   (H)   In order to facilitate access from streets to schools, parks,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation facilities or other community
facilities, the City Council may require pedestrian access ways or crosswalks
not less than five feet wide to be located within perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 20 feet in width. The easements shall be indicated on the
plat.
   (I)   No dwelling unit or business establishment that is required to install
sidewalks shall be occupied until the required sidewalk construction is
completed, inspected and accepted by the city.
(Ord. O-2021-20, passed 8-10-2021)
§ 155.062 STREET LIGHTS.
   (A)   Required new street lighting shall be installed by a franchised
vendor, electric utility or the developer. The street lighting should be shown
on preliminary and final plats. The primary objective for street lighting is
for security and intersection identification.
   (B)   Street lighting shall be chronologically integrated with a development
and shall be installed prior to acceptance of public infrastructure by the
city.
   (C)   Should an easement be required to access power facilities, the
easement should not be less than five feet.
   (D)   The location of the street light shall be as follows and shall serve
as the minimum lighting schedule:
      (1)   One street light at each street or alley intersection.
      (2)   One street light at each end of each cul-de-sac or other
permanently dead ended street.
      (3)   One street light at the approximate midpoint of curvilinear streets
that prohibit visual contact between intersections.
      (4)   One street light located midway between intersections that are
spaced over 600 feet or more apart.
   (E)   The developer may choose to install lighting in addition to the
minimum schedule set forth herein. If lighting is installed in addition to that
maintained by the franchised vendor or electric utility, the developer shall
ensure that a legal entity such as a homeowners association or equivalent is
established and that the entity is assigned the obligation of maintaining the
additional lighting in perpetuity.
(Ord. O-2021-20, passed 8-10-2021)
§ 155.063 STREETS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all
streets shall conform to all of the elements of the general plan and shall be
designed in accordance with the following provisions:
   (A)   Major streets shall be planned to conform with the major streets shown
in the Comprehensive Plan;
   (B)   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the City Council may require service streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a no access reservation along the rear property
line, deep lots, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation from traffic;
   (C)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way of
limited access highway right-of-way, the City Council may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. The following sketch
illustrates both suitable and unsuitable ways of laying out developments
bordering major right-of-way;

except where their control is placed in the city under conditions approved by
the City Council and acceptable to the subdivider;
   (E)   Where the plat to be submitted includes the only part of the tract
owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a
proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion may be required by
the City Council;
   (F)   Where a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical location
and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for
adequate utility easements; and
   (G)   Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
   STREET JOGS LESS THAN 125 FEET SHALL BE AVOIDED

not less than eight feet in width. Streets should be developed in accordance
with the general standards given in the code of the city.
   (J)   (1)   A cul-de-sac should not exceed 500 feet in length, measured from
the entrance to the center of the turnaround unless a dedicated secondary
emergency sealed-surface accessible ingress and egress is provided to the
primary roadway to a point within 500 feet of the center of the turnaround
radius. The ingress and egress shall be, at a minimum, in the form of a 20-foot
wide dedicated public easement that is graded, compacted, sealed-surface, and
otherwise constructed to the city’s specifications.
      (2)   If the cul-de-sac is longer than 150 feet then a turnaround radius
of not less than 65 feet at the property line and 50 feet at the curb line
shall be provided. If there is provided in the center of the turnaround an
unpaved island, it shall be improved with landscaping that will not interfere
with sight distance. The unpaved island shall have a radius of not less than

   (K)    Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, provided that the City Council finds it will
be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half of the street easement
when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent
to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted
within the tract being subdivided;
   (L)   The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no hardship in
the subdividing of adjacent properties. The City Council may require the
dedication of street rights-of-way to facilitate the development of adjoining

      (3)   Street intersections involving major thoroughfares shall have a
minimum street corner radius of 30 feet at the curb line or its equivalent;
      (4)   In order to provide for traffic safety, there shall be on each
corner of each intersection of two streets, a clear sight triangle. A CLEAR
SIGHT TRIANGLE means a triangle formed by the curb lines of two intersecting
rights-of-way and a third line connecting a full view zone of 25 feet from
intersecting corners of the street. On streets with no curb and gutter, the
same triangle will be used and measurements made 12 feet from the center of the
street if the street is two lanes in width and six additional feet for each
lane width as existing at the intersecting corner. The plat or the covenants of
the addition shall clearly prohibit any construction or planting of landscaping
materials in this area.

10-2021)
§ 155.069 DRAINAGE.
   (A)   These regulations and standards are designed, intended and should be
administered in a manner to protect the various drainage areas in the city from
flooding; to provide clean and sanitary channels for runoff; to prevent
pollution of watersheds, streams and natural drainage channels; to prevent the
encroachment of buildings and improvements on natural drainage channels; to
equitably apportion the cost of improvements; to protect natural scenic areas;
and to provide for the conservation of the natural resources of the area and to
fulfill the requirements of the flood insurance administration, The regulations
and standards herein contained shall apply to the incorporated area of the
city. All subdivisions of land and all improvements of any character which
affect drainage in any portion of the city shall be subject to the provisions
of these regulations and be subject to approval by the City Public Works
Director or his or her designee. Development within the limits of the 100-year
flood shall be designed in such a manner that all finished floor elevations
shall be at least one foot above the 100-year floor level; provided, however,
that all earth fills within the 100-year flood level shall be approved by the
City Engineer; and provided, further, that development within the 100-year
flood shall not in any case plan for structures in the floodway as shown on the
official flood maps.
   (B)   (1)   The two classes of drainage channels shall be:
         (a)   Primary drainage channels; and
         (b)    Secondary drainage channels.,
      (2)    In general, it is intended that channels which are designated as
primary channels serve a drainage area of 1,000 acres or more. It is intended
by these regulations that the improvement of primary drainage channels shall be
primarily the responsibility of the community as a whole, since the whole
community is materially benefitted, However, the developer of the land
containing a primary channel is expected to layout, design and otherwise plan
and carry out his or her improvements in a manner that will not interfere with
or restrict the natural flow of water or materially change the condition of
runoff. Increased runoff and changes in primary channels which are created by
improvements of an individual subdivision shall be the responsibility of the
developer of the subdivision and shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of these regulations. It is intended by these regulations that the
improvement of a secondary channel shall be the responsibility of the developer
of the area served by the channel, since the primary benefit is to the area
served by the secondary channel and not to the community as a whole.
   (C)   The maximum condition of rainfall for a 100-year interval plus one-
foot of freeboard shall be used for the purposes of determining all runoff for
the sizing of drainage channels and structures for the city, unless otherwise
specified herein. Values used in formulas for runoff and size of drainage
structures shall reflect the degree of urbanization set forth in the projected
land use pattern contained in the comprehensive plan for the city. The
following formulas and values shall be used for calculating all stream flow and
runoff for the policies and regulations established herein:
      (1)   Runoff from all drainage areas shall be determined by rational
formula:
      Q   =   AIR, in which
      Q   =   Cubic feet per second
      A   =   Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for
areas less than 1,000 acres and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger
areas
      I   =   Percent of imperviousness of the area may vary between 40% and
95%
      R   =   Rate of rainfall over entire drainage area in inches per hour,
based on time of concentration and latest government records for area (using
100-year storm plus one foot for primary and secondary channels)
      (2)   The size of closed storm sewers, open channels, culverts, and
bridges shall be determined using the Manning formula:
      Q   =   1,486 A r 2/3 s 1/2
             n
      Q   =   Discharge in cubic feet per second
      A   =   Cross-sectional area of water in conduit in square feet
      r   =   Hydraulic radius of water in conduit
      s   =   Mean slope of hydraulic gradient, in feet of vertical rise per
foot of horizontal distance
      n   =   Roughness coefficient, based on condition and type of material of
conduit lining, but not less than 0.013
   (D)   All primary drainage channels which are located within, or immediately
adjacent to an improvement or a subdivision shall be protected and improved by
the developer as follows:
      (1)   All land having an elevation below the 50-year maximum flood
elevation and not protected by levies or dikes shall be dedicated to the city
for the purpose of providing drainage and for public park and utility easement
use. The developer may retain unto himself or herself an easement for
landscaping, for installation and maintenance of ornamental elements and for
fencing. Access for proper maintenance to the area of the 100-year flood shall
not be obstructed;
      (2)   The existing channel laying within or immediately adjacent to the
subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the
channel shall be straightened, widened and improved to the extent required to
prevent overflow beyond the limits of the dedicated drainage area;
      (3)   Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building
sites and streets to an elevation where all lots, building areas and streets
will not be subject to overflow and in a manner that will provide for the rapid
runoff of all rainfall;
      (4)   Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, back-sloping,
cribbing and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to control
erosion for all the anticipated conditions of flow for the segment of channel
involved. Planting of appropriate species for landscape beauty is encouraged;
      (5)   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless
it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer; and
      (6)   Culverts, bridges and other drainage structures shall be
constructed in accordance with the specifications of the city at all locations
where drainage channels intersect with continuous streets or alleys.
   (E)   Surface drainage and all secondary channels within or adjacent to the
addition shall meet the following conditions:
      (1)   When a subdivision is traversed by a secondary drainage channel,
watercourse or stream which drains 160 acres or more of land, there shall be
provided a right-of-way for drainage and public parks and public utility
purposes adequate to contain all of the floodway of a 100-year maximum flood.
The right-of-way shall include all of the land within the subdivision that is
within the floodway as established by the official flood maps;
      (2)   Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of
collecting surface water from adjacent properties or intercepting and diverting
side hill drainage shall be provided with an improved open channel;
      (3)   Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of
transporting water through the block or collecting water from cross channels
and which have a drainage area of less than 40 acres shall be improved with
closed storm sewers of an improved open channel when approved by the City
Engineer of the city. Where the secondary drainage channel has a drainage area
of greater than 40 acres, an improved open channel or closed storm sewer shall
be provided;
      (4)   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless
it is placed in a closed storm sewer;
      (5)   Site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface
water from each lot will flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel or
paved street without crossing more than two adjacent lots;
      (6)   Surface water collected on streets shall be diverted to storm
drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent overflow of six-inch high curbs
during a ten- year frequency rain for the area and grades involved. However,
the minimum finished grade at the building line shall be such that it will not
be affected by storms equivalent to a 100-year frequency plus one foot of
freeboard;
      (7)   Drainage area allowed for surface flow on streets at a point of
diversion shall not exceed 20 acres, regardless of flow;
      (8)   Drainage easements of satisfactory width to provide working room
for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all storm sewers;
      (9)   Channel improvements shall be as follows:
         (a)   Open channels shall be improved by providing a paved section
that will carry the runoff from a rain of five-year frequency and a sodded
section to carry the runoff from a rain of ten-year frequency, However, the
minimum finished grade at the building line shall be such that it will not be
affected by storms equivalent to a 100-year frequency plus one foot of
freeboard. The design of the channel improvements shall be in accordance with
the standards set forth on the three following figures. Where turbulence is
sufficiently limited, where natural beauty is thereby preserved and where
erosion will not result, the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve
omitting the paved section; and
         (b)   Whenever an open improved channel is required or authorized for
a secondary drainage channel under the provisions of these regulations and the
channel crosses large residential lots (area of not less than 10,000 square
feet) and the channel improvement is to be designed as an integral part of the
landscaping of the area that will be maintained by the property owners of the
area, then the City Council may modify the requirements of the first part of
this provision to permit a channel improvement design in accordance with the
third of the design alternatives shown.
   (F)   Requirements relating to improvements.
      (1)   Easements. All storm drainage features shall be placed in proper
easements as set out in these regulations;
      (2)   Bridges and culverts. Bridges and culverts shall be as follows:
         (a)   All flow of water across continuous streets or alleys shall be
through culverts or bridges;
         (b)   Bridges and culverts on primary drainage channels shall be sized
to accommodate a 100-year frequency rain, plus one foot of freeboard, based on
the drainage area involved;
         (c)   Bridges and culverts on secondary drainage channels which drain
160 acres or more of land shall be sized to accommodate a 100-year frequency
rain, plus one foot of freeboard, based on the drainage area involved, However,
a 50-year frequency may be used when overflow provisions are incorporated to
accommodate a 100-year frequency rain;
         (d)   Bridges and culverts on secondary drainage channels which drain
less than 160 acres of land shall be sized to accommodate a ten-year frequency
rain, based on the drainage area involved; provided, that all building
elevations shall have one foot of freeboard above overflows of the 100-year
storm;
         (e)   Design of bridges and culverts shall be submitted to and have
the approval of the City Engineer;
      (3)   Closed storm sewers. Closed storm sewers shall be constructed of
pre-cast or prefabricated pipe or built in place of closed box design to serve
a ten-year frequency rain for the drainage area involved; and
      (4)   Open paved storm drainage. Open paved storm drainage channels shall
be approved in accordance with specifications approved by the City Engineer.
Side slopes above the paved section shall be shaped and sodded on a slope of
four horizontal to one vertical or flatter. Fences capable of limiting water
flow or which would prevent proper maintenance and care of the drainage
facility shall not be erected below the shoulder of the sodded section.
Retaining walls or other decorative elements which do not prevent necessary
access for maintenance may be erected.
   (G)   The City Council reserves the right to require improvements,
provisions of drainage easements and for provisions of agreements beyond the
boundaries of the addition to facilitate flow of water though the addition and
to provide continuous improvement of the overall storm sewer system.

water and sewer improvements and two years on street and drainage improvements.
These maintenance bonds shall be irrevocable. In lieu of filing the above
stated maintenance bond, the subdivider may secure and place on deposit with
the city an irrevocable letter-of-credit written by a bank certified to do
business in the state. Such letter-of-credit shall be drawn in favor of the
city and shall be irrevocable for the term of one year.
(Prior Code, § 156.087) (Ord. 1041, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 155.088 RECOUPMENT COSTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to create a policy to assist
in determining procedure for the recovery or recoupment of costs expended for
public sewer, water, surface drainage, or street construction (singularly or
combined hereafter referred to as development) by the owner of property or the
city where development has been placed on property of the owner or the city or
extended beyond the boundaries of the owner(s). Any such developmental
improvements will be voluntary and all costs will be paid by the owner, the
city, or both in any mutually agreed to percentages, so long as such
improvements are in accordance with the ordinances of the city. An agreement
will be signed by all parties making such improvements and the city delineating
the boundaries and scope of the project. Based upon the agreement or the
declaration by the city, a map and a list will be made a part of this
agreement, which will show all abutting properties subject to recoupment.
   (B)   Street construction and storm sewer: recoupment of costs for
additional construction.
      (1)   All eligible costs for additional improvements to streets shall be
recoverable by the owner, the city, or both as appropriate. Eligible
recoverable development costs include the total improvement costs, including,
but not limited to, of all right-of-way costs (both temporary and permanent)
and costs for material, engineering, surveying, utility adjustments or
relocation, excavation, subgrade preparation, storm sewer installation or
relocation (including culverts and bridges), street pavement construction and
turn lanes (in accordance with the city development standards), signalization,
curbs and gutters, sidewalks, lighting, signage, other traffic control devices,
and other amenities, as might be required, plus 2% of the total of all above
costs as an administrative fee to the city. Any of the above items paid for by
general obligation bonds, funds contributed by any private party or
nongovernmental entity, or funds from any other governmental entity which are
not subject to repayment by the city shall be deducted in determining the total
improvement costs, except for right-of-way costs provided for in division (B)
(2) below.
      (2)   The city and/or the owner who funded the eligible recoverable
development costs shall be reimbursed for the total improvement costs of the
development by the abutting property owners who are responsible for development
construction. The original funding entity shall recoup the appropriate pro-rata
share for such construction. Additionally, the costs for all permanent right-
of-way acquisition shall be charged back specifically to that property
assignable to such costs, regardless of the source of funds used to acquire the
property.
      (3)   All properties physically contiguous to the right-of-way line of
the development construction occurring after the effective date of this section
shall be subject to the recoupment program charges. The only exceptions shall
be those properties which have previously constructed arterial streets adjacent
to such properties according to city requirements or those which have made
payments for deferred construction prior to the city entering into an agreement
or commencing design of a designated street. Those exceptions shall be exempt
from the obligations of this section and the corresponding pro rata share shall
be the responsibility of the city.
      (4)   Each tract of property identified in division (B)(3) above shall be
subject to the total improvement cost participation expense equal to such
tract’s pro rata share, any applicable permanent right-of-way costs and
inflation/deflation adjustment.
         (a)   Calculation of the costs of each individual tract shall be
determined as follows:
   Pro rata share = (a - b) x (c / d) x g, where:
   a   =   Total development costs
   b   =   Total right-of-way costs when the individual track is exempt from
paying the right-of-way costs (actual price paid for acquisition of permanent
right-of-way from subject tract)
   c   =   Front linear footage of subject tract
   d   =   Total development front linear footage
   g   =   Inflation/deflation adjustment from date of completion of
improvements to date of assessment of recoupment fee; said adjustment shall be
based on changes in the consumer price index as reported by the United States
Department of Commerce
         (b)   Other formulas may be used, with the approval of the City
Council, for determining the costs of each individual track.
   (C)   Water and sewer lines: recoupment of costs for additional
construction.
      (1)   All eligible costs for oversize or extension of utility lines shall
be recoverable by the owner, the city, or both as appropriate. Eligible
recoverable utility line extension or oversize development costs include the
total improvement costs of the utility line, including all right-of-way/
easement costs (both temporary and permanent) and costs for engineering,
surveying, utility adjustments or relocation, excavation, backfill, subgrade
preparation, pavement repair, utility line construction, and other amenities,
as might be required, plus 2% of the total of all above costs as an
administrative fee to the city. Any of the above items paid for by general
obligation bonds or funds from any other governmental entity which are not
subject to repayment by the city shall be deducted in determining the total
improvement costs, except for right-of-way costs provided for in division (C)
(4)(b) below.
      (2)   The city and/or the owner(s) who funded the eligible recoverable
utility line oversize or extension costs shall be reimbursed for the total
improvement costs of the utility line by the abutting or serviced property
owners who are responsible for utility line construction. The original funding
entity(ies) shall recoup the appropriate pro rata share for such construction.
Additionally, the costs for all right-of-way acquisition shall be charged back
specifically to that property assignable to such costs.
      (3)   All properties physically served by the improvement occurring after
the effective date of this section shall be subject to the recoupment program
charges. The only exceptions shall be those properties which have previously
constructed arterial streets adjacent to such properties according to city
requirements or those which have made payments for deferred construction prior
to the city entering into an agreement or commencing design of the
improvements. Those exceptions shall be exempt from the obligations of this
section and the corresponding pro rata share shall be the responsibility of the
city.
      (4)   Each tract of property identified in division (C)(3) above shall be
subject to the total water or sewer line oversize or extension cost
participation expense equal to such tract’s pro rata share, any applicable
right-of-way costs, and inflation/deflation adjustment. Calculation of the
costs for each individual tract shall be determined as follows:
      (a)   Pro rata share = (a - b) x (c / d) x g, where:
   a   =   Total improvement costs
   b   =   Right-of-way costs when the individual track is exempt from paying
the right-of-way costs
   c   =   Total square footage of liable property
   d   =   Total square footage of the project service area
   g   =   Inflation/deflation adjustment from date of completion of
improvements to date of assessment of recoupment fee; said adjustment shall be
based on changes in the consumer price index as reported by the United States
Department of Commerce
         (b)   Other formulas may be used, with the approval of the City
Council, for determining the costs of each individual track.
   (D)   Recoupment district administration.
      (1)   The total payments calculated above shall become a liability
against property subsequent to the contracting for the improvements. All such
obligations shall be paid in full before the filing of a plat, applying for a
building permit, or making any improvements to the tract subject to this
section.
      (2)   Within 60 days following acceptance by the city of the completed
improvements of the subject development, the Community Development Director, or
his or her designee, shall prepare a tract map and list of the individually
affected tracts and the estimated pro rata share attributable to each such
tract, hereinafter referred to as the map and list. The map and list will also
include all costs, if any, for right-of-way acquisition attributable to each
tract. The map and list shall be made available to the owners of all fee
interests in the affected properties. Notice of the map and list shall be filed
of record in the office of the City Clerk and the County Clerk. Upon written
request to the Community Development Department of the city, notice shall be
given within a reasonable time to the requesting party of the most current
estimate of the dollar value of the participation cost of any identified tract
of property. Except with reference to the filing of notice of the map and list
with the office of the City Clerk, nothing shall be deemed a defect preventing
the city from collecting the applicable recoupment cost under this section.
      (3)   Any owner of a tract of property may, at any time after preparation
of the map and list, cause the tract’s total obligation to be paid to the city.
Unless previously paid, the right-of-way cost and the pro rata share
attributable to each tract, with appropriate Consumer Price Index adjustments,
is due prior to the filing of a final plat for any portion of the subject tract
making application for a building permit or causing any improvements to be made
to a tract subject to a recoupment fee assessment. If less than the total
subject tract is being final platted, the pro rata share for that final plat
shall be the greater amount of either the percent of the total property final
platted or the percent of the property frontage included in the plat. No such
final plat shall be released for filing until the then due total costs are
actually paid.
      (4)   Each identified tract of property shall be subject to participation
in the recoupment program commencing with the date that the improvement
contract is approved by the city. As the total development cost cannot be
determined and notice of the assessment of same cannot be delivered until
completion of the improvement, the City Engineer and the Community Development
Director are authorized to develop procedures for the review and approval,
irrespective of the other provisions of this section, of platting procedures
after authorization of the improvement, but prior to the time that the
property’s total share of the participation cost is determined and can be paid.
The procedures are directed to include, to the extent feasible, the assurance
to property owners and developers that plat approval may proceed so as not to
retard the progress of private development plans, while, at the same time, to
provide financial security to the city that the property’s recoupment share
will be paid upon final ascertainment of the amount owed.
      (5)   Unless earlier paid, each defined tract’s share of the
participation cost shall continue as an obligation of the property for its
determined share of the total improvement cost, plus the appropriate inflation/
deflation increase as outlined in this section, for and through a period of 20
years from the date of issuance of the map and list required in this section.
Beginning at year 21 and continuing through year 30, the pro rata share shall
decrease at a rate of 10% of the pro rata amount existing at the end of the
twentieth year until the pro rata share obligation is reduced to $0.00 and thus
terminates at the end of the thirtieth year from the date of issuance of the
map and list.
   (E)   Developer harmless for impact of later development on subject
infrastructure. A developer shall not be responsible for any later required
upgrades to infrastructure, when the upgrade requirement is caused by other
city approved development which accesses said infrastructure.
   (F)   Intensive use or development. Due to the speculative nature of a
development, the designed capacity of the infrastructure installed may not be
adequate for a later use that is more intense than originally designed. When an
intense use or development is proposed that will exceed the designed capacity
of the infrastructure, as determined by the City Engineer, the new use
developer shall be responsible for any required upgrading cost.
   (G)   City Council approval required. All recoupment districts and
agreements shall require the approval of the City Council. Approval or
disapproval by the City Council to enter into a recoupment agreement shall not
have any bearing on the developer’s responsibility to install any and all
infrastructure required by any ordinance, regulation, or policy of the city.
(Prior Code, § 156.088) (Ord. 1360, passed 2-12-2002; Ord. 1586, passed 1-8-
2008) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.089 MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   Developer harmless for impact of later development on subject
infrastructure. A developer shall not be responsible for any later required
upgrades to infrastructure, when the upgrade requirement is caused by other
city approved development which accesses said infrastructure.
   (B)   Intensive use or development. Due to the speculative nature of a
development, the designed capacity of the infrastructure installed may not be
adequate for a later use that is more intense than originally designed. When an
intense use or development is proposed that will exceed the designed capacity
of the infrastructure, as determined by the City Engineer, the new use
developer shall be responsible for any required upgrading cost.
   (C)   All public infrastructure to be dedicated to the city. Unless
otherwise presented to the Planning Commission and approved by the City
Council, all infrastructure, including streets, sidewalks, water mains and
lines, sanitary sewer mains and lines, and storm water drains shall be
dedicated to the city. Additionally, all infrastructure easements shall be
dedicated to the city.
   (D)   Undedicated infrastructure. When a lack of evidence exists as to
whether the infrastructure in a development has been dedicated to the city and
such infrastructure is serving a public capacity, it shall be presumed that
such infrastructure belongs to the city.
(Prior Code, § 156.089) (Ord. 1586, passed 1-8-2008)
§ 155.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in these regulations and lots of record established
prior to the effective date of this chapter, no building permit shall be issued
tor any now structure or change, improvement, or alteration of any existing
structure on any tract of land which does not comply with all of the provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Except as provided in these regulations and lots of record established
prior to the effective date of this chapter, the city shall withhold all public
improvements and utilities, including the maintenance of streets and the
provision of sewage facilities and water service, from all tracts, lots, or
additions, the platting of which has not been officially approved by the City
Council and for which a certificate of compliance has not been issued pursuant
to these regulations.
   (C)   A violation of this chapter shall be deemed an offense and shall be
punishable as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances and in accordance with applicable state law.
Any person, partnership, or corporation violating any of the provisions of this
chapter upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (D)   The city may issue citations to suspected violators of this chapter,
which citations shall state the violation that is alleged, the time of the
observation of the offense, any correction of the violation which is sought,
the time allowable for the accomplishment of the correction, and the further
action which will be taken to seek remedy should correction not be
accomplished. The issuance of such citations does not preclude the filing of
charges in district court, nor shall the issuance of such citations be a
mandatory process precedent to the filing of charges in district court.

(Prior Code, § 157.004) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.005 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   The boundaries of the zoning districts are established as shown on the
maps entitled “Zoning District Maps of the City of Durant and of Bryan County,
Oklahoma,” dated, which are a part of these regulations and which are on file
in the office of the County Clerk. The maps and all notations, references,
data, and other information shown thereon shall be and are adopted and made a
part of these regulations.
   (B)   Unless otherwise indicated on the zoning maps, the district boundaries
are lot lines, the center lines of streets or alleys or specified distance
therefrom, railroad right-of-way lines, or property lines as they existed at
the time of the enactment of these regulations.
   (C)   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the zoning districts
or when the street or property existing on the ground is at variance with that
shown on the zoning district maps, the Board of Adjustment upon written

(Prior Code, § 157.020) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.021 R-1 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   The R-1 Single-Family District is established as a district in which the use
of the land is for single-family dwellings, except as noted. It is the purpose
and intent of this district to promote the development of and the continued use
of the land for single-family dwellings and to prohibit commercial and
industrial use or any other use which would substantially interfere with the
development or continuation of single-family dwellings in this district. The
intent is to further discourage any use in this district which would generate
traffic or create congestion on neighborhood streets other than the normal
traffic which serves the residents in the area. This district further
encourages only those uses which because of character or size would not create
additional requirements and costs for public services which are in excess of
such requirements and costs if the district was not developed solely for
single-family dwellings.
(Prior Code, § 157.021) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.022 R-2 TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   This residential district is intended to provide for both low and moderate
population density. The density and yard space requirements are so arranged as
to provide general compatibility with the uses found in the R-1 Single-Family

which are adjacent to single-family areas or may be used as a transitional
zone. This district shall have the same restrictions concerning nonresidential
uses as apply in the R-1 Single-Family District.

   This residential district is intended to provide for a complete range of
density in population from low to fairly high. It is established as a district
in which the principal uses of the land are for multi-family dwellings and
similar higher density residential development. The intent is to encourage the
development and the continued use of land for multi-family dwellings and to
prohibit commercial and industrial uses or any other use which would
substantially interfere with the development or continuation of multi-family
dwellings in this district. It is further intended to discourage any use which
would generate traffic which serves the multi-family dwelling or similar
residential uses in this district and discourage any use which, because of its
characteristics or size, would create additional requirements and costs for
public services which are in excess of such requirements and costs if the
district were developed solely for multi-family or other similar residential
uses.

   (A)   Where the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting
streets is divided by two or more zoning districts, the front yard shall comply
with the requirements of the most restrictive district for the entire frontage.
   (B)   Where a building line has been established by plat approved by the
Planning Commission or, in the case of areas annexed into the city, approved by
a governmental agency having legal jurisdiction to approve such plats, and such
line requires a greater or lesser front yard setback than is prescribed by
these regulations for the district in which the building line is located, the
required front yard shall comply with the building line so established by such
plat.
   (C)   For existing through lots, a required front yard shall be provided on
both streets unless a building line for accessory buildings has been
established along one frontage on the plat or by ordinance, in which event only
an accessory building may be built on the line thus established. The main
building must observe the front yard requirements for both streets. In the case
of existing through lots which are bounded on three sides by streets, all yards
between the main building and a street shall be regulated as front yards unless
a front, side, and rear building line have been established by plat.
   (D)   If buildings along the frontage of any street between two intersecting
streets in any residential district have observed an average setback which is
greater or lesser in dimension than the minimum front yard or setback
established for the district in which the street frontage is located, and if no
front building line has been established by plat, then the average setback of
all buildings fronting upon such street between two intersecting streets shall
establish the minimum front yard requirement. All vacant lots shall be assumed
to have a minimum front yard specified for the district in computing the
average front yard. These provisions shall not be interpreted as requiring a
setback or front yard of more than ten feet greater than the front setback
observed by any building on a contiguous lot. The provisions shall be
superseded on any lot where a minimum building line has been established by
plat or ordinance and the front yard or setback provisions of such plat or
ordinance shall be observed. In all districts except CBD, the distance as
measured from the front lot line to the face of the building shall in no case
be less than one-half the height of the building.
   (E)   In residential districts, the minimum front yards specified in these
regulations may be reduced by a maximum of five feet when such yards front on
the bulb portion of a cul-de-sac. In no case shall the required front yard be
reduced to less than 20 feet under this provision.
   (F)   Except where staggered setbacks are permitted and used, residential
building lines shall be uniform for all contiguous lots along a block face.
Uniform residential building lines may be altered on a block face where there
is a separation of 15 feet or more between residential lots created by
intersecting alleys, creeks, and public or private open space.
   (G)   Attached front accessory buildings, including garages and carports,
shall have a front setback from the street or access way not less than that of
the main building or 20 feet, whichever is greater. Detached accessory
buildings shall be located behind the main building.

§ 156.031 I-1 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
   The purpose of the I-1 Industrial District is to provide a location for
industries. The intent is to preserve this land especially for industry in
locations with access to major streets, as well as locations generally
accessible to railroad transportation. Because of possible objectionable
influences that may be created in this district, it is necessary to locate I-
1 carefully in relation to other districts and provide such features as buffers
or setback strips between this district and other zoning districts.

§ 156.032 I-2 MEDIUM INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
   The purpose of the I-2 Medium Industrial District is to provide a location
for industries which may by their nature create nuisances. The intent is to
preserve this land especially for industry in locations with access to major
streets as designated on the major street plan, as well as locations generally
accessible to railroad transportation. Because of the nuisances or other
objectionable influences that may be created in this district, it is necessary
to provide a buffer or setback strip between this district and other zoning
districts, except I-1.

from this average setback, then a building may be erected on the average
setback line so established by the existing buildings.
   E   A building or structure may exceed the maximum height regulations by
adding one foot onto the required front, side, and rear yards for each two feet
of additional height.
   F   Townhomes, as described in the International Residential Code currently
adopted by the city, shall be classified R-3 and require no side setback
limitations when abutting other townhome R-3 property. When adjacent to other

property or other exception situation or condition not generally applicable to
other lots in the same district must justify such action.
(Prior Code, § 157.048) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)

interfere with the permanent residents.
   (D)   The proposed site shall have a front yard of not less than 40 feet
from the corner or line of any mobile home stand to the street boundary of the
park. The site shall have side and rear yards of ten feet from any solid

solid wall fence seven feet in height or a screen planting which will attain at
least seven feet in height.
   (F)   The proposed site shall provide one off-street parking space for each
mobile home stand, plus one additional off-street parking space for each four
mobile home stands.
   (G)   The proposed site shall provide a connection for each mobile home
stand to all public utilities considered necessary for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the public.
   (H)   Individual mobile, modular, or manufactured homes or offices may be
permitted in zones other than R-4 Zone by being issued a conditional use permit
according to §
156.172 of this chapter, provided:

is the major activity on the parcel;
      (2)   If for nonresidential purposes, only for use directly related to
the major activity on the parcel; and
      (3)   Such mobile home shall be enclosed with an approved fence or
planted hedge, not less than seven feet in height with no openings to adjoining
property other than the required entrances and exists to streets or public
places.
   (I)   Municipal or other State Health Department approved water system
capable of supplying fire hydrants installed in accordance with specifications

Department. All mobile homes must be connected to a sanitary sewer system
within 72 hours of arrival in the park. An individual electric service outlet
shall be provided for each unit.
   (J)   The wheels or other transporting devices of any mobile home located in
a mobile home park may be removed. Any mobile home located in a mobile home
park for more than 72 hours shall be securely anchored to the ground so as to
attain the same resistance to wind as a fixed residence of comparable size and
park operators shall require tenants to skirt units so as to enclose the
underneath area.
   (K)   Each space shall be provided with a concrete slab of sufficient size
to support wheels and front parking jack of the mobile home unit parked on the
space.

other than the required entrances and exits to streets or public places, unless
a finding is made by the Planning Commission that this is unnecessary due to
the nature of the site.

§ 156.065 METAL BUILDINGS AND BUILDING FACADES IN ALL COMMERCIAL, RESIDENTIAL,
AND HEALTH FACILITIES DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The architectural design guidelines of this section are
intended to preserve historical, cultural, and architectural character and
development patterns compatible with new construction and major modifications
in order to respect the original architectural character and development
patterns within the city.
   (B)   Applicable zones. Facade treatments for metal buildings will be
required for properties zoned all Commercial Districts (C-0, C-1, C-2, C-3, and
CBD), all Residential Districts (R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4), and Health Facilities
District (H-1). The provisions of this section will not apply to properties
zoned General Agricultural District (A-1) and Industrial Districts I-1 and I-2.
   (C)   Facade treatments.
      (1)   Facade treatment will be on all facades visible from the street but
not to include the rear of the structure.
      (2)   The facade treatment shall cover 100% of the front exterior facing
the street, or on a corner lot, the front and side facing the street.
      (3)   The sides will have 25% of the area improved with facade treatment
floor (bottom) to deck (top), and shall be constructed using the recommended
and acceptable materials listed below in division (D)(3) below excluding the
window areas.
   (D)   Facade design. All visible building facades shall conform to the
following design criteria.
      (1)   Windows and glazing. All facades visible from the street must
contain glazed glass windows. Windows shall be recessed and include visually
obvious sills. Columns and mullions shall form spaces between windows or
material found elsewhere on the facade. Clear window glass is recommended;
green, blue, bronze, or smoke tints are permitted. Window shapes shall be
rectangular, square, or Palladian (mostly rectangular with semi-circular top).
Glazing shall comply with Chapter 24 of the 2003 International Building Code or
the latest version thereof. The maximum permitted reflectance of glass used as
a facade material varies depending upon where the glass is used. The
reflectance of glass used on the first two stories may not exceed 15%. The
reflectance of glass used above the first two stories may not exceed 27%.
      (2)   Building materials. Building materials must be consistent with the
surrounding neighborhood character, as determined by the Community Development
Director or his or her designee. Building materials on the front facade, or any
facade visible from a public right-of-way, must be primarily of natural
materials conveying permanence, as determined by the Community Development
Director or his or her designee.
      (3)   Recommended and acceptable materials. Brick, stone, wood siding,
concrete slab (poured-in-place, tilt-up construction). Split face, scored, or
ground face block, or brick veneer, vinyl siding, beveled wood siding (lap,
board and batter, shake), stucco, and exterior insulation finish systems
(EIFS).
      (4)   Disallowed materials. Metal siding (standing seam panels, aluminum
siding, “R” panels), mirrored or reflective glass.
   (E)   Architectural features. These architectural design guidelines are
intended to preserve the architectural character while encouraging adaptive
reuse of existing buildings, and allowing for compatible new construction and
major modifications. Building facades shall contain architectural features,
details, and ornaments that are consistent with predominating architectural
styles found within the district, such as: arches; roof cornices; contrasting
bases; contrasting masonry courses, water tables, or molding; pilasters or
columns; corbeling; contrasting bands or color; stone or ceramic accent tiles;
colonnades; or porches. Elements such as wall clocks, decorative light
fixtures, and door or window canopies are recommended. Architectural features
will be consistent with the residential neighborhood or the business area.
   (F)   Compliance. If there is a question as to interpretation of any
provision of this section, a written request can be filed with the Community
Development Department for administrative review and action. A review can be
submitted to the Planning Commission and that decision may be appealed to the
Board of Adjustment.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
§ 156.090 PUD PURPOSES.
   (A)   The purposes of Planned Unit Development are:
      (1)   To permit flexibility that will encourage a more creative approach
in the development of land and will result in a more efficient use of open area
or will facilitate orderly land use transitions, while maintaining density and
area coverage permitted in the general zoning district or districts in which
the project is located; and
      (2)   To permit flexibility in design, placement of buildings, and use of
open spaces, circulation facilities, and off-street parking areas, and to best
utilize the potential of sites characterized by special features of geography,
topography, parcel size, or shape or proximity to sensitive land use areas.
   (B)   It is the intent of this section to provide for a change in the size
of tracts in which a Planned Unit Development is permitted.
      (1)   Eligible properties must normally be two acres or larger in size
(gross acreage).
      (2)   Slightly smaller parcels, between one and two acres, may be
eligible, provided the applicant can show that the proposed Planned Unit
Development can meet the intent and regulation of this subchapter without
injury to the public health safety and welfare.
   (C)   In every instance, the PUD is to be reviewed as to the proposed
location and character of the uses and the treatment of the development of the
tract. The regulations of the general zoning district or districts remain
applicable except as specifically modified pursuant to the provisions of this
section. No modification of use or bulk and area requirements of the applicable
general use district or districts shall be permitted unless a subdivision plat
or replat incorporating the provisions and requirements of this section is
submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council and
filed of record in the office of the County Clerk.
(Prior Code, § 157.070) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983; Ord. 1454, passed 11-9-
2004)
§ 156.091 USES PERMITTED IN PUDS.
   The primary uses in a Planned Unit Development shall be those permitted in
the zoning districts involved or those uses permitted in more restrictive
zoning districts (for example, in a commercial district, a Planned Unit
Development could be dominated by shopping facilities or apartments, but in a
multi-family residential district, the predominate land use would have to be
housing). In predominantly residential PUDs, certain other principal uses,
other than dwellings, which are permitted by right or exception in the
residential districts may be included within a PUD, if such uses do not occupy
more than 10% of the gross area of the PUD and are designed and located to be
compatible with the residential uses of the PUD and with the residential use of
adjacent properties. It is intended that the PUD provisions may be used as an
alternative approach in the processing of all types of developments.
(Prior Code, § 157.071) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.092 PUD ACCESSORY USES.
   (A)   Accessory uses customarily incident to the principal uses included
within the PUD are permitted. Accessory signs shall comply with the provisions
of the zoning districts, except as hereafter provided for accessory commercial
uses.
   (B)   Within a PUD in a residential district, accessory commercial
facilities may be included in accordance with the following provisions.
      (1)   In considering commercial uses as a part of a Planned Unit
Development in a residential district, the Planning Commission shall consider:
         (a)   The relationship of the proposed commercial use to:
            1.   The land parcel (both as to boundary shape and topographic and
other physical features);
            2.   The land and land uses outside the proposed development; and
            3.   The arrangement of the other portions of the proposed
development.
         (b)   The nature of the commercial use included in the proposal.
      (2)   In developments proposing more than one business, the aggregate
floor area of the commercial facilities shall not exceed 50 square feet per
dwelling unit nor a total of 30,000 square feet.
      (3)   Each commercial establishment shall be limited to a maximum of
3,500 square feet of floor area.
      (4)   Commercial signs shall be limited to one nameplate or not more than
16 square feet for each establishment. Nameplates shall be attached flat
against a building wall and shall not be animated, flashing, or have other than
indirect illumination. Window signs shall not be permitted.
      (5)   The commercial area shall be designed primarily for the service,
convenience. and benefit of the residents of the PUD. The Planning Commission
may permit a commercial establishment designed to serve patrons both inside and
outside the development if it is determined that a land use problem is not
likely upon consideration of the items listed in division (B)(1)(a) above.
(Prior Code, § 157.072) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.093 PUD AREA REQUIREMENTS.
   The space required in a Planned Unit Development project, including lot
area, area per unit, and percent of lot coverage, exclusive of the area of
public or private streets, shall meet the requirements of the districts wherein
the project is located (as set out in §
156.022 of this chapter); provided, however, that upon a finding that the PUD
proposal is so designed as to provide the best use of the land with, at the
same time, a good and full protection of the public welfare and the general
intent and spirit of the Comprehensive Plan and the zoning ordinance, the
Planning Commission may award an increase in the density of development not to
exceed 10% of that otherwise allowable in the districts in which the PUD is
located. If the project area falls in two or more zoning districts, the space
requirements of the project shall be established by calculating the
requirements of the various districts as applied to the amount of area in each
district. In a Planned Unit Development, all area used for development
purposes, including recreating areas, open space areas, parking lots, and
similar space may be counted as part of the aggregate development area for
computation of space requirements. The area of Planned Unit Development shall
be considered as one parcel regardless of the extent to which the area may be
divided by interior streets or other features.
(Prior Code, § 157.073) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.094 PUD HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.
   The height of buildings shall not be more than one and one-half times the
distance between the building line and the edge of pavement of the nearest
street. The building measurement shall be from the ground floor level to the
eave or top of the vertical wall should there be no eave. The Planning
Commission upon review of plans for a Planned Unit Development may approve
buildings of greater height than otherwise permitted in the zoning district.
(Prior Code, § 157.074) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.095 PUD PERIMETER REQUIREMENTS.
   The building setback from the exterior boundaries of the PUD shall not be
less than the minimum yards customarily required for the district or districts
in which located; provided that within 200 feet of any abutting property in a
residential district, structures exceeding ten feet in height measured from the
ground floor to the eave or top of vertical wall if there is no eave shall
conform to the setback requirements of the zoning district, plus two feet of
setback for each one-foot of building height exceeding ten feet measured from
the ground floor level to the eave or top of vertical wall if there is no eave.
An unenclosed off-street parking area, containing five or more spaces, shall be
screened from adjoining areas in a residential district by the erection of a
screening wall, fence, or hedge of acceptable design along the lot line or

§ 156.097 ADMINISTRATION OF PUD.
   (A)   Procedural steps include:
      (1)   Outline development plan;
      (2)   Supplemental designation PUD; and
      (3)   Subdivision plat.
   (B)   The following may apply for PUD.
      (1)   Any person, corporation, partnership, association, or combination
thereof owning or possessing a property right or interest in or to a tract of
not less than five acres in size may make application for the approval of an
outline development plan as provided in divisions (B)(2) and (B)(3) below.
      (2)   Any person, corporation, partnership, association, or combination
thereof owning or possessing a property right or interest in or to a tract of
not less than one acre in size may make application for the supplemental
district designation PUD. Such application shall be accompanied by an outline
development plan processed in the manner set forth in this division (B)(2) and
divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) below.
      (3)   In areas of existing development, any person, corporation,
partnership, association, or combination thereof may propose the redevelopment
or reuse of land through the processing of a PUD application. Due to the
previous division of land areas in already developed areas, the Planning
Commission shall determine if a proposed site is suitable for development as a
PUD. The Planning Commission and City Council may place the supplemental
designation PUD upon locations through the established zoning amendment
process.
   (C)   An application for a Planned Unit Development shall be filed with the
Planning Commission. The application shall be accompanied by the payment of a
fee equal to that for rezoning applications which shall include advertising and
sign costs. The application shall be in such form and content as the Planning
Commission may by resolution establish, provided that three copies of an
outline development plan shall accompany the filing of the application. The
outline development plan shall consist of maps or text which contain:
      (1)   Existing topographic character of the land and any topographic
changes which are proposed;
      (2)   Proposed land uses, including public uses and open space and the
approximate location of buildings and other structures;
      (3)   The character and approximate density of development. Density shall
be expressed in numbers of dwelling units and quantitative areas of each
identifiable segment of the development;
      (4)   The approximate location of thoroughfares;
      (5)   Sufficient surrounding area to demonstrate the relationship of the
development to adjoining uses, both existing and proposed;
      (6)   An explanation of the character of the planned development; and
      (7)   The expected schedule of development.
   (D)   (1)   The Planning Commission, upon the filing of an application for
the supplemental district designation PUD or the filing of an application for
the approval of an outline development plan, shall set the matter for public
hearing and give 15 days’ notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation. Where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission,
additional notice shall be given by the posting of a sign or signs on the
property. Within 60 days after the filing of an application, the Planning
Commission shall conduct the public hearing and shall determine:
         (a)   Whether the proposal is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;
         (b)   Whether the proposal harmonizes with the existing and expected
development of surrounding areas;
         (c)   Whether the proposal is a unified treatment of the development
possibilities of the project site;
         (d)   Whether the proposal would benefit orderly and proper
development of the city; and
         (e)   Whether the sidewalks and streets provide a traffic flow
compatible with the development and surrounding street pattern.
      (2)   Where a supplemental district designation PUD is required for the
processing of a Planned Unit Development, the Planning Commission shall forward
its recommendation, the application, and the outline development plan to the
City Council for further hearing as provided in divisions (D)(1)(d) and (D)(1)
(3) above and this division (D)(2). Where Planned Unit Development may be
processed without the supplemental designation PUD (five acres or larger), the
Planning Commission shall approve, approve with modification, or disapprove the
outline development plan. Approval by the Planning Commission shall be
authorization for the processing of a subdivision plat incorporating the
provisions of the outline development plan. The Planning Commission, upon
approval of the outline development plan, may direct that a notation indicating
the boundaries of the PUD be made on the zoning map.
   (E)   Upon receipt of the application, outline development plan, and
Planning Commission recommendation, the City Council shall hold a hearing,
review the outline development plan, approve, disapprove, modify, or return the
outline development plan to the Planning Commission for further consideration.
Upon approval, the zoning map shall be amended to reflect the supplemental
designation PUD, and the applicant shall be authorized to process a subdivision
plat incorporating the provisions of the outline development plan.
   (F)   A Planned Unit Development subdivision plat shall be filed with the
Planning Commission and shall be processed in accordance with the subdivision
regulations shall include:
      (1)   Details as to the location of uses and street arrangement;
      (2)   Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of any common open
space as will reasonably ensure its continuity and conservation. Open space may
be dedicated to a private association or to the public, provided that a
dedication to the public shall not be accepted without the approval of the City
Council; and
      (3)   Such covenants as will reasonably ensure the continued compliance
with the approved outline development plan. In order that the public interest
may be protected, the city shall be made beneficiary of the covenants
pertaining to such matters as location of uses, height of structures, setbacks,
screening, and access. Such covenants shall provide that the city may enforce
compliance therewith.
   (G)   After the filing of an approved PUD subdivision plat, and notice
thereof to the Building Inspector, no building permits shall be issued on lands
within the PUD except in accordance with the approved plat. A building permit
in a residential PUD for a freestanding or separate commercial structure shall
not be issued until significant progress has been made on other aspects of the
proposed development as follows:
      (1)   Completion of one-third of the noncommercial features in a project
of less than five acres;
      (2)   Completion of one-half of the noncommercial features in a project
of more than five acres; and
      (3)   The Commission has received a satisfactory progress report.
   (H)   Minor changes in the platted PUD may be authorized by the Planning
Commission upon a review of a proposed amended subdivision plat, incorporating
such changes, so long as substantial compliance is maintained with the outline
development plan and the purposes and standards of the PUD provisions hereof.
Changes which would represent a significant departure from the outline
development plan shall require formal abandonment and the subsequent filing of
a new application for a Planned Unit Development.
   (I)   Where a Planned Unit Development has been processed pursuant to the
supplemental designation of PUD, its abandonment shall require the City
Council’s approval, after recommendation by the Planning Commission, of an
application for amendment to the zoning map repealing the supplemental
designation of PUD. Where a Planned Unit Development has been processed by
reason of being more than ten acres, its abandonment shall require the approval
of the Planning Commission and vacation of the plat.
   (J)   Any person aggrieved may appeal the final action of the Planning
Commission on a proposed outline development plan or on a proposed subdivision
plat to the district court by filing with the Secretary of the Planning
Commission within ten days after the action appealed from a notice of appeal
stating the grounds thereof. There shall be no right of appeal from any act of
the Planning Commission taken in its advisory capacity to the City Council.

property without first obtaining a permit from the City Council in a manner set
forth herein. As used herein, person shall indicate property owner including
individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or any other
entity that owns real property.
   (A)   Application process. An applicant for a revocable permit shall:
      (1)   File a written application therefor on forms furnished by the city
that include the following: the date, the name of the applicant, the location
of the proposed encroachment, including the legal description of the
applicant’s and record owner’s adjacent property, engineering plans as
required, and such other information as the city may deem necessary;
      (2)   A fee of $300 will be assessed to permit applications requiring
engineer plan review; and
      (3)   Provide a copy of the recorded deed whereby the applicant
establishes that he or she is the record owner of the adjacent property. All
record owners of the property shall sign the application as well as the
indemnification agreement described herein.
   (B)   Issuance of permit. The City Council shall inspect or cause to be
inspected the encroachment described in the application. If, in the sole
judgment of the City Council, the issuance of a permit for the encroachment is
in the best interest of the city, the City Council shall authorize the City
Manager or his or her designee to issue the permit upon compliance with all
other provisions hereof. No such permit shall be issued until approval by the
City Council, verification of ownership, delivery of certificate of insurance,
execution and recording of the indemnification agreement, and payment of the
fee. The decision of the City Council shall be final and shall be based upon
all circumstances surrounding the proposed encroachment. Circumstances to be
considered by the City Council and the weight to be given to each shall be at
the sole discretion of the City Council.
      (1)   Non-permanent improvements/items located within the public right-
of-way shall require approval of a revocable permit for non-permanent
improvements/items to be installed by the property owner or tenant with
property owner approval.
      (2)   Such requests shall be evaluated based upon a standard of promoting
public safety and the provision of accessible means of ingress and egress.
   (C)   Revocation of permit. The City Council may revoke a permit issued
under this section whenever the City Council, in its sole judgment, determines
that such permit should be revoked. Such revocation may be on the grounds of
public safety, public necessity, public good, or any other cause which the City
Council, in its sole judgment, determines to be applicable. The grounds for
revocation of a permit under this section shall not be limited to the grounds
set forth in this section.
   (D)   Notice of revocation. Whenever the City Council revokes a permit under
this section, and whenever an encroachment is constructed or maintained on or
over any public property without obtaining a permit, the City Manager or his or
her designee shall notify the record owner of the adjacent premises to remove
such encroachment within such time as the City Council determines is reasonable
under the circumstances.
   (E)   Removal by city. If the record owner fails to comply with the order to
remove the encroachment, the City Council may cause the encroachment to be
removed and charge the costs thereof, plus up to 15% of such costs for
administration, to the record owners of the adjacent property. If any record
owner fails or refuses to pay, when due, any charges imposed under this
section, the City Council may, in addition to taking other collection remedies,
certify any unpaid charges, including interest, to the County Treasurer, to be
levied against the adjacent property for collection by the county in the same
manner as delinquent general taxes upon such adjacent property are collected.
   (F)   Nuisance declared. The City Council hereby declares that the
construction or maintenance of an encroachment upon or over any public property
within the city, without obtaining a permit as required under this section,
constitutes a public nuisance.

hearing and a purpose for the request.
   (B)   In case an application for amendment to the regulations is denied, the
application shall not be eligible for reconsideration for one year subsequent

same property must be substantially different from the application denied, in
the opinion of the City Council, to be eligible for consideration within less
than one year of the denial of the original application.
(Prior Code, § 157.190) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983; Ord. 1090, passed 2-11-

§ 156.171 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   Except for any property of any railway company or terminal company, no land
shall be occupied or used, and any building hereafter erected, altered, or
extended shall be used, and no use of land or building shall be changed until a
certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the Building Inspector,
stating that the building or proposed use complies with the provisions of these
regulations.
(Prior Code, § 157.191) (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-1983)
§ 156.172 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   The following procedure is established to integrate properly the
conditional uses with the other land uses located in the district. These uses
shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following procedure:
      (1)   An application shall be filed with the office of the City Planning
Commission for review. Such application shall be in such form and content as
the Planning Commission may by resolution establish;
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall within 45 days of the date of the
application transmit to the City Council its report as to the effect of such
proposed building or use upon the character of the neighborhood, traffic
conditions, public utilities, and other matters pertaining to the general
welfare and the recommendation of the Planning Commission;
      (3)   The Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council may
establish such conditions which in its judgment would carry out the purpose and
intent of these regulations as a condition or conditions to the permitting of
such conditional use. Thereupon, the City Council may authorize or deny the
issuance of a building permit for the use of land or buildings as requested;
      (4)   For each application for a conditional use permit, a fee as set by
the City Council by motion or resolution shall be paid to the City Clerk-
Treasurer. The cost of legal publication and required notices shall be the
responsibility of the applicant, also each applicant shall submit an accurate
legal description and map of the land and existing buildings. A certified
abstractor’s list of all owners of property located within 300 feet of subject
property shall be submitted;
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall publish a notice of the public
hearing in an official paper or a newspaper of general circulation in the city
at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing giving the time and
place of the public hearing and the proposed conditional use. Notice shall be
mailed to all owners of property located within 300 feet of the subject
property at least 20 days prior to the hearing; and
      (6)   The City Council may make its approval of any conditional use
permit subject to conditions when, in its judgment, compliance of the applicant
to the conditions would diminish adverse impact of the desired use on
surrounding uses. The conditions to be met shall be made an integral part of
the City Council action authorizing the conditional use permit.
   (B)   The following are suggested permit conditions:
      (1)   The use is specifically identified and conforms to conditions
listed in the zoning regulations;
      (2)   The proposed use is not injurious to the present use of the land
nor prevents enjoyment of uses already permitted;
      (3)   The change should not impede normal or orderly development or
improvement of surrounding property;
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and other necessary
facilities are provided;
      (5)   Sufficient off-street parking and loading spaces are available;
      (6)   The conditional use does not create a nuisance (odors, fumes, dust,
noise, and the like) in the area;
      (7)   If the use requires the applicant to obtain a license or permit
from any other regulatory or governmental entity, such permit or license has
been obtained;
      (8)   The permit is subject to periodic review and must be renewed as set
out in these regulations. Any violation of the conditions results in automatic
termination. If not used, conditional use permits are void after one year;
      (9)   The permit is not transferrable from one applicant to another, so
that a change in possession of the property terminates a permit. Caveat: a new
permit must be issued to any subsequent applicant who can satisfy the permit
conditions; and
      (10)   A permit or license fee may be charged in an amount which reflects
the administrative costs of regulating the conditional use program.
(Prior Code, § 157.192) (Ord. 1049, passed 10-11-1983; Ord. 1123, passed 3-8-
1988)
§ 156.999 PENALTY.
   A violation of these regulations shall be deemed a misdemeanor and shall be
punishable as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances. Each day that a violation is permitted to
exist shall constitute a separate offense.

district court stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from
unless the Chairperson of the Board certifies to the Court Clerk, after the
notice of appeal is filed, that, by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. The
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order issued by
the court upon application or notice of the Chairperson of the Board of
Adjustment from which the appeal is taken.

§ 158.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter provides standards for on-site and off-site signs to safeguard
life, health, property, safety, and public welfare, while encouraging
creativity, variety, and compatibility, and enhancement of the city’s image.
The provisions of this chapter are intended to:
   (A)   Encourage signs that are responsive to the aesthetics and character of
their particular location, adjacent buildings and uses, and the surrounding
neighborhood. Signs should be compatible and integrated with the building’s
architectural design; and
   (B)   Recognize that signs are a necessary form of communication, and
provide flexibility within the sign review/approval process to allow for unique
circumstances and creativity.
(Prior Code, § 159.01) (Ord. 1870, passed 12-11-2018; Ord. O-2021-04, passed 2-
9-2021)
§ 158.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Sign permits required. To ensure compliance with the regulations of
this chapter, a sign permit shall be required in order to apply, erect, move,
alter, reconstruct, or repair any permanent or temporary sign, except signs
that are exempt from permits.
   (B)   Sign standards. The sign standards provided in this chapter are
intended to apply to signs in each zoning district in the city. Only signs
authorized by this chapter shall be allowed.
   (C)   Design guidelines. The city’s sign design guidelines will be used in
the evaluation of sign permit applications to ensure that signs are well
designed, compatible with their surroundings, and do not detract from the
overall visual quality of the city.
(Prior Code, § 159.02) (Ord. 1870, passed 12-11-2018; Ord. O-2021-04, passed 2-
9-2021)

   After approval of a comprehensive or lot signage plan, no sign shall be
erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such plan.
In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan and any other
provision of this chapter, this chapter shall control.

§ 158.06 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   A legal nonconforming sign is a sign which does not conform to each
and every applicable provision of the city’s signage regulations, but was:
      (1)   Lawfully in existence prior to the passage of Ordinance 1345, as
adopted on September 10, 2001;
      (2)   Lawfully in existence and in use in the city prior to and at the
time the provisions of the city’s signage regulations with which it does not
conform became effective; or
      (3)   Lawfully in existence and in use on property outside the city at
the time of annexation of such property to the city.
   (B)   All legal nonconforming signs, billboards, or commercial advertising
structures specifically describing the business or nature of a conforming or
legal nonconforming building, structure, or use on the premises may be
maintained during the lawful lifetime of the building, structure, or use.
   (C)   (1)   Although the resulting sign will not be in conformance in all
respects with the provisions of the signage regulations, a sign permit may be
issued to allow replacement, alteration, or relocation on the same parcel of a
legal nonconforming sign provided that:
         (a)   The resulting sign is no larger in square footage than the
original legal nonconforming sign;
         (b)   The resulting sign has received design approval from the
Director of Community Development; and
         (c)   The Director of Community Development has determined that the
resulting sign will reduce visual clutter or visual blight.
      (2)   The resulting sign shall be a legal nonconforming sign.
   (D)   The Zoning Code shall address all other issues of nonconformance.
(Prior Code, § 159.06) (Ord. 1870, passed 12-11-2018; Ord. O-2021-04, passed 2-
9-2021)
§ 158.07 GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR ON-SITE SIGNS.
   (A)   Encroachment into public right-of-way. No sign shall encroach into a
public right-of-way, except that a blade/bracket sign attached to a building
facade may project a maximum of three feet over a public sidewalk, if the
lowest part of the sign is at least 12 feet above the sidewalk surface; and any
temporary yard sign no larger than four square feet per side, that advertises a
special product, sale event, yard sale, community event, political, or real
estate sign may be placed within the public right-of-way five feet back from
the curb or street if no curb exists for a maximum of 30 days as long as the
above mentioned sign does not block a pedestrian sidewalk, cause a visual
nuisance, or block the sign triangle within the city.
   (B)   Illumination of signs. The artificial illumination of signs, either
from an internal or external source, shall be designed to eliminate negative
impacts on surrounding rights-of-way and properties. The following standards
shall apply to all illuminated signs:
      (1)   External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit
direct illumination of any object other than the sign;
      (2)   The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or
brightness that will create a negative impact on residential properties in
direct line of sight to the sign;
      (3)   Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as
to be confused or construed as traffic control devices;
      (4)   Reflective type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed 15 watts
shall not be used on the exterior surface of signs so that the face of the bulb
or lamp is exposed to a public right-of-way or adjacent property; and
      (5)   Light sources shall utilize energy efficient fixtures to the
greatest extent possible.
   (C)   Measurement of sign area.
      (1)   The surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the
extreme limits of all lettering, background, emblem, logo, representation, or
other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or
rectangles with no more than eight lines drawn at right angles.

IMAGES/0-0-0-59.png]
 
      (2)   Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the
display itself shall not be computed as sign area.
      (3)   Double-faced (back-to-back) signs shall be regarded as a single
sign only if mounted on a single structure, and the distance between each sign
face does not exceed two feet at any point. Only one face of a double-faced
sign shall be measured when determining maximum allowable area except for off-
site billboards.
      (4)   Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects (for
example, balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statue-like
trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a
vertical plane. Time and temperature devices shall not be included within the
measurement of maximum sign area.
   (D)   Measurement of sign height. The height of a sign shall be measured as
the vertical distance from the uppermost point used in measuring the area of
the sign to the average grade immediately below and adjoining the sign.
   (E)   Sign copy. The sign copy (text) of permanent signs shall relate only
to the name and/or nature of the business. Permanent signs that advertise
continuous sales, special prices, and the like, shall not be allowed.
   (F)   Sign maintenance. Signs and supporting hardware, including temporary
signs and time/temperature signs, shall be structurally safe, clean, free of
visible defects, and functioning properly at all times. Repairs to signs shall
be equal to or better in quality of materials and design than the original
sign.
   (G)   Sign removal or replacement. When a sign is removed or replaced, all
brackets, poles, and other structural elements that supported the sign shall
also be removed. Affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the
adjacent portion of the structure.

§ 158.15 COMPREHENSIVE SIGN PROGRAM.
   (A)   Purpose. A comprehensive sign program is intended to integrate the
design of the signs proposed for a development project with the design of the
structures into a unified architectural statement. A comprehensive sign program
provides a means for defining common sign regulations for multi-tenant
projects, to encourage maximum incentive and latitude in the design and display
of multiple signs, and to achieve, not circumvent, the intent of this chapter.
   (B)   Applicability. The approval of a comprehensive sign program shall be
required whenever any of the following circumstances exist, or whenever an
applicant requests the approval of a comprehensive sign program:
      (1)   Two or more separate tenant spaces are to be created on the same
parcel;
      (2)   Five or more non-exempt signs are proposed for a new or existing
development; and
      (3)   The Director or his or her designee determines that a comprehensive
sign program is needed because of special project characteristics (for example,
the size of proposed signs, limited site visibility, a business within a
business, the location of the site relative to major transportation routes, and
the like).
   (C)   Approval authority. A comprehensive sign program shall be approved
through the granting of a sign permit for a comprehensive sign program by the
Director or his or her designee.
   (D)   Application requirements. A sign permit application for a
comprehensive sign program shall include all information and materials required
by the Department, and the filing fee set by the city’s fee resolution.
   (E)   Standards. A comprehensive sign program shall comply with the
following standards:
      (1)   The program shall comply with the purpose of this chapter, the sign
design guidelines, and the overall intent of this section;
      (2)   The signs shall enhance the overall development, be in harmony
with, and relate visually to other signs included in the comprehensive sign
program, to the structures and/or developments they identify, and to
surrounding development;
      (3)   The program shall accommodate future revisions that may be required
because of changes in use or tenants; and
      (4)   The program shall comply with the standards of this chapter, except
that flexibility is allowed with regard to sign area, number, location, and/or
height to the extent that the comprehensive sign program will enhance the
overall development and will more fully accomplish the purposes of this
chapter.
   (F)   Revisions to comprehensive sign programs. Revisions to a comprehensive
sign program may be approved by the Director or his or her designee if the
intent of the original approval is not affected. Revisions that would
substantially deviate from the original approval shall require the approval of
a new comprehensive sign program.

§ 158.17 ILLEGAL SIGNS.
   (A)   Penalties. Illegal signs shall be subject to the administrative
remedies hereof.
   (B)   Removal of illegal signs in the public right-of-way. The Director or
his or her designee may cause the removal of any sign within the public right-
of-way or on property that is otherwise abandoned that has been placed there
without first complying with the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Storage of removed signs. Signs removed in compliance with this
section shall be stored by the city for 30 days, during which they may be
recovered by the owner only upon payment to the city for costs of removal and
storage. If not recovered within the 30-day period, the sign and supporting
structure shall be declared abandoned and title shall vest with the city. The
costs of removal and storage (up to 30 days) may be billed to the owner. If not
paid, the applicable costs may be imposed as a tax lien against the property.
