jailed, or otherwise settled the case;

manner provided for in this division (F) shall, in no event, create any civil
liability upon the court, the Court Clerk, the state or any political
subdivision thereof, or any state department or agency, or any employee
thereof, but duplicate proof shall be furnished to the person entitled thereto
upon request.

be imposed as costs in the case. The court may make payment of the fee a
condition of granting or continuing the imposition of a sentence, if the
defendant is able to pay.
      (7)   The court may also require restitution and, in the event there was
damage done to public or private property during the commission of the offense,

manufacturing or transporting any alcoholic beverage in violation of the State
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, being 37A O.S. §§ 1-101 et seq.; and all such
property shall be forfeited to the state. This section shall not be construed
to require a search warrant for duly authorized agents of the Alcoholic
Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission to enter upon and inspect any licensed
premises, but such right of entry and inspection shall be a condition on which
every license shall be issued and the application for, and acceptance of, any
license hereunder shall conclusively be deemed to be consent of the applicant

preponderance of the evidence that the property so seized was subject to
seizure under this section, it shall render judgment accordingly and order said
property forfeited to the state unless seized by county or municipal law
enforcement officers, in which case said property shall be forfeited to the
county or municipality, whichever is appropriate, in which the seizure of the
property took place. Such seized property shall be sold by the officer having
the same in charge, after giving ten days’ notice by one publication in a legal
newspaper of the county or, if no legal newspaper is published in said county,
after five notices of such sale have been posted in conspicuous places in the
city or town wherein such sale is to be made, at least ten days before such
sale. Appeal from such an order may be taken as in civil cases. When such
property is sold under the provisions of this section, the proceeds thereof
shall be distributed as follows: First, to the payment of the costs of the case
in which the order of forfeiture was made and the actual expenses of preserving
the property; and second, the remainder shall be deposited with the county or
Municipal Treasurer of the county or municipality in which the seizure took
place if the property was seized by county or municipal law enforcement
officials, or with the State Treasurer to the credit of the General Revenue
Fund of the state in all other cases.

and local sales taxes paid by qualified manufacturers or distributors for
tangible personal property purchased to be consumed or incorporated in the
construction of a new manufacturing or distribution facility, or to expand an

as the Commission determines.
            3.   Any refund shall be paid from the account prescribed by this
division (E)(14) at the time the claim for refund is approved by the Tax
Commission. The amount of the refund shall not exceed the total state and local
sales taxes paid together with accrued interest upon such total. The amount of
interest paid to a qualified manufacturer or distributor upon the principal
amount of any refund made to such manufacturer or distributor for purposes of
administering the exemption shall be determined according to the amount earned
as invested by the State Treasurer’s office. The interest rate shall accrue
upon the amount transferred to the account.
            4.   For purposes of this division (E)(14), state and local sales
taxes paid by a contractor or subcontractor for tangible personal property
purchased by that contractor or subcontractor to be consumed or incorporated in

billed;
               b.   Affidavit of each vendor that state and local sales tax

but rather the sales tax charged has been collected by the vendor and remitted
to the Tax Commission; and

pursuant to rules promulgated by the Tax Commission.
            6.   In the event that state and local sales tax was paid by a

file with the Tax Commission all documentation required in division (E)(14)
(a)5. above, but in lieu of the affidavit of each vendor the qualified
manufacturer or distributor shall file, for any refund claimed, an affidavit
from the contractor or subcontractor stating that the sales tax refund of the
qualified manufacturer or distributor is based on state and local sales tax
paid by the contractor or subcontractor on tangible personal property purchased
to be consumed or incorporated in the construction of a new or expanded
business activity, and that the amount of state and local sales tax claimed was
paid to the vendor and no credit, refund, or rebate has been claimed by the
contractor or subcontractor.

36 months of the date of the first purchase which is exempt from taxation, with
the Tax Commission a certification issued by the Employment Security Commission
in order to qualify for the refund authorized by this division (E)(14).
            9.   Notwithstanding the provisions of any state tax law, the
amount refunded under this division (E)(14) shall be assessed if the number of
full-time-equivalent employees drops below the number, at any time within 36
months of the date certification is issued by the State Employment Security
Commission.
         (b)   For the manufacturer exemption permit, the following shall
apply.
            1.   In order to qualify for the exemption, at the time of sale,
the person to whom the sale is made, provided the purchaser is a resident of
the state, shall be required to furnish the vendor proof of eligibility for the
exemption as required by this division (E)(14). All vendors shall honor the
proof of eligibility for sales tax exemption as authorized under this section,
and sales to a person providing such proof shall be exempt from the tax levied.
            2.   Each resident manufacturer wishing to claim the exemption
shall be required to secure from the State Tax Commission a manufacturer
exemption permit, the size and design of which shall be prescribed by the Tax
Commission. This permit shall constitute proof of eligibility for the
exemption. Each such manufacturer shall file with the Tax Commission an
application for an exemption permit, setting forth such information as the Tax
Commission may require. The application shall be signed by the owner of the
business or representative of the business entity and as a natural person, and,
in the case of a corporation, as a legally constituted officer thereof.
            3.   Each manufacturer exemption permit issued shall be valid for a
period of three years from the date of issuance. If a manufacturer applying for
a manufacturer exemption permit is already the holder of a manufacturer’s sales
tax permit issued at the time of initial application, the manufacturer
exemption permit shall be issued with an expiration date which corresponds with
the expiration date of the manufacturer’s sales tax permit. Thereafter, the Tax
Commission shall issue the exemption permits at the same time of issuance or
renewal of the manufacturer’s sales tax permit issued.
            4.   The Tax Commission shall honor all manufacturer’s limited
exemption certificates issued prior to the effective date of this act. However,
holders of such certificates shall apply for a manufacturer exemption permit
pursuant to the provisions of this section at the same time they apply for
issuance or renewal of a manufacturer’s sales tax permit.

passenger car in which the operator or passenger possesses a written
verification from a physician licensed in the state that he or she is unable to
wear a safety seat belt system for medical reasons. The issuance of such

such physician thereby incur, any liability whatsoever in damages or otherwise,

system.

crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until green or “Go” is
shown alone. However, vehicles in the right traffic lane after making a stop as
above required may enter the intersection cautiously and make a right turn
unless “No Turn on Red” signs are posted to prohibit right turns; but such
vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian or other traffic in the
intersection, and such turn shall not be made so as to interfere with traffic
proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street.

marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made. In the absence
of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

§ 90.07 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   (1)   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of one or
more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances
may be such as to justify, and even to require, the Town Board of Trustees or
other appropriate officer or agency of the town government to take immediate
and proper action to summarily abate such nuisances or to reduce or suspend the
danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
      (2)   An officer subordinate to the Town Board of Trustees may submit to
the Town Board of Trustees a statement as to the existence of a nuisance, as
defined by the ordinances of the town or law, and a request or recommendation
that it be abated. Any Board member or any resident or residents of the town
may submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the Town Board of
Trustees.
      (3)   The Town Board of Trustees, or its designee, shall determine
whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. Before proceeding to
abate the nuisance or have it abated, the Board shall give notice of a hearing
on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property concerned and to any
other person alleged or deemed responsible for, or to be causing, the nuisance
and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a
hearing can be given. The notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall
be given in writing by mail or by service by a police officer if their names
and addresses are known; but, if the names or addresses are not known, and the
peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person or persons, or public,
adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a
notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation
within the town.
      (4)   If the Board finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for, or causing, the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons, or public, adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for, or causing, the nuisance do not
abate it within the specified time, the Board shall designate a person to abate
the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as
authorized by 50 O.S. § 16. The Town Clerk/Treasurer shall send a statement of
the cost of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible
for, or causing, the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their
names and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to
the town collectible as other debts of the town may be collected.
      (5)   The determination of the existence of a nuisance and order to abate
it, as made by the Town Board of Trustees, may be appealed by the occupant or
owner or person causing the nuisance by filing a request for hearing in writing
with the Town Clerk/Treasurer within the period of time specified in the notice
for abatement of the nuisance. The Town Clerk/Treasurer shall cause the matter
to be placed on the agenda of the Town Board of Trustees for final
determination with appropriate notice of the hearing provided to the person

   (B)   In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate any such
nuisance such town may bring suit in the district court of the county in which
such nuisance is located, and it is hereby made the duty of the governing body
of any such town, by the adoption of a resolution to direct the bringing of
suit in the proper court for the purpose of abating any such nuisance. The
district court of the county in which any such nuisance exists or is maintained
shall have jurisdiction of any such case and power to adjudge and determine any
action brought under the provisions hereof, and where it is adjudged that any
such nuisance exists or is maintained and should be abated, such court shall
have the power and authority either by, and through, a commissioner appointed
by such court, or otherwise, to cause such nuisance to be abated and to assess
all the costs thereof, including the costs of suit, against the property on
which such nuisance existed or is maintained, and to declare such costs a
judgment against said property, and order and direct the sale of said property
for the purpose of satisfying said judgment, and shall cause the same to be
sold and proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the costs of abating any
such nuisance.
(Prior Code, § 8-408)
   (C)   (1)   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 O.S. § 1-1011, the town
shall have the authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises
in the town to remove from such premises, at his or her own expense, any source
of filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the breeding of insects or
rodents that might contribute to the transmission of disease, or any other
condition adversely affecting the public health, within 24 hours, or within
such other time as may be reasonable. Such order shall be in writing and may be
served personally on the owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent
thereof, by the town or by a police officer, or a copy thereof may be left at
the last usual place of abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and
within the state. If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the
owner, occupant, or agent is unknown or is outside the state, the order may be
served by posting a copy thereof on the premises or by publication in at least
one issue of a newspaper having a general circulation in the town.
      (2)   If the order is not complied with, the town may cause the order to
be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified and the
cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be added to the water bill or
other town utility bill of the owner or occupant if he or she is a user of
water from the town water system, or such other utility service. The cost shall
be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added, and shall
become due and payable and be subject to the same regulations relating to
delinquency in payment as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is
not a user of the town utility service, such cost, after certification to the
county for the ad valor tax rolls, may be collected in any manner in which any
other lien or debt is collected, or may be pursued as any debt due the town may
be collected.
      (3)   The Town Board of Trustees, or its designee, may cause property
within the town limits to be cleared of trash or weeds, and grass to be cut or
mowed in accordance with the following procedures: At least ten days’ notice
shall be given to the property owner, by mail, at the address shown by the
current year’s tax rolls in the County Treasurer’s office, before the Town
Board of Trustees, or its designee, holds a hearing or takes action. The notice
shall order the property owner to clean the property of trash, or to cut or mow
the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate, and said notice shall
further state that unless such work is performed within ten days of the date of
the notice, the work shall be done by the town, and a notice of lien shall be
filed with the County Clerk against the property for the costs due and owing
the town. At the time of mailing of notice to the property owner, the town
shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall
indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mail-lee. If the
property owner cannot be located within ten days of the date of mailing, notice
may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property and by
publication, as defined in 11 O.S. § 1-102, one time not less than ten days
prior to any hearing or action by the town. If the town anticipates summary
abatement of a nuisance in accordance with this subchapter or applicable state
law, the notice, whether by certified mail, or posting and publication, shall
state that any accumulations of trash, or excessive weed or grass growth on the
owner’s property occurring within six months after the removal of trash or
cutting or mowing of weeds or grass on the property pursuant to such notice may
be summarily abated by the town.

§ 90.21 REPORT TO BE MADE.
   Any officer or employee of the town who discovers or receives a report of a
dilapidated building which has become detrimental to the health, benefit, and
welfare of the public and the community or creates a fire hazard to the danger
of property, shall report such conditions to the Town Board of Trustees.
(Prior Code, § 8-202)
§ 90.22 ABATEMENT.
   In addition to procedures outlined in this code, the Town Board of Trustees
may cause dilapidated buildings within the town limits to be torn down and
removed, or boarded or secured, in accordance with the following procedure.
   (A)   At least ten days’ notice shall be given to the owner of the property
before the town takes action or holds a hearing as provided herein. A copy of
the notice shall be posted on the property to be affected. In addition, a copy
of the notice shall be sent by mail to the property owner at the address shown
by the current year’s tax rolls in the office of the County Treasurer, written
notice shall also be mailed to any mortgage holder as shown by the records in
the office of the County Clerk to the last-known address of the mortgage. At
the time of mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage holder, the
town shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt
shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mail-lee.
However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be located,
notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property, or by
PUBLICATION, as defined by 11 O.S. § 1-102. The notice may be published once
not less than ten days prior to any hearing or action to be taken pursuant to
this section.
   (B)   The owner of the property may give his or her written consent to the
town authorizing the removal, tearing down, dismantling, or the boarding and
securing of a building and to the payment of any costs incurred thereby. By
giving the written consent, the owner waives his or her right to a hearing by
the Town Board of Trustees.
   (C)   If the property owner does not give his or her written consent to such
actions, a hearing shall be held by the Board to determine whether the property
is dilapidated and has thereby become detrimental to the health, benefit, and
welfare of the public and the community or creates a fire hazard to the danger
of property or needs to be boarded and secured.
   (D)   Pursuant to a finding that the condition of the property constitutes a
detriment or a hazard and that the property would be benefitted by the removal
of such conditions or by its boarding and securing, the Board may cause the
dilapidated building to be torn down and removed, or boarded and secured, and
shall fix reasonable dates for the commencement and completion of the work. The
Town Clerk/Treasurer shall immediately file a notice of dilapidation or
unsecured building and lien with the County Clerk describing the property, the
findings of the town at the hearing, and stating that the town claims a lien on
the property for the destruction and removal, boarding, and securing costs and
that such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and
after the date of filing of the notice, the hearing may be held in conjunction
with a hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass on
the premises of the building held pursuant to this subchapter. In making a
determination to board and secure a building, the Board may order the boarding
and securing when the boarding and securing would make such building less
available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such
building, or decrease the hazard that such building would constitute an
attractive nuisance to children. The agents of the town are granted the right
of entry on the property for the performance of the necessary duties as a
governmental function of the town if the work is not performed by the property
owner within dates fixed by the Board.
   (E)   The Board shall determine the actual cost of the dismantling and
removal of dilapidated buildings, or the boarding and securing, and any other
expenses as may be necessary in conjunction therewith, including the sort of
notice and mailing. The Town Clerk/Treasurer shall forward a statement of such
actual sort attributable to the dismantling and removal, or boarding and
securing, and a demand for payment by mail to the property owner at the address
specified in this section. In addition, a copy of the statement shall be mailed
to any mortgage holder at the address specified in this section. At the time of
mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner or mortgage holder, the
town shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt
shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mail-lee. If
the town dismantles or removes any dilapidated buildings, or boards or secures
a building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of
the labor, maintenance and equipment required for the dismantling and removal
of the dilapidated buildings. If dismantling and removal of the dilapidated
buildings, or boarding and securing, is done on a private contract basis, the
contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder.
   (F)   When payment is made to the town for costs incurred, the town shall
file a release of lien or part thereof. But if payment is not made within six
months from the date of the mailing of the statement, the Town Clerk/Treasurer
shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the County
Treasurer of the county in which the property is located. Upon receiving
payment, the Town Clerk/Treasurer shall forward to the County Treasurer a
notice of such payment, and shall direct discharge of the lien or part thereof.
   (G)   The town may designate an Administrative Officer or administrative
body to carry out the duties of the Board specified in this section. The
property owner shall have a right of appeal to the Board from any order of the
Administrative Officer or administrative body. The appeal shall be filed in
writing with the Town Clerk/Treasurer within ten days after the administrative
order is rendered.
   (H)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property zoned
and used for agricultural purposes.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the town form otherwise abating
a dilapidated building as a nuisance or otherwise exercising its police power
to protect the public health, safety, or welfare.
   (J)   The officers, employees, or agents of the town shall not be liable for
any damages or loss of property due to the removal of dilapidated buildings
performed pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, or as otherwise
prescribed by law.
   (K)   If the Town Board of Trustees anticipates the need to board and secure
a building, as provided in this section, the notice shall state that any
subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six-month
period after the initial boarding and securing of the building, pursuant to
such notice, may be summarily boarded and secured by the town, and that the
costs of such boarding and securing shall be assessed against the owner, and
that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without
further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder.
   (L)   If a Town Broad of Trustees causes a structure within the town limits
to be boarded and secured, any subsequent need for boarding and securing within
a six-month period constitutes a public nuisance and may be summarily boarded
and secured without further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage
holder. At the time of each such summary boarding and securing, the town shall
notify the property owner and mortgage holder of the boarding and securing and
the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request
an appeal with the Town Clerk/Treasurer within two days after the mailing of
the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as provided for in this section.
Unless otherwise determined at the hearing, the cost of such boarding and
securing shall be determined and collected as provided for in this section.
   (M)   The Town Board of Trustees may determine that a building is unsecured
and order that such building be boarded and secured in the manner provided for
in this section, even though such building has not been declared by the Board
to be dilapidated.

interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO Zone on a community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with a 1% chance or greater annual chance of flooding
to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does
not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow
may be evident. The flooding is characterized by pending or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
is subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The AREA
may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After
detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the
FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE,
or V.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   CRITICAL FEATURE. An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.

AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a
building in Zones V-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of
the water; and
      (2)   Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of
the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the
case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, ELEVATED BUILDING also
includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid the to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of ZonesV1-30, VE, or V,
ELEVATED BUILDING also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of
ELEVATED BUILDING, even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway
walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of § 60.3(e)(5) of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations, being 44 CFR § 60.3(e)(5).

structure either:
      (1)   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
      (2)   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

Statutory reference:
   NFIP Regulations, definitions, see 44 CFR § 59.1
§ 153.02 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in 82 O.S. § 1604, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the town does ordain as follows.
(Prior Code, § 17-201)
§ 153.03 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Prior Code, § 17-202)
§ 153.04 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, and streets and bridges
located in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that the property is in a
flood area.
(Prior Code, § 17-203)
§ 153.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 17-204)

restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variance may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to, and surrounded by, lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Prerequisites for granting variances are as follows:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimization of, the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting form the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (J)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements, and for other development necessary for the conduct
of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in this section are met; and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimized flood damages during the base flood, and create no additional threats
to public safety.

improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to, or above,
the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this division (B). A record of such certification, which includes the
specific elevation in relation to mean sea level to which such structures are
flood proofed, shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher the two foot above
grade; and
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screen, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Requires that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A
shall be installed using methods and practices, which minimize flood damage.
For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and
local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. Specific anchoring
requirements shall be:
         (a)   Over-the-top ties at each of the four corners of the mobile
home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations, and mobile
homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per side;
         (b)   Frame ties at each corner of the home, with five additional ties
per side at intermediate points, and mobile homes less than 50 feet long
requiring four additional ties per side;
         (c)   All components of the anchoring system shall be capable of
carrying a force of 4,800 pounds; and
         (d)   Any additions to the mobile home be similarly anchored.
      (2)   All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with this chapter.
      (3)   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM be elevated on
a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is
two or more feet above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
      (4)   For new mobile home parks and subdivisions, for expansions to
existing mobile home parks and subdivisions, for existing mobile home parks and
subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction, or improvement of the streets,
utilities, and pads equals or exceed 50% of the value of the streets, utilities
and pad before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement has commenced, and
for mobile homes not placed in a mobile home park or subdivision require:
         (a)   Stands or lots are elevated on compacted fill or on pilings so
that the lowest floor of the mobile home will be at or above the base flood
level. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall
submit a certification to the Building Official that the standard of this
division (D) complies;
         (b)   Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler are provided;
and
         (c)   In the instance of elevation on pilings:
            1.   Lots are large enough to permit steps:
            2.   Piling foundations are placed in stable soil no more than ten
feet apart; and
            3.   Reinforcement is provided for pilings more than six feet above
the ground.
   (E)   Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard
established in this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge; and
      (2)   If division (E)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of the chapter.

§ 153.58 CERTIFICATION.
   It is hereby found and declared by the town, as of March 5,1987, that severe
flooding has occurred in the past within its jurisdiction and will certainly
occur within the future; that flooding is likely to result in infliction of
serious personal injury or death, and is likely to result in substantial injury
or destruction of property within its jurisdiction; in order to effectively
comply with minimum standards for coverage under the National Flood Insurance
Program; and in order to effectively remedy the situation described herein, it
is necessary that this chapter become effective immediately. Therefore, an
emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this chapter, being necessary for
the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in
full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.
