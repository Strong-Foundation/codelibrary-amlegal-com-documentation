done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued
or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect

construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general
ordinance of the Town herein repealed, and the provisions of all general
ordinances contained in this Code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions
and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this chapter be
deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or
to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the Town under any ordinance or provision thereof in
force at the time of the adoption of this Code. (2017 Code)

effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Code, or any codes or portions
of codes adopted herein by reference. The Town Board of Trustees hereby

sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one (1) or
more sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be
declared unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective.
   B.   Further, if any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or
phrase of this Code shall seem invalid through printing or typographical error,

requirement by providing written notice to the establishment seeking the

waiving the three hundred foot (300') requirement found in this section shall
publish a notice of its intention to waive such requirement in a legal
newspaper of general circulation within the State at least thirty (30) days but

the three hundred foot (300') requirement, to the establishment seeking the
license or to the ABLE Commission. As used in this section "legal newspaper of

grave and immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of
one (1) or more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that
circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to require, the Chair of the
Board of Trustees or other appropriate officer or agency of the Town government
to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to
reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward
such abatement. (2011 Code § 14-8)

Marshal, the Town Attorney and the building official, the electrical inspector,

a nuisance as defined by this Code, the ordinances of the Town or law, and a
request or recommendation that it be abated. The Health Officer, any Town
Trustee, or any resident or residents of the Town may submit such a statement
and request or recommendation to the Board of Trustees.
   C.   Determination Of Nuisance Existence; Notice: The Board of Trustees
shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For
the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the Board shall have the
power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects.
Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, the Board shall
give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property
concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible for or to be
causing the nuisance, an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and
opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the owner and other
persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by a police
officer, if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names and
addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of
the person, persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly
jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published
in a newspaper of general circulation within the Town. (2011 Code § 14-8; amd.

   D.   Abatement By Responsible Person Or Town; Costs: If the Board finds that

responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if
the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person or persons or public
adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or
if the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not
abate it within the specified time, the Board shall direct the Chair of the
Board to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is
practical, as authorized by 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 16. The Town Clerk-
Treasurer shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the
owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just
under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are known. Until paid,
such cost shall constitute a debt to the Town collectible as other debts of the
Town may be collected. (2011 Code § 14-8)

occupant of any private premises in the Town to remove from such premises, at
his own expense, any source of filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to
the breeding of insects or rodents that might contribute to the transmission of
disease, or any other condition adversely affecting the public health, within
twenty four (24) hours, or within such other time as may be reasonable, and a
failure to do so shall constitute an offense. Such order shall be in writing
and may be served personally on the owner or occupant of the premises, or
authorized agent thereof, by the Health Officer or by a police officer, or a
copy thereof may be left at the usual place of abode of the owner, occupant, or
agent, if known and within the State. If the premises is unoccupied and the
residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is unknown, or is without the State,
the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on the premises, or by
publication in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper having a general
circulation in the Town.
   B.   Failure To Comply; Abatement By Town; Costs: If there is not compliance
with the order, the Health Officer may cause the order to be executed and
complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified to the Town Clerk-
Treasurer, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be added to
the water bill or other Town utility bill of the owner or occupant if he is a
user of water from the Town water system or such other utility service. The
cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added and
shall become due and payable and subject to the same regulation relating to
delinquency in payment as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is
not a user of any Town utility service, such cost, after certification to the
Town Clerk-Treasurer, may be collected in any manner in which any other debt
due the Town may be collected. (2011 Code § 14-25)

      1.   Any warm blooded animal, capable of transmitting the virus rabies,
maintained or harbored at any time in the Town shall be vaccinated against
rabies with an approved vaccine administered by a veterinarian or other
authorized person who shall maintain a record of the vaccination for a period
of at least three (3) years, and who shall issue the owner of such animal a
vaccination certificate (which shall be retained by said owner until it expires
and is renewed). The failure to procure such certificate when requested by the
animal control officer shall be prima facie evidence that such animal has not
been so vaccinated. (2011 Code § 3-9)

cat which is six (6) months old or older within the corporate limits of the

      3.   It shall be unlawful to not abide by the Municipal vaccination

   B.   Animal Bites; Quarantine For Observation:

person shall be promptly furnished to the animal control officer and the County
Health Department. The animal, regardless of its immunization status, shall be
securely quarantined at the veterinary hospital of the owner's choice at the
owner's expense. The animal shall be observed by a licensed veterinarian for a
period of ten (10) days, and may not be released until such reasonable
determination has been made that the animal is not infected with rabies, unless
the bite was a severe bite by an unimmunized animal. In circumstances of a
severe bite (bite on the head, face, neck or upper extremities; or deep
laceration; or multiple bite wounds) by an unimmunized animal, the biting
animal should be humanely killed immediately, without damaging the head, and
the head removed and shipped, under refrigeration, for examination at the
Oklahoma State Department of Health. If the animal is not immediately available
for testing, the individuals exposed should consult with their physician
concerning the need for immediate initiation of rabies prophylaxis. In case of
animals whose ownership is unknown, the quarantine shall be at the Town animal
shelter. If an owner becomes known, the animal may be reclaimed by the owner if
adjudged free of rabies, and such owner shall then pay any related charges for
confinement. Signs of rabies in wild animals cannot be interpreted reliably;
therefore, any wild animal that exposes a person should be killed at once
(without unnecessary damage to the head) and the head submitted for examination
for evidence of rabies.
      2.   It is the duty of every physician, veterinarian or other
practitioner to report to the animal control officer the names and addresses of
persons treated for bites inflicted by animals, together with such other
information as will be helpful in rabies control.
      3.   It is the duty of every licensed veterinarian to report to the
animal control officer his diagnosis of any animal observed by him to be a
rabies suspect.
      4.   When an animal under quarantine has been diagnosed as being rabid,
or is suspected of having rabies, by a licensed veterinarian, and dies while
under such observation, the animal control officer, veterinarian or other
designated person shall immediately send the necessary part of such animal to
the State Health Department for pathological examination and shall notify the
proper health officer of any reports of human contact.
   C.   Rabies Crisis:
      1.   Declaration Of Crisis: When the report gives a positive diagnosis of
rabies and the State Health Director feels that a rabies crisis may be
imminent, the Health Department may recommend to the Town Board of Trustees a
Townwide quarantine. Upon the invoking of such quarantine by the Town Board of
Trustees, no animal shall be taken into the streets or permitted to be in the
streets, except for short periods of exercise (under leash and control of a
competent adult). During such quarantine, no animal may be taken or removed
from the Town without written permission of the animal control officer.
      2.   Destruction Of Animals During Crisis Period: During the period of
rabies quarantine, every animal bitten by an animal adjudged to be rabid shall
be forthwith destroyed; or, at the owner's expense and option, shall be treated
for a rabies infection by a licensed veterinarian; or held under six (6) months
quarantine by the owner in the same manner as a female in season. The period of
quarantine may be extended from time to time.
   D.   Surrender Of Suspected Animals: No person shall remove from the Town
any animal suspected of having been exposed to rabies, or any animal which has
bitten a human except as herein provided. The carcass of any dead animal
exposed to rabies shall be surrendered to the animal control officer upon
demand, and the animal control officer shall direct disposition of said animal.
No person shall refuse to surrender any animal for quarantine or destruction
when such demand is lawfully made by the animal control officer. (2011 Code §
3-9)
6-4-10: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   The animal control officer or any member of the Town Board of Trustees,
upon complaint of any person or on his own initiative, shall inspect any
structure or place wherein an animal is kept.
   B.   The animal control officer may issue any such reasonable order as he
may deem necessary to the owner of such animal to cause such animal to be kept
as provided in this chapter, or in a manner so as not to constitute a nuisance.
   C.   The animal control officer may make a complaint before the Municipal
Judge against any person for violation of any provision of this chapter or for
any such reasonable order, but this shall not abridge the right of others to
make such complaints. (2011 Code § 3-15)
6-4-11: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this chapter or
who violates or neglects to carry out any reasonable order made by any health
officer, the animal control officer or law enforcement officer, pursuant to
this chapter shall be guilty of an offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall
be punishable as provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code. The penalty provided herein shall be in addition to other
remedies of the Town and shall not be construed as exclusive. Every day's
violation of any provision of this chapter or of such order of the Health
Officer, animal control officer, or law enforcement officer shall constitute a
separate offense. (2011 Code § 3-30; amd. 2017 Code)

of the dog are directed is about to be bitten or otherwise physically harmed.
   B.   Any person may kill a dog, the appearance or conduct of which is such
as would cause an ordinarily prudent person to believe the dog to be afflicted

CHAPTER 6
MINORS
SECTION:
6-6-1: Curfew Regulations
6-6-2: Tobacco And Vapor Products
6-6-3: Truancy
6-6-1: CURFEW REGULATIONS:
   A.   Legislative Findings: The Town Board of Trustees hereby makes the
following findings:
      1.   The Town has a compelling governmental interest in restricting
certain late night activities of juveniles in order to protect the health,
safety and welfare of juveniles and other persons and their property; and
      2.   The occurrences of juvenile crime have continued to substantially
increase over the past several years, both nationally, Statewide, and locally;
and
      3.   The intent of this section is to narrowly tailor the restriction of
late night activities of juveniles to the extent juvenile crime and violence is
reduced and juveniles as well as other citizens and their property are
protected from harm; and
      4.   Juveniles are particularly vulnerable to the influence of persons
who do not have the best interest of the juvenile in mind, due to the inability
of juveniles to make important or critical decisions in an informed and mature
manner and to avoid choices that could be detrimental to their health, safety
or welfare; and
      5.   The Town and many public spirited citizens have expended a great
deal of time and energy in trying to deter criminal conduct, assist parents and
protect juveniles; and
      6.   A concern has arisen in the community that certain activities by
juveniles and adults during the night hours endanger the health, safety, and
welfare of other persons and their property; and
      7.   The Town does not desire to interfere with the parent-child or
parent-juvenile relationship or the parental right to raise their children or
juveniles; and
      8.   While the Town recognizes parents and/or responsible adults need
wide latitude in supervising their children, the Town desires to protect
juveniles from nocturnal dangers and encourage parental responsibility; and
      9.   The Town desires to assist the State of Oklahoma in the effective
communication and documentation of juvenile offenses, the prevention of
juvenile crime, the prevention of child and juvenile abduction, and the
adoption of programs to assist in the welfare, development, and counseling of
juveniles. (2011 Code § 15-5.1; amd. 2017 Code)
   B.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to:
      1.   Promote the general welfare and protect the general public through
the reduction of juvenile violence and crime within the Town;
      2.   Promote the safety and well being of the Town's youngest citizens,
persons under the age of eighteen (18), whose inexperience renders them
particularly vulnerable to becoming participants in unlawful activities,
particularly unlawful drug and alcohol activities, and to being victimized by
older perpetrators of crime; and
      3.   Foster and strengthen parental responsibility for children. (2011
Code § 15-5.2)

placing, replacing, and removing said memorials and formations. Cemetery
workers shall be permitted to remove trees, plants, obstacles, bricks, or other
items which are deemed a hazard to the mowing area provided that Owners shall
remain responsible for maintenance of their lots and payment therefore.

at a predetermined location and height by the headstone. Reflective markers
will designate that contact(s) are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep
of the plot(s), excluding City employees from mowing and/or edging on that
location. This allowance does not give said contact permission to violate any
other cemetery ordinance. It is the contact's responsibility to properly
maintain the plot while not disturbing the reflective marker. If the reflective
marker is removed and not replaced, cemetery employees will assume upkeep.
Plastic flags or markers of any other kind are not permitted, except for the
designated reflective marker. It is ultimately the owner's responsibility that
all their lots with reflective markers are properly maintained. If any lot
becomes unsightly, the city cemetery staff will immediately assume
responsibility of upkeep. Cemetery workers shall be permitted to remove any
obstacle from a mowing area. Plastic flags, flowers or markers of any kind,
other than Memorial Day as described below, are not permitted with the
exception of plots with the designated reflective marker and items placed on
headstones or areas that do not interfere with mowers.

wastes to which reference is made in this section
9-5-6 shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided in section
9-5-6-4 of this chapter, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole.
In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole
shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to
the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried
out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained and determined from periodic grab samples.) (2011 Code §
19-70; amd. 2017 Code)
9-5-6-6: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
No statement contained in this section
9-5-6 shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement

and/or treatment facilities, of unusual strength or character may be accepted
by the Town for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial
concern in accordance with section
9-5-7 of this chapter. (2011 Code § 19-71)
9-5-7: USER CHARGES; INDUSTRIAL USERS:
   A.   User Charge: For the purpose of providing funds for the operation and
maintenance of the sanitary sewage system and for other purposes as allowed by
applicable law, there is hereby fixed and established a system of user charges
to be levied against each respective user thereof. The base level charges are
based on the costs of operation and maintenance of the sanitary sewerage
system, including replacement, as well as the volume, strength and delivery
flow rate of the sewage. The costs of treating the extraneous flows shall be
included in the operation and maintenance costs. The Town shall review the user
charges annually and revise them as necessary to reflect actual sanitary sewage
operation and maintenance costs among the users on January 1 of each calendar
year. The base level charge is comprised of a charge to service each account,
plus a volume charge for the normal strength sewage, plus a surcharge for
pollutants above normal strength. The Town shall maintain such records as are
necessary to document the adequacy and proportionality of the user charges. The
records shall be maintained as long as required by all applicable rules and
regulations. (Ord. 309, 8-11-2014; amd. 2017 Code)
      1.   Monthly Charge:
         a.   Established: The monthly volume of sewage discharge by each user
shall be assumed to be equal to the amount of water metered to the user, but in
cases where the volume cannot be reasonably determined to be so metered, the
amount of sewage shall be determined as provided in subsection F of this
section. The sewer rates shall be set and established by resolution of the
Board of Trustees of the Mooreland Public Works Authority and approved and
adopted by resolution of the Town Board of Trustees, and posted for inspection
in the Office of the Town Clerk-Treasurer, and shall apply equally to
residential and commercial users without maximum levels of charges to be
assessed. (Ord. 328, 3-13-2017; amd. 2017 Code)
         b.   Annual Fee Adjustment: Commencing July 1, 2017, and continuing
each subsequent July 1, the Board of Trustees shall review the fees charged and
shall recommend adjustment of the fees to the Town Board based upon the
percentage change in the consumer price index, all urban consumers, south
region, all items, during the twelve (12) month period ending in April
preceding the July in question. Any recommended change shall be rounded up to
the nearest nickel. (Ord. 328, 3-13-2017)
      2.   Surcharge System: A surcharge system meeting EPA requirements will
be developed if industries with above normal strength wastes and/or wastes
containing other pollutants that may increase the cost of operation and
maintenance desire to use the sewage facilities. There will be no "above normal
strength" charge nor will there be any reduction in the base level charge when
C is equal to or less than three hundred (300).
      3.   Sewage Analyses: The sewage shall be analyzed as discussed in
subsection B of this section, except the sewage from individual residences and
establishments known to discharge only domestic wastewater is assumed to be
normal strength and will not ordinarily be analyzed. The analysis will be
carried out in accordance with generally recognized methods. (2011 Code § 19-
60)
      4.   Computation Of Charge: The monthly "user charge", as defined in
section
9-5-2 of this chapter and referenced in this section starting with the second
billing following the effective date hereof, shall be computed according to the
formula and rates set and established by the Board of Trustees of the Mooreland
Public Works Authority, approved and adopted by the Town Board of Trustees by
resolution, and posted for inspection in the Office of the Town Clerk-
Treasurer. (2011 Code 19-60; amd. 2017 Code)
      5.   Use Of Sewer System But Not Water System: Except as herein otherwise
expressly provided, each person, firm, corporation, association, institution,
or establishment from whose property or premises sewage is discharged into the
sanitary sewage system of the Town, but who is not a water customer of the Town
and to pay a monthly user charge based upon the quantity of water thus metered
and the strength of sewage discharged, to be computed in like manner as
provided in this subsection.
      6.   Use Of Water System And Secondary Water System: Each user of the
sanitary sewerage system of the Town who is a water customer of the Town, but
who also obtains, uses or consumes water from any source other than from the
Town, is hereby required to meter, at such source, the quantity used, with an
appropriate meter to be approved by the Town, and to pay the monthly user
charge based upon the total quantity of water metered and the strength of
sewage discharged, to be computed in like manner as provided in this
subsection.
   B.   Industrial Cost Recovery (ICR): To be developed and adopted as required
by EPA prior to permitting use by a potentially affected industry.
   C.   Classification Of Industrial Users:
      1.   Minor Users: "Minor users" are those whose industrial discharge
meets all of the following criteria:
         a.   Flow: The maximum hourly rate of discharge, as defined in
subsection A2 of this section, is one thousand forty two (1,042) gallons or
less.
         b.   BOD And SS: Typical BOD and/or SS concentrations of the discharge
from similar industries do not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the values shown
for normal strength sewage in subs
9-5-6-1A2 of this chapter. The user will be classified as an intermediate or
major user if either value is exceeded more than ten percent (10%) of the time.
      2.   Intermediate Users: "Intermediate users" are those whose industrial
discharge exceeds the criteria for a minor user but does not exceed any of the
following criteria:
         a.   Flow: The maximum hourly rate of discharge, as previously
defined, does not exceed two thousand (2,000) gallons.
         b.   BOD And SS: The BOD and/or SS concentrations in the discharge do
not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the values shown for normal strength
sewage in subs
9-5-6-1A2 of this chapter more than ten percent (10%) of the time.
      3.   Major Users: "Major users" are those whose industrial waste
discharge does not meet the flow, BOD or SS criteria listed for minor or
intermediate users. (2011 Code § 19-60)
   D.   Monitoring; Samples:
      1.   The BOD and SS concentrations in the discharge of minor users will
normally be determined from standard values for various industries established
by the Town agent. However, the Town agent will collect samples and may monitor
discharge rates on a random basis.
      2.   The intermediate users are required to cause a sample to be
collected and analyzed at least one (1) time per month.
      3.   The sample shall be made up of individual portions collected,
composited and analyzed so as to permit determination of the maximum hourly
discharge rates as previously defined. The analysis shall be determined and
certified by an independent testing laboratory employed by the user and
approved by the Town agent.
      4.   A report shall be prepared and submitted to the Town agent within
fifteen (15) working days after the sample is collected. The report shall be
signed and shall contain a statement assuring that the sample was collected and
composited in such a manner as to be representative of the maximum hourly
discharge rate. It shall include: (2011 Code § 19-60; amd. 2017 Code)
         a.   The starting and ending time of the sampling period; and
         b.   The hourly rate of flow observed during the sampling period; and
         c.   The concentrations of BOD and SS; and

current industrial discharge permit.
      5.   All costs associated with collection, compositing, analysis and
reporting of these samples shall be borne by the user.
      6.   The sampling point(s) shall be located, installed and maintained by
the user so that any authorized representative of the Town may readily and
safely obtain samples of the discharge during all hours when discharge occurs.
The Town can be expected to collect a grab sample one (1) or more times per
year from intermediate users and two (2) or more times per year from major
users. The Town may or may not give prior notice of its intent to collect a
sample(s). (2011 Code § 19-60)
   E.   Discharge Permits:
      1.   A user discharging industrial wastes into the sanitary sewerage
system prior to the effective date hereof may continue without penalty so long
as he does not increase the quantity of the discharge without the prior
permission of the Town agent, and has discharged the industrial waste at least
three (3) months prior to the effective date hereof, and applies for and is
granted a permit to discharge no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after
the effective date hereof. (2011 Code § 19-60; amd. 2017 Code)

amd. 2017 Code)
11-3A-4: POWERS:
   A.   The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
      1.   Appeals: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an
error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an
administrative official in the interpretation or enforcement of this title.
      2.   Variations: Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
or shape of a specific parcel of property at the time of the original adoption
of this title, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific parcel of
property, which condition is not generally prevalent in the area, the strict
application of this title would result in the peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of
such property, the board is hereby empowered to authorize, upon an appeal
relating to such property, a variation from such strict application so as to
relieve such difficulties or hardship, but may establish such requirements
relative to such property as would carry out the purpose and intent of this
title.
      3.   Exceptions:
         a.   Upon appeal, the board is hereby empowered to permit the
following exceptions:
            (1)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line
of a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown of record. (2011 Code
app. § 88)
            (2)   To interpret the provisions of this title where the street
layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map
fixing the several districts, which map is made a part of this title. (2011
Code app. § 88; amd. 2017 Code)
            (3)   To grant exceptions to the off street parking requirements
set forth in chapter 9 of this title when it is determined that the size and
shape of the lot to be built on is such that there could not be compliance with
off street parking provisions, and that the proposed use will not create undue
traffic congestion in the adjacent streets.
            (4)   To review the uses listed in chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this
title as "uses permitted on review". These are so classified because they more
intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other uses
permitted in the district; however, the nature of such uses may make it
desirable that they be permitted to locate therein.
            (5)   To grant a nonassignable limited permit if the Board of
Adjustment finds one (1) or more of the following to exist:
               (A)   The proposed use is not injurious to the present use of
the land and does not prevent enjoyment of existing uses.
               (B)   The proposed use will not impede normal and orderly
development and will not impede improvements of surrounding property.
               (C)   The proposed use does not create a nuisance such as odor,
fumes, dust, noise, etc. (2011 Code app. § 88)
         b.   The exception permit shall list any appropriate restrictions
imposed on the proposed use. A violation of any restriction is grounds for
immediate withdrawal of the permitted use. The fee for the zone exception
permit is as provided in the fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Town
Board of Trustees. (2011 Code app. § 88; amd. 2017 Code)
      4.   Uses Permitted On Review: The following procedure is established to
relate properly the uses permitted on review with the other land uses located
in the district. These uses shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under
the following procedures:
         a.   An application shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment for
review. Said application shall show the location and intended use of the site,
the names of all the property owners and existing land uses within two hundred
feet (200'), and any other material pertinent to the request which the Board of
Adjustment may require.
         b.   The Board of Adjustment shall hold one (1) or more public
hearings thereon.
         c.   The Board of Adjustment, within forty five (45) days of the date
of application, shall study the effect of such proposed building or use upon
the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, public utilities and
other matters pertaining to the general welfare, and authorize or deny the
issuance of a permit for the use of land or buildings as requested.
   B.   In exercising the powers set out in subsection A of this section, the
Board of Adjustment, in conformance with the provisions of this title, may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end, shall have all
the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. In considering all
appeals from rulings made under this title, the Board of Adjustment, in making
its findings on any specific case, shall determine the effect of the proposed
change upon the supply of light and air to adjacent property, upon the
congestion in the public streets, upon the public safety from fire and other
hazards, upon the established property values within the surrounding area, and
upon other factors relating to the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and
general welfare of the people of the Town. Every ruling made upon any appeal to
the board shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact based upon the
testimony received at the hearing afforded by the Board of Adjustment, and
shall specify the reason for granting or denying the appeal. (2011 Code app. §

all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Chair of
the Board of Adjustment certifies to the Court Clerk, after notice of appeal
shall have been filed, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a
stay, in his opinion, would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
which may be granted by the District Court upon application of notice to the
building official, and upon notice to the Chair of the Board of Adjustment, and
upon due cause being shown. The Court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or modify the decision brought up for review. (2011 Code app. § 89; amd. 2017

application of the requirements of this title would result in substantial
hardship or inequity, the Planning Commission may vary or modify, except as
otherwise indicated, such requirements of design, but not of procedure or
improvements, so that the subdivider may develop his property in a reasonable
manner, but so, at the same time, the public welfare and interests of the Town

12-3-8: Building Lines
12-3-1: QUALITY OF DESIGN:
The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of design
of the individual subdivisions that compose it. Good community design requires
the coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and developer of land within
the urban area. Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be prepared in
accordance with the principles established by the General Plan for land use,
circulation, community facilities and public utility services and in accordance
with the subdivision design standards set out in this chapter. (2011 Code app.
§ 6)
12-3-2: STREETS:

shall conform to all of the elements of the General Plan and shall be designed
in accordance with the following provisions:
   A.   Major streets shall be planned to conform with the Major Street Plan.
   B.   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the Planning Commission may require service streets, reverse frontage
with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear
property line, deep lots, or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
arterial and local traffic.
   C.   Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by arterial traffic
will be discouraged.
   D.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right- of-way or
highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances also
shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and
future grade separation structures.
   E.   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except
where their control is placed in the Town under conditions approved by the
Planning Commission.
   F.   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or
intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan or a proposed
future street system for the unsubdivided portion may be required of the
subdivider.
   G.   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical location
and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivisions with provisions
for adequate utility easements.
   H.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty
five feet (125') should be avoided.
   I.   Street right-of-way widths shall be in accordance with the Major Street

the existing and future estimated traffic load for the facility. Lane widths
for all streets shall be as follows:
      1.   All major streets shall have lanes for traffic movement of not less
than eleven feet (11') nor more than twelve feet (12') in width, and lanes for
parallel parking or emergency stopping of not less than ten feet (10') in
width.
      2.   All minor streets shall have lanes for traffic movement of not less
than nine feet (9') nor more than twelve feet (12') in width, and lanes for
parallel parking or emergency stopping of not less than ten feet (10') in
width.
   K.   A cul-de-sac should not exceed five hundred feet (500') in length,
measured from the entrance to the center of the turnaround and, if more than
one hundred fifty feet (150') in length, shall be provided with a turnaround
radius of not less than fifty feet (50') at the property line and not less than
forty feet (40') at the curb line. There shall be provided in the center of the
turnaround an unpaved island, improved with grass and landscaping that will not
interfere with sight distance, which has a radius of not less than twelve feet
(12') nor more than sixteen feet (16').
   L.   Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of this title; and provided, that the Planning Commission finds it
will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half of the street
easement when the adjoining property is subdivided; the other half of the
street shall be platted within such tract.
   M.   The arrangements of streets shall be such as to cause no hardship in
the subdividing of adjacent properties. The Planning Commission may require the
dedication of street rights-of-way to facilitate the development of adjoining
properties.
   N.   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of
the Planning Commission. (2011 Code app. § 6)
12-3-3: ALLEYS:
   A.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts;

13-1-13: Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability
13-1-14: Violations; Penalties
13-1-1: STATUTE AUTHORITY:
The legislature of the State of Oklahoma has in 82 Oklahoma Statutes sections
1601 through 1620.1, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to minimize flood losses. (Ord.
301, 6-13-2011; amd. 2017 Code)
13-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
13-1-3: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
13-1-4: METHODS OF ACCOMPLISHING PURPOSE:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)

FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP: An official map of the Town of Mooreland on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the Town of Mooreland.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by FEMA for the Town of
Mooreland which contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base
flood, as well as the floodway width, section area and mean velocity.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland waters; or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within Town of Mooreland subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of
the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: A person accredited by the OWRB and designated by the
Board of Trustees of the Town of Mooreland to administer and implement laws,
ordinances and regulations relating to the management of floodplains.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning codes and ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose regulations
and ordinances (such as floodplain, grading and erosion control regulations and
ordinances) and other applications of police power. The term describes such

areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height. A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established
in section
13-1-8 of this chapter. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use that cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair

associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of title 44 CFR.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood

any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the effective date hereof and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date hereof.
OWRB: The Oklahoma Water Resources Board.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION (For Other Than New Construction Or Substantial
Improvements Under The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348)):
Includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. "Permanent construction" does not include
land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include
the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before start of construction of the
improvement. This includes structures that have incurred substantial damage,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Town of Mooreland Board of Trustees to a
person from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full
requirements, see section 60.6 of title 44 CFR.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American Vertical
Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas. (Ord. 301, 6-
13-2011; amd. 2017 Code)

State Statutes.
   C.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and any other ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   D.   Compliance Required: No structure or land shall hereafter be located,
altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
13-1-7: FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   Town Administrator Serve As: The Town Board of Trustees designates the

Administrator or Board of Trustees, as applicable, may approve certain
development in Zones A, AO or AE delineated on the Woodward County FIRM which
increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot
(1'); provided, that the applicant for the development permit in that case
first complies with 44 CFR section 65.12. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
13-1-10: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
      1.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
      2.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      3.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      4.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
      6.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
      7.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated at a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood
elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor
shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard
of this subsection B1 is satisfied.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at a minimum of one
foot (1') above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer,
architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Floodplain
Administrator that the standard of this subsection B2 is satisfied.
      3.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided;
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade; and
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
      4.   Manufactured Homes: Require that all manufactured homes to be placed
anywhere within the Town within Zones A, AO and AE on the Town FIRM shall be
installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage and have the
bottom of the I-beam elevated at or above the BFE. For the purposes of this
requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. This requirement is in addition to
applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
The home shall be installed by a licensed installer according to Oklahoma State
law, and compliance herewith shall be certified in writing to the Floodplain
Administrator by said installer prior to habitation of the manufactured home.
      5.   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A, AO and AE on the Woodward County FIRM either:
         a.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;

         c.   Meet the permit requirements of section
13-1-9 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
manufactured homes in subsection B4 of this section. A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions.
      6.   Accessory Structures: Accessory structures to be placed on sites
within Zones A, AO and AE on the Woodward County FIRM shall comply with the
following:
         a.   The structure shall be unfinished on the interior;
         b.   The structure shall be used only for parking and limited storage;
         c.   The structure shall not be used for human habitation. Prohibited
activities or uses include, but are not limited to, working, sleeping, living,
cooking, or restroom use;
         d.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment must
be elevated to or above the BFE;
         e.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
         f.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential and constructed with flood resistant materials;
         g.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement;
         h.   Floodway requirements must be met in the construction of the
structure;
         i.   Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be
provided below the BFE; and
         j.   The structure shall be located so as not to cause damage to
adjacent and nearby structures.
   C.   Standards For Subdivisions:
      1.   The applicant for a development permit for any subdivision located
in Zones A, AO and AE which is fifty one (51) or more lots or greater than five
(5) acres shall generate the base flood elevation data for that subdivision.
      2.   All subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks
and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
      3.   All subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks
and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage.
   D.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones): Located within the
areas of special flood hazard established in section
13-1-8 of this chapter, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one foot (1') to
three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. Therefore, the following
provisions apply:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and
nonresidential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
one foot (1') above the base flood elevation (the depth number specified in
feet on the Town's FIRM or at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
      2.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in section
13-1-9 of this chapter are satisfied.
      3.   Require within Zone AO adequate drainage paths around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   E.   Floodways: The following provisions shall apply to floodways:
      1.   Encroachments including, but not limited to, fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development are prohibited within the
adopted floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the Town during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection E1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
      3.   The Town may permit encroachments within the adopted floodway that
would result in an increase in base flood elevations; provided, that the
applicant for the development permit complies with all of 44 CFR section 65.12.
(Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
13-1-11: VARIANCES:
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   The Board of Trustees may grant variances for uses which do not
satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or this
chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that: a)
compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable
taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people; and
b) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section. However, no variance
shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the
continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
      2.   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the State.
      3.   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
twenty (20) years. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
      4.   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the Board
of Trustees, accompanied by a filing fee as provided in the fee schedule
adopted by resolution of the Town Board of Trustees. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011; amd.
2017 Code)
      5.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, provided the relevant factors in this section and subs
13-1-9C of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      6.   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice, signed by the Chair of the Board of
Trustees which states that: a) the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built
lower than the base flood elevation; and b) such construction below the base
flood level increases risks to life and property.
      7.   At such time as the Board of Trustees deems the petition ready for
notification to the public, the Board of Trustees shall schedule a hearing and
direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in Woodward County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing.
(Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
      8.   The Board of Trustees shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section.
The Board of Trustees shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities
involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the
public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted. (Ord.
301, 6-13-2011; amd. 2017 Code)
      9.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and
         d.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      10.   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the
intent of this chapter, the Board of Trustees may attach such conditions to the
granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives stated in section
13-1-3 of this chapter.
      11.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance issued by the Board of Trustees shall be sent by the Floodplain
Administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of
the variance. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
   B.   Certain Variances Permitted; Conditions:
      1.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the State of Oklahoma Inventory of Historic
Places by the State Historic Preservation Office of the Oklahoma Historical
Society, without regard to the procedures set forth in sections
13-1-10,
13-1-12 and
13-1-14 of this chapter. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011; amd. 2017 Code)
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      4.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use; provided, that:
         a.   The criteria of subsections A5, A9, B2 and B3 of this section are
met; and
         b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
13-1-12: FEE SCHEDULE:
The fees applicable to this chapter are as provided in the fee schedule adopted
by resolution of the Town Board of Trustees. (2017 Code)
13-1-13: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur, and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Town or any official or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 301, 6-13-2011)
13-1-14: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate or other certifications required in this chapter is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
