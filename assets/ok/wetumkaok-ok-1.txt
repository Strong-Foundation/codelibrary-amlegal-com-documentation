§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any ordinance
provision of this code of ordinances shall be fined as prescribed by the
ordinances of the city and in any sum not to exceed the amount established by
statute for the same offense. Each day's continuation of any such violation
shall be deemed a separate offense.
   (B)   (1)   If the defendant pleads or is found guilty of an offense against
the city, the Municipal Judge shall declare and assess the punishment
prescribed by the ordinances of the city, and shall render judgment of fines
and costs accordingly. The Municipal Judge shall also order that the defendant
be committed to the city jail, as defined below, until the judgment is complied
with, unless the defendant pays the fines and costs assessed or stays the
execution of the judgment by giving a good and sufficient bond, to be approved
by the Judge, conditioned that the defendant will pay the fines and costs
within 30 days from the date of the judgment. The Municipal Judge shall also
order that an incarceration fee of $10 a day be placed upon those who are
incarcerated within the city jail. This fee will be imposed upon release from
custody, payment plans can be made as long as fee is paid within 120 days of
release with minimum payment of $40 per month. If payment or payment
arrangement have not been made, a warrant shall be issued and all fees must be
paid before release. If the defendant, on conviction or plea of guilty, fails
to pay the fines and costs to stay the execution of judgment as provided herein
or if, after staying the execution of judgment, the defendant fails to pay the
lines and costs assessed, the Judge may commit the defendant to the city jail
for period up to, but not to exceed, one year. Upon payment of all fines and
costs, the Judge shall discharge such defendant unless the defendant is held
for another legal cause.
      (2)   The maximum fine, or deferral fee in lieu of a fine, for offenses
shall not exceed the prescribed amounts as set forth in 11 O.S. § 14-111(C) and
11 O.S. § 27-104xx, including all amendments and changes thereto.
   (C)   Except as otherwise provided herein, prisoners confined to jail on
conviction, or plea of guilty, or for malicious prosecution, if their health
permits, may be permitted to work on the public streets, avenues, alleys, parks
or other public premises and property, at the rates per day fixed below. It
shall be the duty of the Chief of Police, subject to the direction of the City
Manager, to direct where the work shall be performed. It shall be the duty of
the head of the department in charge of the premises or property on which the
work is to be performed, to oversee such work. Any prisoner deemed a threat by
the Chief of Police shall be ineligible for to work as provided in this
section.
   (D)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided herein, any prisoner permitted to
work shall have credited toward their fine the minimum amount per day for
useful labor as prescribed by 11 O.S. § 14-111(A), including all amendments and
changes thereto. Except as otherwise provided herein, in the case of a prisoner
refusing to work, or being ineligible as provided above, a prisoner shall be
credited with $10 per day toward the payment of a fine assessed against them
for each day's imprisonment.
      (2)   Costs, including court costs and costs of jailing, shall not be
credited for imprisonment. The City Manager may credit any amount earned for
useful labor against a prisoners costs. Except as provided herein, all costs
shall be collected upon release or pursuant to a probation agreement to avoid
future violations and to make payment on all costs assessed within a set time
period. A prisoner's refusal to pay costs or execute a probation agreement is a
proper basis for continued imprisonment until costs are paid or probation
agreement is executed. The Municipal Judge may subsequently order the party
imprisoned for failure to fully satisfy probation agreement for any violation
thereof or failure to pay all costs assessed by the end of the probation
period.
      (3)   The Chief of Police shall cause all prisoners of the city to be fed
three meals of plain, wholesome food a day at the expense of the city.
      (4)   If any prisoner confined to jail on conviction on plea of guilty,
or for malicious prosecution, whose health would permit him to work, shall
refuse to work when requested, he or she shall be kept in close confinement.
During such time as the prisoner refuses to work, the prisoner shall be
credited with only $5 per day toward the payment of line assessed against them.
      (5)   Any prisoner who shall be imprisoned and confined may be
transported to the county jail, or any other municipal jail under contract with
the city, hereafter the "city jail", and placed therein until payment of fines
and costs have been completed.
      (6)   The Chief of Police shall contract with the County Sheriff or other
municipality for jail use and for payment of costs incurred, which may be
assessed to each prisoner as costs to be reimbursed to the city. All such
contracts shall be subject to approval by the City Council by duly adopted
resolution or ordinance.

§ 130.01 CURFEW FOR MINORS.
   (A)   Offenses against the public.
      (1)   The purpose and intent of this section is to narrowly tailor the
restriction of late-night activities of juveniles to the extent juvenile crime
is reduced and juveniles, as well as other citizens, and their property are
protected from harm.
      (2)   Juveniles are particularly vulnerable to the influences of persons
who do not have the best interests of the juvenile in mind, due to the
inability of juveniles to make important or critical decisions in an informed
and mature matter and to avoid choices which could be detrimental to their
health, safety and welfare.
      (3)   The concern has arisen in the community that certain activities by
juveniles and adults, during the late night hours, endanger the health, safety
and welfare of other persons and their property.
      (4)   The city does not desire to interfere with parent-child or parent-
juvenile relationships or the parental right to raise their children or
juveniles.
      (5)   While the city recognizes parents and/or responsible adults need
wide latitude in supervising their children, the city desires to protect
juveniles from nocturnal dangers, and encourage parental responsibility.
      (6)   The public purpose of this section is to protect juveniles from
nocturnal dangers, enhance parental supervision and responsibility of juveniles
and protect the public at-large.
   (B)   Responsibility of owners of public places. It shall be unlawful for a
person operating or having charge of any public place to knowingly allow,
permit or suffer the presence of juveniles in violation of the curfew
established by this section.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following

age of 18 years of age”.
      KNOWINGLY PERMIT. The parent, other responsible adult and/or operator, as
defined herein, is aware of the fact the juvenile is in violation of the curfew
hours or that said person, by exercise of reasonable care, would have known
that the juvenile is in violation of the curfew hours.
      PARENT. A person who is a natural parent, adoptive parent or step-parent
of another person.
      PUBLIC PLACE. Any place to which the public or a substantial group of the
public has access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, alleys,

custody of a juvenile at the request of, or on behalf of, another parent.

place or on the premises of any establishment within the corporate limits of
the city during curfew hours.
      (2)   A parent and/or responsible adult of a juvenile commits an offense
if:
         (a)   He or she knowingly permits or allows the juvenile to remain in
any public place or on the premises of any establishment within the corporate
city limits during curfew hours; and
         (b)   The parent and/or responsible adult of the juvenile has
previously been cited so as to knowingly permit or allow a juvenile to remain
in any pubic place or on the premises of any establishment within the corporate
limits of the city during curfew hours. Every subsequent violation thereof will
constitute a separate violation.
      (3)   The owner, operator or any employee of an establishment commits an
offense if he or she knowingly permits or allows a juvenile to remain upon the
premises of the establishment during curfew hours.
   (E)   Defenses. It is a defense to prosecution under division (D) above that
the juvenile was at the time in question:
      (1)   Accompanied by the juvenile’s parent or responsible adult. The
responsible adult must be an adult authorized by a parent of such juvenile to
take said parent’s place in accompanying said juvenile for a designated period
of time and purpose within a specified area;
      (2)   Engaged in any lawful employment activity, or going to or returning
home from a lawful employment activity without any detour or stop;
      (3)   Involved in an emergency;
      (4)   In a motor vehicle involved in interstate or intrastate traffic.
INTRASTATE TRAFFIC means to the city from a point outside the city limits for
the purpose of returning to one’s home or from the city to a point outside the
city limits. INTERSTATE TRAFFIC means all other traffic moving through said
city from a point outside the city limits to a point outside the city limits
and stopping in said city for the purpose of nourishment and/or service to
one’s mode of transportation;
      (5)   Attending, going to or returning home without any detour or stop
from an official school, religious or other recreational activity supervised by
adults, or an event sponsored by the city, a civic organization or any
recognized entity that takes responsibility for the juvenile;
      (6)   On an errand at the direction of the juvenile’s parents or
responsible adult, without any detour or stop;
      (7)   Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, or other rights protected by the Unites States or State
Constitution, such as the free exercise of “religion”, freedom of speech and
the right of assembly. Such juvenile shall evidence the bona fides of such
exercise by possessing a written communication, signed in such juvenile and
countersigned by a parent of such juvenile and with his, her or their home
address and telephone number, specifying when, and where and in what manner,
said juvenile will be in or on a public place at night (during hours when this
section is otherwise applicable to said juvenile) in the exercise of a First
Amendment right specified in such communication;
      (8)   When the juvenile is on the sidewalk of the place where such
juvenile resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not
communicating an objection to a police officer;
      (9)   The juvenile is married or has been married;
      (10)   When authorized by regulation issued by the City Council, in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to
necessary night-time activities of more minors that can readily be dealt with
on an individual special permit basis. Normally, such regulation by the City
Council permitting use of a public place should be issued sufficiently in
advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other
agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the
use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved not to exceed
more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the
reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is
consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this section; and
      (11)   It is a defense to prosecution under division (D)(3) above that
the owner, operator or employee of an establishment promptly notify the Police
Department that a juvenile was present on the premises of the establishment
during curfew hours and refused to leave.
   (F)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Generally. Before taking any enforcement action under this division
(F), a police officer shall ask the apparent offender’s reason for being in the
public place. The police officer shall not issue a citation or make an arrest
under this division (F) unless the officer reasonably believes that an offense
has occurred and, based on circumstances, no defense in division (E) above is
present.
      (2)   Parental or responsible adult responsibility.
         (a)   It shall be unlawful for a parent or responsible adult having
legal custody of a juvenile knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to
allow such juvenile to be or remain in or upon any public place or under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this section.
         (b)   The term KNOWINGLY includes knowledge which a parent or
responsible adult should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent’s or responsible adult’s legal
custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up
to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an
objective test.
         (c)   It shall not be a defense that a parent or responsible adult is
completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such
juvenile.
      (3)   Police procedures.
         (a)   A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention
culled to any juvenile in or on a public place is a prima facie violation of
this section; the police officer, normally, shall take the juvenile to the city
police station, or other place designated by the Chief of Police, where a
parent or responsible adult shall immediately be notified to come for such
juvenile whereupon he, she or they (parent and/or responsible adult and
juvenile) shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit ascertainment,
under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize
responsibility in the personnel then on duty for accurate, effective, fair,
impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making available
experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access to
information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth
certificate, a police officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use
his or her best judgment in determining age.
         (b)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent or
responsible adult, as the case may be, thereof a juvenile under appropriate
circumstances, for example a juvenile of tender age near home whose identity
may readily be ascertained or are known.
         (c)   When a parent or responsible adult, immediately called, has come
to take charge of the juvenile, and the appropriate information has been
recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent or
responsible adult. If the parent or responsible adult cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released to
the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will, on
behalf of a parent or responsible adult, assume the responsibility of caring
for juvenile pending the availability or arrival of such parent or responsible
adult.
         (d)   In the case of a first violation by a juvenile, the Chief of
Police shall cause to be personally delivered or, by certified mail, send to a
parent or responsible adult, as the case may be, written notice of said
violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full
enforcement of this section, including enforcement of parental responsibility
and of applicable penalties.
   (G)   Violations.
      (1)   If, after the warning notice pursuant to division (F)(3)(d) above
of a first violation by a juvenile, the juvenile commits a second violation
under the terms of division (D)(1) above and the parent or responsible person
violates division (D)(2)(a) above is guilty of a separate offense for each day,
or part of a day, during which the violation is committed, continued or
permitted. Each offense, upon conviction, is punishable by the maximum line
authorized by law. The court may require community service work in lieu of a
line if the product of multiplying the number of hours of community service
work by the prevailing wage does not result in a number which exceeds the
maximum line authorized by law.
      (2)   The Municipal Court’s jurisdiction over a juvenile who violates
division (D)(1) above shall be expressly subject to 10A O.S. §§ 2-2-101 et seq.
   (H)   Interlocal agreement. Absent an interlocal agreement with the District
Court for the Municipal Court to exercise jurisdiction over juveniles under 17
years of age under division (C) above pursuant to 10A O.S. §§ 2-2-101 et seq.,
the Municipal Court must refer all alleged juvenile violations to the Juvenile
Bureau of the District Attorney’s office.
