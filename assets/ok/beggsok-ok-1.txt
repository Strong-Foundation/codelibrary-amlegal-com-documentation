      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal
wastewater collection system, including, but not limited to, waste streams with
a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140°F, or 60°C, using the test methods
specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.21. At no time shall two consecutive readings on
an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system or at any
point within the system, be more than 5%, nor any single reading be more than
10% of the lower explosive limit of the meter;
      (2)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction
of the flow in the system resulting in interference, but in no case solids of
greater than one-half inch;
      (3)   Any wastewater having a pH of less than 5.5 or more than 12 SU, or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the system or equipment or
endangering city personnel;
      (4)   Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen-demanding
pollutants such as BOD and the like, released in a discharge at a flow rate of
pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with either the system or any wastewater
treatment or sludge process which will constitute a hazard to human or animal
life;

      (6)   Any substance which may cause the wastewater or the residue found
within the wastewater, such as sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse, or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged into the system be in noncompliance with the Solid
Waste Disposal Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq., as adopted within the
United States, the state or the city;
      (7)   Any wastewater which imparts color that cannot be removed in the
treatment process and which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant’s
effluent;

radioactive waste or component unless specifically allowed pursuant to state or
federal regulations;
      (10)   Any free or emulsified fat, wax, grease or oil of animal or

      (12)   Any salts of heavy metals that are of such a concentration so as
to be toxic to the wastewater treatment process.

      (2)   It is recognized that circumstances may be such so as to justify,
and even to require, the city or other appropriate officer or agency of the
city government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such
nuisances or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can
be taken toward such abatement.
   (B)   An officer of the city may submit a statement as to the existence of a
nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or law, and a request or
recommendation that it be abated.
   (C)   (1)   The city, or its designee, shall determine if a nuisance exists
as defined by the ordinances of the city or law. If a nuisance does in fact
exist, then city personnel shall direct the owner or other persons responsible
for or causing the nuisance to abate the nuisance within a specified time, if
the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person or persons or the
public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent
delay, by:
         (a)   Mailing of notice by the city, with a receipt of mailing being
obtained from the U.S. post office, said receipt showing the date of mailing
and the name and address of the mailee. Said receipt of mailing shall be
properly kept in the records of the city to prove that such mailing was
accomplished;
         (b)   Posting notice on the property in question in a prominent place
if the address of said property owner cannot be obtained, or again if the
address cannot be obtained; and
         (c)   Publication in a newspaper in general circulation within the
community for one time not less than ten days prior to any action or hearing by
the city.
      (2)   If such peace, health, safety, morals or welfare would be unduly
jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons
responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within the specified
time, or if the persons responsible authorize the city to abate the nuisance,
then the city shall direct the appropriate officer to abate the nuisance or
have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 O.S. §
16.
      (3)   The city shall send a statement of the cost of such summary
abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the
nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses
are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city,
collectible as other debts may be collected.
   (D)   The determination of the existence of a nuisance and order to abate
it, as made by the city, may be appealed by the occupant or owner or person
causing the nuisance by filing a request for hearing in writing with the city
within the period of time specified in the notice for abatement of the
nuisance. The City Clerk shall cause the matter to be placed on the agenda of
the City Council for final determination, with appropriate notice of the
hearing provided to the person requesting the appeal.

§ 93.05 ABATEMENT; NOTICE, CONSENT, HEARING, LIEN AND PAYMENT.
   The city’s Administrative Officer is authorized to cause property within the
city to be cleaned of trash and weeds, or grass to be cut or mowed, and the
nuisance to be abated in accordance with the following procedure.
   (A)   The city’s Administrative Officer or his or her designee may determine
whether the accumulation of trash, growth of weeds or grass or other nuisance
has caused the property to become detrimental to the health, benefit or welfare
of the public and the community or a hazard to traffic, or creates a fire
hazard to the danger of the property.
   (B)   At least ten days’ notice shall be given to the property owner and/or
occupant of the property. Said notice may be given by posting the property by
use of a door hanger or other such notice, if occupied, and by mail at the
address shown by the current year’s tax rolls in the County Treasurer’s office
by both certified and first-class mail to the owner of the property. The notice
shall order the property owner and/or occupant to clean the property of trash
or to cut or mow the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate. The notice
shall state that unless the work is performed within ten days of the date of
the notice, the work shall be done by the city and a notice of lien shall be
filed with the County Clerk against the property for the costs due and owing
the city.
   (C)   At the time of mailing of notice to the property owner, the city shall
obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall
indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the addressee.
   (D)   (1)   If the city anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in
accordance with the provisions as herein provided, then the notice shall state:
that any accumulations of trash or excessive weeds or grass growth on the
owner’s property occurring within six months after the removal of trash or the
cutting or mowing of weeds or grass on the property pursuant to the notice may
be summarily abated by the city, that the costs of such abatement shall be
assessed against the owner and that a lien shall be imposed on the property to
secure such payment, all without further notice to the property owner.
      (2)   At the time of each summary abatement, the City Clerk shall notify
the property owner of the abatement and costs thereof. That notice shall state
that the property owner may request a hearing within ten days after the date of
the notice to determine the cost of the cleanup. Unless otherwise determined at
the hearing, the cost of such abatement shall be determined and collected as
provided in this section.
   (E)   The owner of the property may give his or her written consent to the
city authorizing the removal of the trash or the mowing of the weeds or grass.
By giving his or her written consent, the owner waives his or her right to a
hearing by the city.
   (F)   A hearing may be held by the Administrative Officer to determine
whether the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass has caused
the property to become detrimental to the health, benefit or welfare of the
public and the community, or a hazard to traffic, or creates a fire hazard to
the danger of property. The property owner shall have a right of appeal to the
city’s Administrative Officer, except that if the city’s Administrative Officer
conducts the initial hearing, then the right of appeal is to the City Council.
The appeal shall be taken by filing a written notice of appeal with the city’s
Administrative Officer within ten days after the administrative order is
rendered.
   (G)   (1)   If the Administrative Officer finds that the condition of the
property constitutes a detriment or hazard and that the property would be
benefitted by the removal of such conditions, then the Administrative Officer
shall direct that the clearing or cleaning be done by one of the following
methods:
         (a)   By the city, provided the actual cost of the labor, maintenance
and equipment required does not exceed $500; or
         (b)   On a private contract basis, in which case it shall be awarded
to the lowest and best bidder.
      (2)   The agents of the city are granted the right of entry on the
property for the removal of trash, mowing of weeds or grass or cleaning and
performance of necessary duties as a governmental function of the city.
Immediately following the cleaning or mowing of the property, the City Clerk
shall file a notice of lien with the County Clerk describing the property and
the work performed by the city and stating that the city claims a lien on the
property for the cleaning and mowing costs, and that such costs are the
personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date of filing of
the notice.
   (H)   After the property has been cleaned, the Administrative Officer shall
determine the actual cost of such cleaning and of any other expenses as may be
necessary in connection therewith, including the cost of the notice and
mailing. The City Clerk shall forward by mail to the property owner specified
in this section a statement of the actual cost and demanding payment.
   (I)   If payment is not made within 30 days from the date of the mailing of
the statement, the City Clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount
of the cost to the County Treasurer of the county in which the property is
located, and the same shall be levied on the property and collected by the
County Treasurer as other taxes authorized by law. The cost and the interest
thereon shall be a lien against the property from the date the cost is
certified to the County Treasurer and shall continue until the cost shall be
fully paid.
   (J)   At any time prior to the collection as provided herein, the city may
pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and the interest
thereon. Upon receiving payment, if any, the City Treasurer shall forward to
the County Treasurer a notice of such payment and directing discharge of the
lien or part thereof.
   (K)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property used
for agricultural purposes unless said property is determined by the
Administrative Officer to pose a health or safety hazard to adjoining
landowners and property.

Safety of the applicable state.

§ 131.15 CURFEW.
   (A)   This section shall be known and may be cited as the “Curfew Ordinance”
or “Regulation of the Presence and Conduct of Minors on Streets and Public
Places.”
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions apply
unless the context clearly requires a different meaning.
      MINOR. Any person under the age of 18.
      PARENT. Any person having legal custody of a minor as:
         (a)   A natural or adoptive parent;
         (b)   A legal guardian;
         (c)   A person who stands in loco parentis; or
         (d)   A person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the
Court.
      PUBLIC PLACE. Any street, alley, highway, sidewalk, park, playground or
place to which the general public has access and a right to resort for
business, entertainment or other lawful purposes. A PUBLIC PLACE shall include,
but not be limited to, any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley,
café, theater, drug store, pool room or shopping center and any other place
devoted to the amusement or entertainment of the general public. It shall also
include the front or immediate area of the above.
      REMAIN. To stand behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the
streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors)
totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using
the streets for ordinary or serious purposes, such as mere passage or going
home.
      STREET. A way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the
public as a matter of right for the purpose of vehicular travel or, in the case
of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term STREET includes the
legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the cartway or traffic
lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots
or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street.
      TIME OF NIGHT. Is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether
central standard time or central daylight saving time, generally observed at
that hour by the public.
      YEAR OF AGE. Continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth, to,
but not including the day of, the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making
it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the
phrase “under 18 years of age.”
   (C)   It is unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18) to be
or to remain in or upon the streets within the city at night during the period
ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
      (1)   At 10:00 p.m., for minors 15 years of age or younger;
      (2)   At 12:00 a.m., midnight, for minors more than 15 years of age on
Sunday through Thursday; and
      (3)   At 1:00 a.m. on Saturday morning and Sunday morning, for minors
more than 15 years of age.
   (D)   In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a city street during
the nocturnal hours for which division (C) above is intended to provide the
maximum limits of regulation shall not, however, be considered in violation of
this section:
      (1)   When accompanied by a parent of such minor;
      (2)   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor
to take the parent’s place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area;
      (3)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the U.S.
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by
possessing a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned by a
parent of such minor, with his or her home address and a telephone number,
specifying when, where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets at
night (during hours when division (C) above is otherwise applicable to the
minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such
communication;
      (4)   In cases of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in the
minor’s possession a written communication, signed by the minor and
countersigned by a parent of such minor, evidencing his or her home address and
a telephone number and establishing such reasonable necessity relating to
specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose, including
points of origin and destination;
      (5)   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or is on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating
an objection to the police officer;
      (6)   When returning home by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes
of the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or
voluntary association, provided that the minor has a written communication in
the minor’s possession, countersigned by a parent, indicting the home address
and a telephone number, the purpose for the event and when, where and in what
manner the minor will be on the streets at night;
      (7)   When authorized, by regulation issued by the City Council, in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adopted to
necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on
an individual special permit basis. Normally, such regulation by the City
Council permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance
to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies
such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
streets permitted, the period of time involved (not to extend more than 30
minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity) and the reason for
finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the
public interest and the purposes of this section;
      (8)   When the minor carries a certified card of employment, briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his or her home, his or her place of
employment and his or her hours of employment, or caries a valid proof of
employment, which may include the latest payroll receipt (not over 30 days
old); or
      (9)   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. This clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement
through the city, particularly on normal routes.
   (E)   (1)   It is unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor
knowingly to permit, or by inefficient control to allow, such minor to be or to
remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception
to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this section. The term KNOWINGLY includes
knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of a minor in that parent’s legal custody.
      (2)   It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents
up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an
objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was
completely indifferent to the activities, conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
   (F)   It shall be unlawful for any person operating or having charge of any
public place to knowingly allow, permit or suffer the presence of minors in
violation of the curfew established by this section.
   (G)   (1)   Upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the
streets in prima facie violation of this section, a police officer of the city
shall normally take the minor to the city’s police station, or other place
designated by the Police Chief, where a parent shall immediately be notified to
come for such minor, whereupon, they shall be interviewed. This is intended to
permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to
centralize responsibility in the personnel then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making
available experienced supervisory personnel, the best facilities and access to
information and records.
      (2)   In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate,
a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his or her best
judgment in determining age.
      (3)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the police officer may deliver to
a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example, a minor
of tender age near home whose identity may readily be ascertained or is known.
      (4)   In any event, such police officer shall, within 24 hours, file a
written report with the Police Chief. The report shall be treated for purposes
of juvenile records, in accordance with state statutes.
      (5)   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that, in accordance with police
regulations approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will, on
behalf of a parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
      (6)   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Police Chief shall
cause to be personally delivered to, or by certified mail send to, a parent a
written notice of violation with a warning that any subsequent violation shall
result in the full enforcement of this section, including the enforcement of
parental responsibility and of applicable penalties.

131.99
§ 131.16 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A MINOR.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions apply
unless the context clearly requires a different meaning.
      ANY PERSON. Any human being without regard to the legal or natural
relationship to a minor, as well as legal or corporate entities.
      MINOR. Any person under the age of 18 years.
   (B)   Any person who shall knowingly or willfully cause, aid, abet or
encourage a minor to be, to remain or to become a delinquent child, as defined
by state law, shall be guilty of an offense.

         (a)   It is the duty of any person having control of any premises who
knowingly hosts, permits or allows a gathering at said premises to take all
reasonable steps to prevent the consumption of alcoholic beverages by any minor

         (b)   It is unlawful for any person having control of any premises to

of alcoholic beverages that occurs exclusively between a minor and his or her
parent or legal guardian.
         (d)   Nothing in this division (B) shall be interpreted to prohibit
any family activity held in the confines of the family home from providing the
use of alcohol to immediate family members within the supervision of parents
and guardians. However, if a minor leaves such a family gathering intoxicated
and is found in public, then said providers of alcohol will be held responsible
in the same manner as a nonfamily gathering.
      (3)   Reservation of legal options.
         (a)   Violations of this division (B) may be prosecuted by the city
criminally, civilly or through both processes. The city may seek administrative
fees and response costs associated with the enforcement of this division (B)
through all remedies or procedures provided by statute, ordinance or law.
         (b)   This division (B) shall not limit the authority of peace

circumstances necessitating the application of this division (B).

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The legislature of the state has in 82 O.S. §§ 1601 through 1608, as
amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
ordinances designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city ordains the
following, to become effective immediately.
(Prior Code, § 12-400) (Ord. 2011-01, passed 1-3-2011)
§ 154.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affects
the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Prior Code, § 12-401) (Ord. 2011-01, passed 1-3-2011)
§ 154.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges, located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner so as to minimize future
flood-blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Prior Code, § 12-402) (Ord. 2011-01, passed 1-3-2011)
§ 154.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 12-403) (Ord. 2011-01, passed 1-3-2011)

(Prior Code, § 12-414) (Ord. 2011-01, passed 1-3-2011)
§ 154.28 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   (a)   The City Council may grant variances for uses which do not
satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act, being 82
O.S. §§ 1601 et seq., or this chapter if the applicant for the variance
presents adequate proof that:
            1.   Compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and
unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the
people; and
            2.   Satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section.
         (b)   However, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the
variance will be to permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably
creates flooding hazards.
      (2)   Any variance so granted shall not be construed so as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the State Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the state.
      (3)   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than 20
years.
      (4)   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the City
Council, accompanied by a filing fee as set by the city.
      (5)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, provided that the relevant factors in §
154.27(B) of this chapter and provisions of this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (6)   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Chairperson of the City
Council which states that:
         (a)   The cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than
the base flood elevation; and
         (b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
      (7)   At such time as the City Council deems the petition ready for
notification to the public, the City Council shall schedule a hearing and
direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
      (8)   The City Council shall conduct the hearing and make determinations
in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section. This appeals
group shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities involved and the
advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the public at large when
determining whether the variance shall be granted.
      (9)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances;
and
         (d)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (10)   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the
intent of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the
granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives stated in §
154.03 of this chapter.
      (11)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and a copy of any
variance issued by the City Council shall be sent by the Floodplain
Administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within 15 days after issuance of the
variance.
   (B)   Special provisions.
      (1)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use, provided that:
         (a)   The criteria of divisions (A)(5), (A)(9), (B)(2) and (B)(3)
above are met; and
         (b)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

   (A)   Plans and data to be submitted.
      (1)   Prior to submission of a request for a specific use permit, the
city may require one or more preapplication conferences with the potential
applicant.
      (2)   In considering and determining its recommendation to the City
Council relative to any application for a specific use permit, the Planning
Commission will establish the requirements necessary for consideration of the
application. The Commission shall also set a deposit amount from the applicant
sufficient for payment of the application and permit expenses. The requirements
and amount of deposit may be adjusted by the Planning Commission as necessary
during the application process.
      (3)   The city may require that the applicant furnish preliminary site
plans and data concerning the operation, location, function and characteristics
of any use of land or building proposed. For uses in which the land use has a
possible environmental impact, the Commission may require those engineering
and/or environmental impact studies necessary for evaluation of the proposed
use.
   (B)   Planning Commission; city requirements. The Planning Commission may
recommend to the City Council that certain safeguards and conditions concerning
bonding, insurance, setbacks, ingress and egress, off-street parking and
loading arrangements and the location or construction of buildings and uses and
operations be required. If the Planning Commission fails to review and make a
recommendation within 45 days from the date the application is accepted for
processing, the City Council can take action on the application.
   (C)   City Council requirements.
      (1)   The City Council may, in the interest of the public welfare and to
assure compliance with the intent of this chapter and the city’s Comprehensive
Plan, require such development standards and operational conditions and
safeguards as are indicated to be important to the welfare and protection of
adjacent property and the community as a whole and be compatible with the
natural environment and the planned capacities of public services and
facilities affected by the land use. This may include the requirement of having
the property platted and/or the requirement of the dedication of sufficient
rights- of-way or easements as necessary to further the public good.
      (2)   The City Council may impose conditions including, but not limited
to, bonding, insurance, permitted uses, lot sizes, setbacks, height limits,
required facilities, buffers, open space areas, lighting, noise levels,
signage, landscaping, parking and loading, compatibility and land use density
as may be indicated depending upon the proposed use and its potential effect on
adjacent areas or the community.
   (D)   Site plans. A site plan (plot plan) setting forth the conditions
specified may be required of the applicant, and such plan, when accepted, shall
be made a part of the permit issued for the specific use.
   (E)   Designation of zoning map. A specific use permit approved under the
provisions of this chapter shall not be considered as an amendment to the
zoning ordinance; however, the specific use permit shall be noted on the zoning
map as follows: SUP - (the number of the request for a specific use permit).
Any of the conditions contained in a specific use permit approval shall be
considered as conditions precedent to the granting of a building permit for the
specific use provided for.
   (F)   Time limits for implementation. If for any reason the approved
specific use ceases operation for a period of two years, then the approval of
said specific use shall be considered void and will require another public
hearing review by the Planning Commission and City Council. This shall also
apply to any approved specific use that does not begin operation within two
years of approval. This voiding of approval shall not apply if orderly progress
toward completion of construction is taking place. Uses existing before the
adoption of the specific use permit provisions, including nonconforming uses
and their incidental and accessory uses, must receive a specific use permit
before any expansion of the use is permitted.
