section 14-113. Payment of the cost of incarceration in such cases shall be
made by the city prisoner to the Okmulgee County criminal justice authority as
the public entity responsible for the operation of the county jail. To the
extent that the cost of incarceration of a city prisoner confined in the county
jail for a municipal offense is paid by a city prisoner to the Okmulgee County
criminal justice authority, the amount so paid shall offset and decrease the
amount of money, if any, owed by the city to the Okmulgee County criminal
justice authority for any cost of city prisoner incarceration.

confined in the city jail or county jail as a city prisoner, for any municipal

CHAPTER 2.09
AIRPORT DEPARTMENT
SECTION:
2.09.010: Public Works Director; Appointment; Supervision And Control
2.09.020: Powers And Duties
2.09.030: Wild Animal Control At The Airport
2.09.010: PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR; APPOINTMENT; SUPERVISION AND CONTROL:
There shall be an airport department, the head of which shall be the public
works director appointed by the city manager for an indefinite term, and
removable by the city manager. The public works director shall be an officer of

2.09.030: WILD ANIMAL CONTROL AT THE AIRPORT:
   A.   From time to time, wild animals of various types will move onto and
make use of the habitat contained within the Okmulgee Regional Airport grounds,
particularly as to areas on the perimeter of the grounds that are used
primarily as flight path, or as buffer areas for sound and for obstructive
height control. On occasion, some of those animals will venture closer to the
runways, becoming a collision hazard to airplanes and other vehicles at the
airport. It would therefore be helpful to reduce the population of such
animals, with particular reference to large game birds and to deer, in order to
reduce the threat posed by a potential collision with these animals. Therefore,
commencing with the 2010-2011 state bow hunting season, the city manager is
hereby authorized to adopt hunting regulations for the governance of municipal
employees who may choose to bow hunt on the grounds of the Okmulgee Regional
Airport. Said municipal regulations shall be in addition to any and all
requirements under applicable state law. As the effectiveness of this effort
and the necessity for the effort to continue cannot be determined in advance,
the city manager may not adopt regulations of this nature or implement a
program based thereon, prior to July of the fiscal year in which such
regulations and program will be implemented and effective; therefore the
program and the regulations must be adopted solely on a year by year basis.
   B.   As a result of the program and regulations for control of the
population of wild animals on airport property, any employee carrying an actual
permit issued hereunder, a valid Oklahoma hunting license and a photo ID issued
by any state, local, federal or tribal government, may carry and may use a bow,
arrows, and associated archery equipment while within airport property; and
such use shall be exempt from any prohibition against carrying weapons or
discharging projectiles as to such archery equipment, other ordinances to the
contrary notwithstanding. (Ord. 1961, 2010)

creditors, including utility companies, to adopt red flag policies to prevent
and mitigate identity theft with respect to covered accounts; and
Whereas the city of Okmulgee insofar as it offers water, sanitary sewer, solid

regulation and therefore is covered by this program and its requirements, so
that the city of Okmulgee is required to adopt this program on behalf of itself
and all of its public trusts; further the city of Okmulgee operates a municipal
court system which has accepted payment plans for the satisfaction of certain
penalties imposed at law, and such plans may contain some of the same types of

that the administrative rules entitled "identity theft prevention program"
dated April 9, 2009, attached to the ordinance codified herein, are hereby
adopted and approved effective this date. Provided that the city manager may

misdemeanor, the citation or ticket shall be properly verified if:
   A.   The issuing officer subscribes the officer's signature on the citation,
ticket or complaint to the following statement:
      I, the undersigned issuing officer, hereby certify and swear that I have
read the foregoing information and know the facts and contents thereof and that
the facts supporting the criminal charge stated therein are true.
Such a subscription by an issuing officer, in all respects, shall constitute a
sworn statement, as if sworn to upon an oath administered by an official
authorized by law to administer oaths; and
   B.   The citation or ticket states the specific facts supporting the
criminal charge and the ordinance or statute alleged to be violated; or
   C.   A complainant verifies by oath, subscribed on the citation, ticket or
complaint, that he has read the information, knows the facts and contents
thereof and that the facts supporting the criminal charge stated therein are
true. For purposes of such an oath and subscription, any law enforcement
officer of the state, county or municipality of the state of Oklahoma issuing

The arraignment shall be made by the court. The judge or city attorney shall
read the complaint to the defendant, inform him of his legal rights and of the
consequences of conviction, and ask him whether he pleads guilty or not guilty.
However, if the offense is one against the traffic ordinances of the city and
an accident resulted, the court shall not accept a plea of guilty. The city
council may prescribe a schedule of fines which the defendant may pay in lieu
of his appearance before the court and such payment shall constitute a final
determination of the cause against the defendant. (Ord. 1397 § 16, 1981)
2.80.150: ARREST; RELEASE BY SIGNING CITATION; BAIL AMOUNT AND CONDITIONS;
TEMPORARY CASH BOND:
   A.   Whenever a resident of the city is arrested for the violation of any
ordinance or charter provision, traffic or nontraffic, by a law enforcement
officer, the officer shall immediately release such person if he acknowledges
receipt of a citation by signing it unless it reasonably appears to the officer
that the person may cause injury to himself or others or damage property if
released or that the person will not appear in response to the citation. If
such person fails to appear in response to the citation a warrant shall be
issued for his arrest and his appearance shall be compelled.
   B.   Whenever a resident of the city is arrested by a law enforcement
officer for the violation of any ordinance or charter provision and is not
released by being permitted to sign the citation as provided in subsection A of
this section, he shall be admitted to bail either before or after arraignment,
or released on his own recognizance.
   C.   Whenever a nonresident of the city is arrested for a violation, other
than a traffic violation, by a law enforcement officer, the defendant shall be
eligible to be admitted to bail either before or after arraignment.
   D.   The city may require a person who is arrested for a municipal traffic
violation by a law enforcement officer to comply with the procedures provided
by law in 22 Oklahoma Statutes section 1114.1 for state traffic violations with
respect to the release of the arrested person and the methods of posting bail

motor vehicle which shall be recognized as an operator's license and shall
authorize the person's operation of a motor vehicle to the date of his hearing
but not to exceed twenty (20) days.
   E.   The amount and conditions of bail granted under subsections B and C of
this section shall be determined by the judge who shall prescribe rules for the
receipt of bail and for the release by recognizance. In the event of arrests at
night, or other emergency, or when the judge is not available, the chief of
police or his designated representative, and the city attorney, shall be
authorized by the judge under such conditions as shall be prescribed by the
judge to accept a temporary cash bond in a sufficient amount to secure the
appearance of the accused, but in no event shall the cash bond be more than the
maximum fine provided by ordinance for each offense charged. The chief of
police or his designated representative, and the city attorney are authorized
subject to such conditions as shall be prescribed by the judge to release a
resident of the city on his own recognizance. (Ord. 1397 § 17, 1981)
2.80.160: FAILURE TO APPEAR ACCORDING TO TERMS OF BOND; FORFEITURE:
If, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear according to the
terms and conditions of his bond, either for hearing, arraignment, trial or
judgment, or upon any other occasion when his presence in court or before the
magistrate may be lawfully required, the judge may direct that fact to be
entered upon the court minutes, thereby declaring the bond to be forfeited.
Without advancing court costs, the judge shall then cause the forfeiture to be
certified to the Okmulgee County district court, where it shall be entered upon
the district court judgment docket and shall have the same full force and
effect of a district court judgment. At such time as the forfeiture is entered
upon the district court judgment docket, the district court clerk shall proceed
in accordance with the provisions of 59 Oklahoma Statutes sections 1330 through
1333 and 1335. A surety shall have all remedies available under the provisions
of 22 Oklahoma Statutes section 1108 and 59 Oklahoma Statutes sections 1301
through 1340. Court costs shall be collectible from the proceeds of the bond.
If the city requires a person who is arrested for a city traffic violation by a
law enforcement officer to comply with the procedures provided in 22 Oklahoma
Statutes section 1114.1, then in the event, without sufficient excuse, a
defendant fails to appear, either for hearing, arraignment, trial or judgment
or upon any other occasion when his presence in court or before the magistrate
may be lawfully required, the judge may direct that fact to be entered upon the
court minutes, and direct the clerk to proceed as provided by 22 Oklahoma

(Ord. 1938 § 1, 2009)

3.08.010: AUTHORIZED DEPOSITORIES DESIGNATED:
The funds of the city shall be deposited or invested in an institution or
institutions that qualify as authorized investments of public funds under state
law, and: a) which are situated within the corporate limits of the city, or b)
which are affiliated under investment contracts, or deposit placement
agreements, or similar business alliances with institutions within the
corporate limits of the city. The funds received by the city shall be deposited
daily. (Ord. 1900 § 1, 2007: Ord. 1484 § 1, 1983: prior code § 311.1)
3.08.020: INSURANCE OR SECURITY:
The bank deposits of the city shall be protected and secured by the federal

under the security for local public deposits act, 62 Oklahoma Statutes, 1991,

3.08.040: COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT CAPITAL FUND:
The city of Okmulgee is in the process of selling block 139 original town of
Okmulgee, Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. This
property was originally acquired through the sale of general obligation bonds
which had been voted by the citizens of the city of Okmulgee. This is based
upon the Oklahoma constitution, article X section 19 states in part:
...every ordinance and resolution passed by any ...city ...levying a tax shall
specify distinctly the purpose for which said tax is levied, and no tax levied
and collected for one purpose shall ever be devoted to another purpose.
(Emphasis added.)
As such, the proceeds of the sale of the real estate are legally bound to be
used for a substantially similar purpose in light of the current and future
needs of the city of Okmulgee. It is clear that this legal requirement and
limitation on the use of the proceeds makes it necessary to establish a capital
account for the preservation of the principal and income generated by this
money. At the present time, the appropriate use has not been determined, but it
is clear that the money must be used to acquire, preserve, repair and maintain
a significant public benefit to the community generally, and may not be used
for ordinary administration and operation. Until such time as the city council
has determined an appropriate use for this money, the money shall be deposited
in an account dedicated exclusively to hold these proceeds, and then invested
in a reasonable and prudent manner with the income similarly placed in the same
account and subjected to the same restrictions. (Ord. 1962, 2010)

scale of rents, comparable rents, types of accommodations and services, number
of employees, or other factors. Written notice of such assessments shall be
given to the person liable for the collection and payment of the tax. Such
assessment shall finally and irrevocably fix and determine the tax unless the
person against whom it is assessed, within ninety (90) days after the giving of
notice of such assessment, shall apply in writing to the city council for a
hearing or unless the clerk upon the clerk's own initiative shall reassess the

initiative and the order of the clerk. Whenever a refund is made, the reasons
therefor shall be stated in writing. Such application may be made by the person
upon whom such tax was imposed and who has actually paid the tax. Such
application may also be made by the person who has collected and paid such tax
to the clerk provided that the application is made within ninety (90) days of
the payment by the occupant to the operator, but no refund of money shall be
made to the operator until he has repaid to the occupant the amount for which
the application for refund is made. The clerk, in lieu of any refund required
to be made, may allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.
   B.   Determination And Hearing: Upon application for a refund the clerk may
receive evidence with respect thereto, and make such investigation as the clerk
deems necessary. After making a determination as to the refund, the clerk shall
give notice thereof to the applicant. Such determination shall be final unless

3.32.010: CREATION OF A TAX INCREMENT FINANCING (TIF) DISTRICT:
The Council makes the following findings of fact:
   A.   The primary purpose of the Okmulgee Economic Development Project Plan,
and any amendments thereto, ("Project Plan") is to create a framework and a set
of financing authorizations that will bring about economic development, create
new jobs, reverse economic stagnation, stimulate private investment, enhance
the tax base, and improve the overall quality of life for the citizens of
Okmulgee (collectively, the "project"); and
   B.   The Project Plan supports the achievement of the economic development
objectives of the City of Okmulgee (the "City") and provides two (2) categories
of project activities ("project activities"), public improvements and economic
development incentives; and
   C.   Such project activities are necessary to assist with the construction
and financing assistance of public infrastructure improvements and provide
development financing assistance and job creation incentives, which will
encourage the development of underutilized and underdeveloped areas of the
City, serve as catalysts for retaining and expanding employment in the area,
attract major investment to the area, and preserve and enhance the tax base;
and
   D.   The project provides the mechanism necessary to make possible
investment, development and economic growth that would be difficult or
impossible without the project and the apportionment of tax revenues in
accordance with the Oklahoma Local Development Act, 62 Oklahoma Statutes
section 850, et seq., as amended (the "Local Development Act"); and
   E.   The Okmulgee Economic Development Review Committee, comprised of
representatives of each of the taxing jurisdictions in which the proposed
increment district is located, as well as representatives of the City, the
Planning Commission, and the public at large, has considered the financial
impacts of the project on each taxing jurisdiction and has found that any
adverse impacts are offset in view of the continuation of revenues from the
base assessed value of the proposed increment district and the economic
benefits of the development for the community as a whole, and has recommended
the approval of the proposed Project Plan, including proposed Increment
District No. 1, City of Okmulgee ("Increment District No. 1"), to the City
Council; and
   F.   The Okmulgee Planning and Zoning Commission has determined that the
Project Plan conforms with the Comprehensive (Master) Plan of the City of
Okmulgee and recommends to the City Council the approval of the Project Plan;
and
   G.   The Okmulgee Economic Development Review Committee has reviewed the
proposed project area and Increment District No. 1 in accordance with the
criteria specified in the Local Development Act and has determined that the
areas are eligible for designation as an increment district and for development
under the Local Development Act; and
   H.   Investment, development and economic growth are difficult, but
possible, within the proposed project area, as defined in section
3.32.060 of this chapter, and Increment District No. 1, if the Project Plan is
adopted; and
   I.   Tax apportionment financing is a necessary component in generating
economic development in the proposed project area and Increment District No. 1;
and
   J.   The apportioned increment revenues derived from Increment District No.
1 shall be used to finance eligible project costs contained in section VIII of
the Project Plan; and
   K.   The establishment of the proposed Increment District No. 1 will be used
in conjunction with existing programs and other locally implemented economic
development efforts in order to encourage economic development in the proposed
project area; and
   L.   The project will stimulate substantial new investment within Increment
District No. 1 and will generate additional indirect economic benefits outside
of Increment District No. 1 which would not occur without the project; and
   M.   The Project Plan provides tools which will supplement and not supplant
or replace normal public functions and services; and
   N.   The boundaries of the proposed Increment District No. 1 do not dissect
any similar area or create an unfair competitive advantage; and
   O.   Maximum effort has been made to allow full public knowledge and
participation in the application of the Local Development Act in review and
approval of the Project Plan, including Increment District No. 1; and
   P.   All required notices have been given and all required hearings have
been held in connection with the proposed Project Plan, as prescribed by the
Local Development Act, the Oklahoma Open Meetings Act, 25 Oklahoma Statutes
section 301, et seq., and other applicable law; and
   Q.   Implementation of the Project Plan will be carried out by the Okmulgee
Economic Development Authority and the Okmulgee Municipal Authority, both of
which are designated to assist in carrying out the Project Plan and to exercise
certain powers pursuant to the Local Development Act; and
   R.   Implementation of the Project Plan will be facilitated by authorizing
the Okmulgee Economic Development Authority to issue tax apportionment bonds or
notes and to incur project costs, as defined by the Project Plan, and to incur
the costs of issuance of such bonds and to accumulate appropriate reserves, if
any, in connection therewith; and
   S.   Implementation of the Project Plan will be facilitated by authorizing
the Okmulgee Economic Development Authority and Okmulgee Municipal Authority to
incur project costs, as defined by the Project Plan, and the Okmulgee Economic
Development Authority is authorized to reimburse the Okmulgee Municipal
Authority for such costs; and
   T.   The City retains the right, pursuant to the Local Development Act, to
make minor amendments to the Project Plan; and
   U.   It is in the best interest of the City and its citizens to approve the
Project Plan, including the establishment of Increment District No. 1. (Ord.
2126, 2019)

production, such as ephedrine products and pseudoephedrine products, in an area
of northeastern Oklahoma, principally focused on Tulsa County and the counties

their salts, their optical isomers, or salts of their optical isomers in any
form by an Oklahoma licensed physician or physician's assistant within the
physician's office, or any clinic, nursing home or other properly licensed
healthcare facility upon the orders of said authority.
   D.   Prescriptions; Refills: No prescription issued pursuant to this section
shall be filled or refilled more than six (6) months after the date such
prescription was issued, and no such prescription authorized to be refilled may
be refilled more than five (5) times.

this section shall be punished by a fine as specified in section

or his/her designee and receive a refund of the bond amount.
   C.   The owner shall pay the applicable pound fee and show evidence to the
animal control officer or his designee that the fee has been paid. The animal

dispose of all animals owned, kept, or harbored in accordance with state law.

the animal spayed/neutered within thirty (30) days. After the animal has been

shelter facility.
      2.   The animal may be adopted by private individuals upon the following
conditions:
         a.   Application of the required license for the animal, if the new
owner is a resident of the city of Okmulgee.
         b.   Written agreement that, if the animal is not already sterilized,
it will be sterilized within thirty (30) days for adult animals or by a
specified date for pups and kittens, that the animal will be vaccinated against
rabies within three (3) days for adult animals or within a specified date for

the city in charge of such animal or by the animal control officer, and shall
not be impounded in the animal shelter.
   C.   The animal control officer may euthanize any animal if it has been
surrendered to the animal shelter. The animal control officer or police officer
may destroy any animal that is so sick or injured that its cure is considered
by the animal control officer or police officer to be impracticable or if death
is imminent. In either of such events, such euthanization or destruction may be
done immediately, without notice or any waiting period. Anyone surrendering an
animal shall provide proof of his or her identity before the animal will be
accepted. (Ord. 1877 § 2, 2006)
6.20.080: RABIES CONTROL; ACTION:
   A.   Any rabies suspected animal shall be securely and separately confined
for observation for a period of ten (10) days. The confinement and observation
shall be at the Okmulgee animal shelter, or, at the discretion of the owner,
the animal may be confined in a veterinary hospital. Confinement at either
location and all veterinary charges including, if required, but not limited to,
euthanasia and/or lab analysis of animal remains for evidence of rabies shall
be at the owner's expense. Boarding kennels shall not be considered proper
confinement facilities. The owner must immediately surrender the rabies
suspected animal to the animal control officer or his designee. In the event
the owner wishes to have the animal held for observation at a veterinary
hospital, the animal will be transported to the veterinary hospital of the
owner's choice (within Okmulgee County) by a representative of the Okmulgee
animal shelter. Any person failing to surrender a rabies suspected animal, or
any person removing the rabies suspected animal from the city limits of
Okmulgee, is guilty of an offense. If, upon examination by a veterinarian, the
animal has no signs of rabies at the end of the impoundment period, it may be
released to the owner or, in case of a stray, it shall be disposed of in
accordance with applicable laws. In either event, the veterinarian shall make a
written report of the disposition of the animal to the city manager and the
animal control officer. At the end of the ten (10) day observation period, the
animal control officer, the city manager, or his designee shall notify any
person bitten by a rabies suspected animal whether such animal exhibited
symptoms or indications of rabies. If within the period of impoundment the
animal dies or exhibits symptoms or indications of rabies, it shall be examined
by a veterinarian for clinical diagnosis. Any animal diagnosed with rabies
shall then be properly euthanized by a veterinarian. The head of any rabies
suspected animal that dies shall be submitted to the state health department
laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis. In this event, the animal control
officer, the city manager, or his designee shall immediately notify any person
bitten of the diagnosis.
   B.   Any domestic dog or cat which is not effectively immunized against
rabies virus encephalitis and is exposed to rabies through an animal known to
be rabid shall be euthanized immediately by the veterinarian in charge or the
animal control officer in a manner which will preserve the head for analysis;
or such nonimmunized, rabies exposed dog or cat shall be strictly quarantined
and observed for a period of not less than six (6) months, and such animal
shall be immunized against rabies at least thirty (30) days prior to release.
Expenses for quarantine and immunization shall be borne by the owner or other
person responsible for the animal. (Ord. 1877 § 2, 2006)
6.20.090: APPREHENSION OF ANIMALS:
   A.   The animal control officer, police officer, or such other officer or
employee of the city as the city manager may authorize shall take into custody
and impound any animal running at large in violation of any provision of the
ordinances of the city, may enter upon the open premises of the owner or other
open private premises to take such animal into custody, and, if with reasonable
effort an animal illegally at large cannot be caught, may kill it, either on or
off private premises.
   B.   Notwithstanding any of the above provisions, should any dangerous
animal be found running at large constituting an immediate hazard to the
public's safety, and circumstances make the capture or seizure of such animal
impractical or impossible, or, should any animal found running at large elude
capture in spite of the exercise of reasonable efforts by responsible city
officials, then, in that event, such animal may be slain or destroyed by the
animal control officer or police officer using due regard for the safety and
welfare of the public in the selection of the method and manner of such
destruction or slaying.
   C.   It shall be an offense for any person within the city limits of the
city of Okmulgee to fail or refuse to deliver to the animal control officer
upon demand any unlicensed dog or cat, vicious animal, animal which is a
nuisance, rabies suspected animal, dog or cat found at large, or any animal the
keeping or harboring of which is declared to be an offense. (Ord. 1877 § 2,
2006)

may keep two dollars ($2.00) of the amount collected to offset bookkeeping and
other costs associated with this program. The veterinarian shall be required to

control and said records shall be turned over to the animal control officer on
a weekly basis along with the balance of the fees collected. The animal control
officer shall submit all fees collected to the finance department of the city
of Okmulgee along with copies of all forms submitted by the veterinarians.

It shall be unlawful and an offense for any property owner to allow trash to
accumulate, or weeds to grow or stand upon said property and each day's
accumulation of such offense shall be deemed a separate offense and shall be

(Ord. 1482 § 2, 1983; amd. Ord. 2135, 2020)
8.12.030: REMOVAL OF TRASH, WEEDS, AND UNPERMITTED TEMPORARY BUSINESS SIGNAGE
BY CITY; PROCEDURE:
The City Council may cause property within the City limits to be cleaned of
trash, weeds, unpermitted temporary business signage or grass to be cut or
mowed in accordance with the following procedure:
   A.   At least ten (10) days' notice shall be given to the owner of the
property by mail, at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the
County Treasurer's Office before the City Council holds a hearing or takes
action. The notice shall order the property owner to clean the property of
trash, remove unpermitted temporary business signage or to cut or mow the weeds
or grass on the property, as appropriate, and the notice shall further state
that unless such work is performed within ten (10) days of the date of the
notice the work shall be done by the City and a notice of lien shall be filed
with the County Clerk against the property for the costs due and owing the
City. At the time of mailing of notice to the property owner, the City shall
obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall
indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. If the
property owner cannot be located, notice may be given by posting notice on the
property or by publication, one time, not less than ten (10) days prior to any
action or hearing by the City Council. If summary abatement of a nuisance is
anticipated in accordance with subsection E of this section, the notice,
whether by mail, posting or publication, shall state that any accumulations of
trash, reoccurrence of unpermitted temporary business signage, or excessive
weed or grass growth on the owner's property occurring within six (6) months
from and after the date of this notice may be summarily abated by the City
Council; that the costs of such abatement shall be assessed against the owner;
and that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all
without further prior notice to the property owner.
   B.   The owner of the property may give his written consent to the City
authorizing the removal of the trash, unpermitted temporary business signage or
the mowing of the weeds or grass. By giving said written consent, the owner
waives his right to a hearing by the City Council.
   C.   A hearing may be held by the City Council, unless waived by the
property owner as hereinabove provided, to determine whether the accumulation
of trash, presence of unpermitted temporary business signage or the growth of
weeds or grass has caused the property to become detrimental to the health,
benefit and welfare of the public and the community or a hazard to traffic or
creates a fire hazard to the danger of property.
   D.   Upon a finding by the City Council that the property constitutes a
detriment or hazard, and that the property would be benefited by the removal of
such conditions, the agents of the City are granted the right of entry on the
property for the removal of trash, unpermitted temporary business signage,
mowing of weeds or grass, and performance of the necessary duties as a
governmental function of the City.
   E.   If a notice is given by the City Council to a property owner ordering
the property within the City limits to be cleaned of trash, unpermitted
temporary business signage removal and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in
accordance with the procedures provided for in subsection A of this section,
any subsequent accumulations of trash, recurrence of unpermitted temporary
business signage or excessive weed or grass growth on the property occurring
within a six (6) month period may be declared to be a nuisance and may be
summarily abated without further prior notice to the property owner. At the
time of each such summary abatement the City shall notify the property owner of
the abatement and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property
owner may request a hearing within ten (10) days after the date of mailing the
notice. The notice and hearing shall be as provided for in subsections A and C,
respectively, of this section. Unless otherwise determined at the hearing the
cost of such abatement shall be determined and collected as provided for in
section
8.12.040 of this chapter.
This subsection shall not apply if the records of the County Clerk show that
the property was transferred after notice was given pursuant to subsection A of
this section. (Ord. 2097, 2017)
8.12.040: DETERMINATION OF COST; BILLING; LEVY ON TAX ROLLS:
   A.   The City Council shall determine the actual cost of such cleaning and
mowing and any other expenses as may be necessary in connection therewith,
including the cost of notice and mailing. The City Clerk shall forward by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the property owner at the address
shown by the current year's tax rolls in the County Treasurer's Office a
statement of such actual cost and demanding payment. If the cleaning and mowing
are done by the City, the cost to the property owner for said cleaning and
mowing shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, maintenance and equipment
required. If the cleaning and mowing are done on a private contract basis, the
contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder.
   B.   Abatement of unpermitted temporary business signage may be performed by
City employees rather than private contract. Such abatements shall be set at a
fixed cost of twenty five dollars ($25.00) plus an administration fee of one
hundred twenty five dollars ($125.00); provided, however, the costs and fees
for abatement of unpermitted temporary business signage shall not become a lien
under subsection C of this section, but shall be subject to collection, and
shall be paid by the owner before future permits may be provided by the City.
   C.   If payment is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the
mailing of the statement, then within the next thirty (30) days, the City Clerk
shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the County
Treasurer and the same shall be levied on the property and collected by the
County Treasurer as other taxes authorized by law. The cost and the interest
thereon shall be a lien against the property from the date the cost is
certified to the County Treasurer, coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes
and all other taxes and special assessments and prior and superior to all other
titles and liens against the property, and the lien shall continue until the
cost shall be fully paid. At any time prior to collection, the City may pursue
any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon. Upon
receiving payment, if any, the City Clerk shall forward to the County Treasurer
a notice of such payment and directing discharge of the lien. (Ord. 2097, 2017;
amd. Ord. 2151, 2022)
8.12.050: DESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER; APPEALS TO CITY COUNCIL:
The City Council designates that any and all duties prescribed by sections
8.12.030 and
8.12.040 of this chapter to be performed by the City Council shall henceforth
be assumed and carried out by the Community Development Department. Provided,
that any aggrieved property owner shall have a right to appeal any order of the
Community Development Department to the City Council. Such appeal shall be
taken by filing written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within ten (10)
days after the administrative order is rendered. (Ord. 2017, 2014)
8.12.060: DETERMINATION OF ABATEMENT COSTS; COST STATEMENT TO BE SENT TO
PROPERTY OWNER:
   A.   Upon completion of the work ordered to be performed under this chapter,
the City Manager shall determine the cost thereof as to each tract. The costs
of abatement shall be presumed to be set at one hundred twenty five dollars
($125.00) for the investigation of the nuisance and the administration of the
process, over and above any expenses incurred under contract to abate the
nuisance. This cost has been legislatively determined to be generally accurate,
through an examination of the following cost factors:
      1.   The costs of labor expended by City officials charged with
inspections in the investigation, examination, and determination of public
nuisances.
      2.   The pro rata capital costs of vehicles used by City officials
performing the inspections.
      3.   Maintenance and repairs of vehicles, equipment, and tools used by
City officials in inspections.
      4.   Secretarial time and clerical time devoted to enforcement effort.
      5.   The costs of notice, including stationery, postage, and related
items.
      6.   The costs of photography.
      7.   Pro rata capital costs of equipment and tools used in the inspection
procedures.
      8.   Fuel for all related vehicles, equipment, and power tools.
      9.   Costs of clerical time expended in the collection by the City of the
costs of abatement from the landowners.
      10.   Costs of administering the program and supervising the employees
actually performing the inspection, evaluation, reporting, and clerical work.
      11.   Miscellaneous costs involved in the abatement process of the
property.
   B.   In the event the City Manager determines the standard charge is
inappropriate, the City Manager shall file a separate report with the City
Council, itemizing the costs for each such tract; the Council shall examine the
report and make a final determination of the total actual costs of work.
   C.   The City Clerk is hereby authorized to forward a statement of the
monies due and to demand payment thereof by certified mail with return receipt
requested, to the owner of the property at the address shown on the current tax
rolls in the Office of the Treasurer of the County in which the land is
located. (Ord. 1918 § 1, 2008)
8.12.070: CITATION FOR VIOLATION:
   A.   The City, by and through its Code Enforcement officer, may issue a
citation to the owner of property alleged to be in violation of this section.
Such citation may be issued prior to initiating proceedings for abatement, but
shall not preclude abatement if the violation is not remedied within thirty
(30) days of the issuance of the citation.
   B.   If the property in question has an active utility account with the City
or OMA, the officer shall mail, by first class mail a copy of the citation to
the owner of record and to any person listed on the utility account if it is
different from the record owner.
   C.   Said citation shall be issued in the same manner as other citations and
shall list a court date at least twenty (20) days from the date of the
citation.
   D.   The provisions of
Chapter 1.12 of this Code apply. (Ord. 2135, 2020)

8.28.020: ABATEMENT PROCEDURE:
   A.   Some public nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the public peace, health, safety, morals or welfare. It is
recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to require,
the city manager or other appropriate officer or agency of the city government
to take immediate and proper action to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or
suspend the danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such
abatement.
   B.   The chief of the fire department, the chief of police, the city
attorney, the city health officer, the building inspector, the electrical
inspector, the plumbing inspector, or any other officer subordinate to the city
manager, may submit, through or with the consent of the city manager to the
city council, a statement as to the existence of a public nuisance as defined
by the above section or by other sections of the ordinances of the city, and a
request or recommendation that it be abated. The city manager himself, any
councilman or any resident or residents of the city may submit such a statement
and request or recommendation to the city council.
   C.   The council shall determine whether or not the alleged public nuisance
is a public nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the
subject, the council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books,
papers and other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or to have it
abated, the council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to
the owner of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed
responsible for or to be causing the public nuisance, and an adequate
opportunity to be heard if such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be
given. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in
writing by mail or by service by a police officer if their name and addresses
are known; but if the names or addresses are not known, and the public peace,
health, safety, morals or welfare would not be unduly jeopardized by the
necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of
general circulation within the city.
   D.   If the council finds that a public nuisance does in fact exist, it
shall direct the owner and/or other persons responsible for or causing the
public nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the public interest

the event of infestation. Provided that periods of active demolition, cleanup,
and reconstruction shall not be considered as a time of violation, so long as
the work of demolition, cleanup, and reconstruction is reasonably continuous
and is performed on at least a weekly basis until complete.

barrier at least forty eight inches (48") (1219 mm) in height above the
finished ground level as measured on the side of the barrier away from the
pool. Gates and doors in such barriers shall be self- closing and self-
latching. Where the self-latching device is less than fifty four inches (54")

8.64.010: REFUSE SYSTEM:
That to provide a suitable, effective, and efficient system of garbage and
refuse storage and collection the following system is adopted.
   A.   1. The City shall furnish one polycart container to each residence or
family living unit located upon designated container routes, and sanitation
service shall be street side only. It shall be the responsibility of the
consumer to place the container on the street against the curb or the edge of
the street on the day and time designated for pick-up, and to remove the
container from street side on the same day following pick-up. Carry-out service
shall be provided to residents who are physically unable to place polycart
containers on the street. The City may require a doctor's certification of
physical limitation or disability prior to furnishing carry-out service.
      2.   The City shall work with commercial consumers to determine the
number of dumpsters needed and the level of service desired. Thereafter, the
City is to provide a dumpster in such quantity or quantities as agreed upon.
The dumpster shall be placed, and thereafter kept, at a location assigned by
the City. In the event a commercial consumer's needed level of service is
insufficient to justify the use of a dumpster, the consumer will be provided a
polycart as the refuse container. The sharing of dumpsters is prohibited, and
exceptions to this prohibition may be granted solely on the written approval of
the Public Works Director or his designee.
   B.   Polycart containers and dumpsters are, and shall remain, the exclusive
property of the City, and shall remain at the assigned location regardless of
changes in ownership or occupancy of the premises. The consumer shall be
responsible for damage to or loss of the polycart/dumpster provided for use by
the consumer, other than normal and reasonable wear and tear. Polycarts/
dumpsters that are lost, damaged or destroyed through neglect, abuse or
improper use of the consumer shall be repaired or replaced by the City at the
expense of the consumer, and such expense shall be added or billed to the
consumer's utility bill. The billing for such repair or replacement may be had
by lump sum on a single monthly utility billing, or may be prorated with
installment payments over several utility billing periods, but not to exceed
twelve (12) months, at the option of the City and if it appears a lump sum
billing would create a substantial hardship.
   C.   Where polycarts are provided by the City, consumers shall use the
polycarts as their first means of disposing of refuse. An additional charge,
equal to one month's service, will be added to the consumer's utility bill for
each special pick-up provided.
   D.   Consumers other than single-family living units may be served by
polycarts, multiple polycarts, or may be served by commercial type dumpsters
furnished by the City and placed by the City at selected locations on or in the
immediate vicinity. The decision as to which type service shall be provided
shall be exclusively that of the City.
   E.   It shall be the duty of each person utilizing the refuse system to
deposit all garbage and trash from such person's premises in the polycarts and/
or dumpsters as provided by the City for collection, and to keep the polycarts/
dumpsters in a sanitary condition that does not jeopardize public health and
safety. Every person placing garbage or small items of trash in any container
provided by the City shall drain all liquids from such garbage and trash and
bag or contain it in some manner before placing it in such container. It shall
be the duty of each person utilizing the refuse system to provide a suitable
closable container for the disposal of hypodermic syringes, needles, and other
items of refuse capable of causing injury during normal pick up and handling by
the sanitation workers. Such containers shall be adequate to prevent the
needles or any sharp edges from penetrating the external surface of the trash
bag during pick up.
   F.   It is unlawful to place large domestic items, including, but not
limited to, television sets, computer monitors and central processing units,
copiers, fax machines, wood, tree limbs, furniture, major appliances, tires,
and cable, in dumpsters or polycarts. It is unlawful to place flammable or
hazardous materials including, but not limited to, flammable liquids or gases,
oil, batteries, and paint in dumpsters or polycarts.
   G.   Consumers can obtain the use of additional polycarts upon payment of a
fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). Provided, that a single family living unit may
not have more than three (3) polycarts in use.
   H.   It is unlawful and a misdemeanor to place refuse of any type in the
polycart or dumpster of another consumer without the specific authorization of
that consumer.
   I.   It is unlawful to place lumber, furniture, or major appliances in
polycarts or dumpsters as a part of routine refuse pick up; however, consistent
with the City of Okmulgee's recycling policy, lumber, furniture, and certain
major appliances may be placed curbside for a monthly "bulky item" pick up
service provided by the Public Works Department when the person responsible for
the residential account has first called public works to arrange for the
special pick up. This service is limited to no more than four (4) "bulky item"
pick ups per residential account holder in any calendar year, and each pick up
is limited to not more than three (3) bulky items. Commercial accounts are not
eligible for "bulky item" pick ups. (Ord. 2121, 2018: Ord. 1980, 2011: Ord.

provided by this chapter, or the accumulation of garbage or trash by reason of
nonpayment of fees or charges for its removal, is hereby declared to be a

in accordance with the schedule listed therein, and shall be computed at the
appropriate rate for the corresponding time period multiplied by eighty percent
(80%) of the number of multi-family living units so served so as to allow for
vacant units.
   C.   All consumers served by dumpsters shall pay a fee for each dumpster
multiplied by the number of collections per week picked up during the billing

shall have authority to negotiate a sanitation contract with any establishment
or concern which has twenty (20) or more refuse containers in service, or which
has more than sixty (60) cubic yards of refuse for removal per day; any
contract so negotiated is subject to the approval of the City Council.
   E.   Billing for the sanitation charge shall be made on the monthly water
bills of the City to the water account which provides water service for the
family living unit, establishment or concern which receives the garbage and
refuse removal, and payment shall be due from, and the responsibility and
obligation of, the holder or owner of said water account. Payment of said
charge shall be governed by and subject to the terms, conditions, penalties and

other concern which receives garbage and refuse collection by the City not be a
water user, the City Manager shall cause suitable billing and statement
procedures to cover such person, establishment or other concern.
   F.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, residential
consumers of the garbage and refuse collection system that are located outside

other than the regularly scheduled pick-up time shall have a fee equal to one
month's service added to the consumer's utility bill for each such special
pick-up. Consumers receiving dumpster service who request a special pick-up at
a time other than the regularly scheduled pick-up time shall have a fee equal
to one month's single dumpster, single pick-up service added to the consumer's

of other tobacco products in the buildings or on the grounds of the facility.
   D.   A private residence is not a "public place" within the meaning of the
smoking in public places and indoor workplaces act except that areas in a

places and indoor workplaces act.
   E.   Smoking is prohibited on all real property owned in fee by the city,
including all public parks and playgrounds, all public buildings and all public
parking lots. This shall not be interpreted to prohibit smoking on the

is fully enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside in such manner that no
smoke can drift or circulate into a nonsmoking area. No exhaust from a smoking
room shall be located within fifteen feet (15') of any entrance, exit or air
intake. If smoking is to be permitted in any space exempted in subsection G of
this section or in a smoking room pursuant to subsection H of this section,
such smoking space must either occupy the entire enclosed indoor space or, if
it shares the enclosed space with any nonsmoking areas, the smoking space shall
be fully enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside with no air from the
smoking space circulated to any nonsmoking area, and under negative air
pressure so that no smoke can drift or circulate into a nonsmoking area when a
door to an adjacent nonsmoking area is opened. Air from a smoking room shall
not be exhausted within fifteen feet (15') of any entrance, exit or air intake.
   G.   This section shall not prohibit smoking in:
      1.   Stand alone bars, stand alone taverns or cigar bars;
      2.   The room or rooms where licensed charitable bingo games are being
operated, but only during the hours of operation of such games;
      3.   Up to twenty five percent (25%) of the guestrooms at a hotel or

immediate family of the owner or operator, performs any work in the workplace,
and the workplace has only incidental public access;
      6.   Workplaces occupied exclusively by one or more smokers, if the
workplace has only incidental public access. "Incidental public access" means

code, 26 USC section 501(c)(8), 501(c)(10) or 501(c)(19), when such facility is
utilized exclusively by its members and their families and for the conduct of
post or organization nonprofit operations except during an event or activity
which is open to the public;

not be allowed within fifteen feet (15') of any exterior public doorway or any
air intake of a restaurant; and

the research or treatment.
   H.   Restaurants shall be totally nonsmoking or may provide nonsmoking areas
and designated smoking rooms. Food and beverage may be served in such
designated smoking rooms which shall be in a location which is fully enclosed,
directly exhausted to the outside, under negative air pressure so smoke cannot
escape when a door is opened, and no air is recirculated to nonsmoking areas of
the building. No exhaust from such room shall be located within twenty five
feet (25') of any entrance, exit or air intake. Such room shall be subject to
verification for compliance with the provisions of this subsection by the state
department of health. (Ord. 2023, 2014: Ord. 1924 § 1, 2008)

The use of tobacco in any form in which it is chewed or ingested is prohibited
on all real property owned in fee by the city, including all public parks and

tobacco in any form in which it is chewed or ingested is also prohibited within
all public vehicles and within all public buildings, which are owned by the

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for removal of graffiti
from surfaces on public or private property in order to reduce blight and
deterioration within the incorporated areas of the city and to protect the
public health and safety. The city council hereby makes the following findings:
   A.   Unsightly graffiti on public and private property within the city is
detrimental to the beauty of our community;
   B.   Graffiti on public and private property within the city is often
related to criminal street gang activity, with graffiti being used to convey
information to gang members and mark gang territory;
   C.   Gang related graffiti often provides a catalyst for gang related
criminal violence within the city;
   D.   Gang related graffiti constitutes a growing blight on and a substantial
detriment to the health and safety of the residents of our community;
   E.   Even when graffiti is not gang related, it still contributes to the
deterioration of property values in the area; and
   F.   By reason of the foregoing findings, graffiti constitutes a public
nuisance to our community. (Ord. 2034, 2014)
8.75.010: DEFINITIONS:

8.75.000 of this chapter:
   GRAFFITI: Any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, picture, or design
that is sprayed, marked, posted, pasted or otherwise affixed, drawn, or painted
on any surface of public or private property. Graffiti shall not mean a sign as
defined in this code or the ordinances of the city. This chapter shall not be
construed to prohibit easily removable chalk markings on public sidewalks and
streets such as the markings used in connection with traditional children's
games. This chapter shall not be construed to prohibit commercial advertising
on commercial property or artistic murals, either of which are actually
commissioned in advance by the owner of the property; provided that the
existence of such a commission is an affirmative defense of the owner in any
graffiti abatement action under this chapter.
   RESPONSIBLE PERSON: Person responsible for causing or maintaining a public
nuisance or a violation of this code or applicable state codes. The term
includes, but is not limited to, a property owner, tenant, person with a legal

for more than twenty (20) days upon any surface within that person's control,
possession, or ownership when the graffiti is visible from a public street,
property or right of way after being notified by the city that such graffiti
exists. (Ord. 2034, 2014)
8.75.040: GRAFFITI REMOVAL STANDARDS:
   A.   When graffiti is painted over, the color used to paint over the
graffiti shall be similar to the original color of the surface, or the surface
shall be completely repainted with a new color which is aesthetically
compatible with existing colors and architecture.
   B.   The removal shall not leave shadows and shall not follow the pattern of
the graffiti such that letters or similar shapes remain apparent on the surface
after graffiti markings have been removed.
   C.   If the area is heavily covered with graffiti, the entire surface is to
be repainted.
   D.   Graffiti shall be removed or covered completely in a manner that
renders it inconspicuous. (Ord. 2034, 2014)

   A.   The code enforcement officer may cause property within the municipal
limits to be cleaned of graffiti in accordance with the following procedure:

property by mail at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the
county treasurer's office: and notice, if applicable, shall be given to the
tenant inhabiting the property; such notices shall be given before the Code
Enforcement Officer takes action. The notice shall order the property owner to
abate the graffiti as defined in section
8.75.040 of this chapter, and the notice shall further state that unless such
work is performed within twenty (20) days of the date of the notice the work
shall be done by the City of Okmulgee Employees or agents of the City are
granted the right of entry on the property for the abatement of graffiti and
performance of the necessary duties as a governmental function of the City of
Okmulgee, so long as these employees or agents do not have to remove a locked
gate or enter an enclosed structure.
      2.   At the time of mailing of notice to the property owner and tenant
(if applicable), the code enforcement officer shall obtain a receipt of mailing
from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and

be taken within ten (10) days from the date of the administrative officer's
notice by filing with the city clerk a written request for hearing specifying
the grounds thereof. Failure to request a hearing within the ten (10) day
period will act as a waiver of the property owner's right to a hearing by the
city council, and may result in the city of Okmulgee abating the property.
   B.   A request for hearing stays all further actions concerning graffiti on
that property by the code enforcement officer.
   C.   The city council shall hear the matter and receive information thereon,
including anything which may be presented by the owner of the premises,
personally or by agent or attorney. The city council may affirm, reverse or
modify the notice or order of the code enforcement officer.
   D.   If the city council determines that the condition specified in section
8.75.030 of this chapter exists upon such premises, it shall order the property
to be cleaned of any graffiti necessary to abate the condition found to exist.

detriment or hazard, and that the property would be benefited by the removal of
such conditions, the employees or agents of the City of Okmulgee are granted
the right of entry on the property for the abatement of graffiti and
performance of the necessary duties as a governmental function of the City of
Okmulgee. (Ord. 2034, 2014; amd. Ord. 2131, 2020)

be let by contract to the lowest and best bidder, in the manner for letting
other contracts by public bid. (Ord. 2034, 2014; amd. Ord. 2131, 2020)

This will be determined by the records on file with the Okmulgee County clerk.
A property transfer for estate planning purposes only shall not affect the
priority ranking of an application, but any other transfer shall cause the
applicant to lose priority on the list. Said list of applications shall then be
evaluated by Okmulgee state park and a city of Okmulgee representative and a
recommendation for approval or denial of the application will be submitted to
the Okmulgee city council for action at a city council meeting.
      3.   In the event the number of qualified applications received exceeds
the number of available permits, the excess applications shall be retained and
will serve as a waiting list for future available permits subject to the same
priority criteria as stated above. Applicants submitting their application
after the initial application period shall be placed on the waiting list in the
appropriate priority based on time of ownership or lease, relative to all other
applicants on the waiting list.
      4.   In the event someone on the waiting list sells his/her property, the
priority position on the waiting list is not transferable. The new property
owner must submit a new application and will be assigned the appropriate
priority ranking on the list based on their date of acquisition.

structure will be required to be removed within a period of time set by the
city manager. If the structure is not removed within said period of time, the

permit holder. The revoked permit shall then be deemed to be an available
permit and be offered to the next person on the waiting list. Any person having
had a previous permit revoked shall be eligible to submit a new application and
be placed at the bottom of the waiting list.
   D.   Eligibility: To be eligible to submit an application for a boat dock/
lake access permit, a person must either lease property from the city of

shall be the duty of the city manager immediately to give notice by publication
to the water consumers of the system not to use water obtained from the system
for any purpose other than for strictly domestic use and such other use as he
may designate, so long as the water shortage lasts. Thereafter and until he
proclaims the emergency at an end, it is unlawful for any person, firm or

Manager stating the location and other pertinent data required. The City Water
and Sewer Department shall then make the necessary survey and recommend the
size pipe required for the extension or replacement of the main. The interested
parties shall then enter into a contract with the City which will require the
property owners to put up the estimated amount of the total cost of such main
extension or replacement with the City and the City shall have direct
supervision of the work. All materials shall meet City Water and Sewer
Department specifications. The City may, at its option, choose to accomplish
the project by contract.
   B.   When the job is complete, a final bill shall be made of design and
related costs, labor, equipment, and material used, or, if the project is
accomplished by contract, of the design and related costs and contract amount.
Any difference in cost over the deposit shall be made up by the property
owners. If the total cost is below the amount of the deposit, the difference
shall be refunded to the property owners, and the pipe will then become the

13.04.280: WATER BILL; UTILITY CHARGE; BILLING AND PAYMENT, CONDITIONS AND
PENALTIES; USE OF WATER DEPOSIT:
Billing for the water charge shall be made on the monthly water bills of the
City to the water account which provides water service for the family living
unit, establishment or other concern which is served by the water system. In
addition to the water charge, the water bill shall include thereon the
stormwater utility fee, the ambulance service charge, the sanitation charge,
and the sanitary sewer charge, including any service or delinquency charges as
may hereinafter be imposed by the terms of this title. All of the various
charges included on the water bill, as above set out, shall be referred to
collectively as the "utility charge", and the following shall apply to the
billing and payment of said utility charge:
   A.   The utility charge shall be due and payable on or before the due date
as shown on the water bill.
   B.   Except as provided in this subsection partial payments of the utility
charge will not be accepted after the cutoff date set forth in subsection D of
this section. Provided, however, that the City Council in the event of any
unforeseen occurrence causing, or expected to cause, a substantial increase in
the total amount of any one month's utility billing, may by resolution provide
that the individual bills within said billing period may be paid by
installments over an extended period, never to exceed three (3) months, and
shall prescribe a different due date for said single billing period.
   C.   Payment of the utility charge by a check which is subsequently returned
for any reason, shall result in a twenty five dollar ($25.00) returned check
service charge. This amount plus the amount of the original check and any
accumulated penalties must be paid prior to restoration of service.
   D.   In the event the utility charge is not paid in full by the due date
shown thereon, a delinquency charge of fifteen percent (15%) of the unpaid
balance shall be added to the utility charge. In the event the utility charge
is not paid in full by the expiration of five (5) days after the due date, the
water connection may be cut off by the City. Provided, that the City shall not
attach a late charge on any bill of another governmental entity or public trust
until a thirty (30) day period has elapsed from the issuance of said bill; that
after the elapse of said thirty (30) days without the utility charge being paid
a delinquency charge of fifteen percent (15%) of the unpaid balance shall be
added to the utility charge; and in the event the utility charge is not paid in
full by the expiration of forty (40) days after issuance of the bill, the water
connection may be cut off by the City.
   E.   When a utility account is placed on the delinquent list for the
nonpayment of any utility charge, there will be charged and collected by the
City, in addition to the amount of the past due utility charge and any other
service charges, an additional sum of thirty dollars ($30.00) for being placed
on the delinquent list and/or disconnection of service. In the event that there
has been a history of unauthorized connection to or opening of valves
associated with the meter on the applicable service account, then the City may
remove the meter and place an additional service charge of sixty five dollars
($65.00) on the account for that service; such service charge shall not be made
if a completely new account is created by a new consumer who is not the old
account holder nor a family member or roommate of the old account holder. The
total sum of charges due must be paid in full prior to reconnection. Provided
that if the account holder has never previously been placed on the delinquent
list, and if the delinquency was caused by a financial event unlikely to
reoccur in the normal life of the account holder, the utility billing office
shall have the authority to waive the thirty dollar ($30.00) fee on a single
occasion.
   F.   Adjustments to water service charges shall be made only when: 1) a
faulty meter has given an inaccurate reading; 2) improper reading of a meter
has resulted in an improper charge; or 3) a newly discovered leak is found that
is not attributable to the actions or omissions of the property owner, and
which results in a charge that is at least three hundred percent (300%) of the
average bill for water usage at that property over the immediately preceding
three (3) months. No more than one adjustment will be made to an account in any
twelve (12) consecutive month period, and no more than one month's bill shall
be adjusted on any account. All adjustments on the water bill shall require
payment of the average bill over the preceding three (3) months, plus fifty
percent (50%) of any discrepancy that is not caused by the City or its agents.
This adjustment shall be in lieu of any adjustment to the sanitary sewer
charges which may be given due to discrepancies in the water bill, at the
customer's option.
   G.   For a utility account holder whose water service is provided by a
provider other than the City of Okmulgee, in the event the account has been
placed on the delinquent list for the nonpayment of any utility charge, the
following actions may be taken in addition to action specified in subsection E
of this section:
      1.   The account holder's sanitary sewer service line will be
disconnected from the City's sanitary sewer main and plugged. The expense of
that work will be added to the account holder's utility account.
      2.   The account holder's water provider will be notified that the water
service should be discontinued in accordance with Oklahoma Department of
Environmental Quality (ODEQ) requirements unless the property owner has
connected the facility's sewer system to a septic system or other approved
sewer system which was installed by an ODEQ approved installer.
      3.   Reconnection of the property's sanitary sewer service line to the
City of Okmulgee's sanitary sewer system will be allowed only if the City
Manager gives approval and the following actions are accomplished:
         a.   All past due amounts are paid in full to the City by the property
owner.
         b.   The current sanitary sewer tap fee for connection to the City's
sanitary sewer system is paid to the City by the property owner.
         c.   The property owner has a licensed plumber accomplish the
reconnection of the private sanitary sewer main at the property owner's
expense. (Ord. 2031, 2014: Ord. 2009, 2013: Ord. 1991, 2012: Ord. 1977, 2011)

considerable outlay of funds for maintenance and operation; such outlay is a
recurring expense to the City.

been borne by the proceeds received from the operation of other public
utilities and other sources of income other than from the sanitary sewage
system.
   C.   Cities in the State of Oklahoma have such authority as is granted by
the Legislature of the State as the same relates to the raising of funds with
which to furnish services to their citizens.

share of the cost of administration of the City, as well as the cost of its own
operation, and a reasonable profit.

utilities must be paid into the General Fund of the City and spent under
budgets. (Ord. 1977, 2011)

In case of a new account where no average can be determined, the City Clerk or
the Clerk's designee shall determine a figure based on normal usage of other
similar accounts, to be used in computing the July, August, and September
billing period's sanitary sewer charge. In the event an account is serviced by
a water meter and none of the water consumed is discharged to, or returnable
to, the City sanitary sewer system, and if the consumer so elects, said account
will not be subject to the sanitary sewer charge.
   G.   Adjustments To Sanitary Sewer Charge: Adjustments to the sanitary sewer
charge shall be had and allowed in the same manner and upon the same conditions
as adjustments to water service charges as provided by subsection
13.04.280F of this title. Further, in the event that a consumer shall have a
water leak resulting in a high water usage, the consumer, upon having such
condition certified by an Oklahoma licensed plumber who is registered with the
City, shall be entitled to an adjustment for one billing period; said

contracts under the authority of subsection E of this section. In the event
that a new sewer service consumer hereafter wants to begin service, but is not
on the City's water utility, such a consumer shall be required to post a
deposit at the time of application for the following sums:
      1.   For a residence, house, apartment or office, the sum of one hundred

($150.00) or three (3) month average of previous occupant's usage;
      3.   For a private club, beer hall or place of amusement, the sum of two
hundred dollars ($200.00);

consumer applying for an account has previously held an account with the City,
and said applicant has in the past established a bad credit history with the
City by having on three (3) occasions either paid the amount with a check which
was dishonored by the bank on which it was drawn, or has not paid the account
by the due date of payment, the City shall require a deposit equal to one-
fourth (1/4) of the estimated yearly utility charge, as that term is defined in
section
13.04.280 of this title, as determined by the Utility Billing Supervisor, if
that amount so computed is greater than the standard deposit required for such
consumer as set forth in subsections A through C of this section. Further, if a
consumer with an existing account has established a bad credit history with the
City, as above set forth, said consumer will be required to increase the
existing deposit to an amount equal to one-fourth (1/4) of the annual utility
charge of said consumer, if the amount so computed is greater than the standard
deposit required for said consumer, and the failure to pay the increased
deposit shall give the City authority to refuse sewer service to such consumer
as if the consumer had failed to pay the utility charge itself. (Ord. 2196,

13.32.050: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
No industrial user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any
pollutant or wastewater which causes pass-through or interference. These
general prohibitions apply to all industrial users of the POTW whether or not
they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national,
state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. Furthermore, no
industrial user may contribute the following substances to the POTW:
   A.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal
wastewater collection and POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams
with a closed cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit
(140°F) (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
   B.   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0, or otherwise causing
corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment, or endangering city
personnel.
   C.   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of
the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case solids greater
than one-half inch (1/2") in any dimension.
   D.   Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen demanding
pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants,
will cause interference with either the POTW or any wastewater treatment or
sludge process, or which will constitute a hazard to humans or animals.
   E.   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment
plant to exceed one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (104°F) (40°C).
   F.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil
origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through.
   G.   Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.
   H.   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated
by the city in accordance with section
13.32.140 of this chapter.
Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a
manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located in
process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's
pretreatment facility before connecting with the POTW. (Ord. 1807 § 1, 2002:
Ord. 1691 § 6, 1992)
13.32.060: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I,
subchapter N, parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated. (Ord. 1691 § 7,
1992)
13.32.070: SPECIFIC POLLUTANT LIMITATIONS:
The city will adopt the concentration based limits presented in the
"Technically Based Local Limits" document as the general discharge limits to
protect against pass-through and interference at the POTW. The limits apply at
the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations
for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The
city manager may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the
concentration based limitations above. (Ord. 1975, 2011)
13.32.080: CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION:
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section
13.32.010 of this chapter or the general and specific prohibitions in section
13.32.050 of this chapter. (Ord. 1691 § 9, 1992)
13.32.090: SPECIAL AGREEMENT:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial
users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In
no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard
or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment
to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also
request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a
request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors
relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors
considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial
user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the
procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13. (Ord. 1691 § 10, 1992)
13.32.100: DILUTION:
No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city
manager may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 1691 § 11,
1992)
13.32.110: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:

comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical
pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in section
13.32.050 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the
state, or the city manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1691 § 12, 1992)
13.32.120: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLANS:
The city manager may require any industrial user to develop and implement an
accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two (2) years the
city manager shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such
a plan. Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental
discharge/control slug plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum,
the following:
   A.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges.
   B.   Description of stored chemicals.
   C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug
discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would
violate any of the prohibited discharges in section
13.32.050 of this chapter.
   D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site run off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response. (Ord. 1691 § 13, 1992)
13.32.130: TENANT RESPONSIBILITY:
Where an owner of property leases premises to any other person as a tenant
under any rental or lease agreement, if either the owner or the tenant is an
industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1691 § 14, 1992)
13.32.140: HAULED WASTEWATER:
   A.   Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at a designated
receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such times as are
established by the city manager, provided such wastes do not violate sections
13.32.050 to
13.32.100, inclusive, of this chapter or any other requirements established or
adopted by the city. Wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to
use such facilities shall be issued by the city manager.
   B.   The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as "industrial septage"
requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from the city. The
city manager shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of such wastes, if
such disposal would interfere with the treatment plant operation. Waste haulers
are subject to all other sections of this chapter.
   C.   Fees for dumping septage will be established as part of the industrial
user fee system. (Ord. 1691 § 15, 1992)

or equipment, or other part of the POTW. (Ord. 1691 § 16, 1992)
13.32.160: WASTEWATER SURVEY:
When requested by the city manager all industrial users must submit information
on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater by completing a
wastewater survey prior to commencing their discharge. The city manager is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require
industrial users to update the survey. Failure to complete this survey shall be
reasonable grounds for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be
considered a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 1691 § 17, 1992)
13.32.170: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT; REQUIREMENT:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to discharge
wastewater into the city's POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge
permit from the city manager. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions hereinafter set
out. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of
its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or
requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law.
   B.   The city manager may require other industrial users, including liquid
waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out
the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 1691 § 18, 1992)
13.32.180: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE; PERMITTING NEW CONNECTIONS:
Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging
industrial wastes into the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior
to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this
wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least ninety (90) days prior to
the date upon which any discharge will begin. (Ord. 1691 § 19, 1992)

not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
      7.   Compliance Schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the
industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set by this chapter.
      8.   All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with section
13.32.210 of this chapter. (Ord. 1691 § 31, 1992)
13.32.310: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE PROGRESS REPORT:
The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by subsection
13.32.300B7 of this chapter. The schedule shall contain progress increments in
the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading
to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include hiring
an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and
conducting routine operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine
(9) months. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the city
manager no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, (and, if
appropriate) the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the
established schedule. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse
between such progress reports to the city manager. (Ord. 1691 § 32, 1992)
13.32.320: REPORT ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD
DEADLINE:
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, an industrial
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the city a report containing the information described in subsections
13.32.300B4, B5 and B6 of this chapter. For industrial users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure
of the industrial users long term production rate. For all other industrial
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual production
during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with section
13.32.210 of this chapter. (Ord. 1691 § 33, 1992)
13.32.330: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS:
   A.   Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard
shall, at a frequency determined by the city manager but in no case less than
twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with section
13.32.210 of this chapter.
   B.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in
good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   C.   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of
this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW,
using the procedures prescribed in section
13.32.400 of this chapter the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report. (Ord. 1691 § 34, 1992)
13.32.340: REPORT OF CHANGED CONDITIONS:
Each industrial user is required to notify the city manager of any planned
significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days
before the change.
   A.   The city manager may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
section
13.32.200 of this chapter.
   B.   The city manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section
13.32.220 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under section
13.32.260 of this chapter.
   C.   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s)
until and unless the city manager has responded to the industrial user's
notice.
   D.   For purposes of this requirement flow increases of ten percent (10%) or
greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be
deemed significant. (Ord. 1691 § 35, 1992)
13.32.350: REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
   A.   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW
(including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section
13.32.050 of this chapter), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
   B.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial user
shall, unless waived by the city manager, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter.
   C.   Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be
deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
   D.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of
a discharge described in subsection A of this section. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure. (Ord. 1691 § 36, 1992)
13.32.360: REPORTS FROM NONSIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS:
All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the city as the city manager may require. (Ord. 1691 § 37, 1992)
13.32.370: NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
industrial user must notify the control authority within twenty four (24) hours
of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs
monitoring at the industrial user's at least once a month, or if the POTW
performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the
industrial user receives the results of this sampling. (Ord. 1691 § 38, 1992)
13.32.380: NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   A.   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste
shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and
state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of
a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under
40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type
of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges
more than ten (10) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the industrial user, an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste
stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following
twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred
eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section
13.32.340 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does
not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements
of sections
13.32.300, 13.32.320, and 13.32.330 of this chapter.
   B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection A of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.
   C.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety
(90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree determined to be
economically practical. (Ord. 1691 § 39, 1992)
13.32.390: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part
of wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA. (Ord. 1691 § 40, 1992)
13.32.400: SAMPLE COLLECTION:
   A.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, twenty four
(24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the permit. Where time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized, the sampling must be representative of
the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four
(24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized, as appropriate.
   B.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90)
day compliance reports required in sections
13.32.300 and 13.32.320 of this chapter, a minimum of four (4) grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and
volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do
not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
director of public works may authorize a lower minimum. For all other reports,
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards will be required. (Ord.
1975, 2011)
13.32.410: DETERMINATION OF NONCOMPLIANCE:
The city manager may use a grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with
pretreatment standards. (Ord. 1691 § 42, 1992)
13.32.420: TIMING:
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked.
For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the U.S. postal service, the date of receipt of the report shall
govern. (Ord. 1691 § 43, 1992)
13.32.430: RECORDKEEPING:
Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying,
all records and information required to be retained under this chapter. These
records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning compliance with this chapter, or where the industrial user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city manager. (Ord.
1691 § 44, 1992)
13.32.440: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to
ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any permit or order issued
hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Industrial users shall allow the city manager or his
representatives ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
   A.   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
state, and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
   B.   The city, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated (periodically) to ensure their accuracy.
   D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
industrial user.
   E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the industrial
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   F.   The city will sample the effluent from each significant industrial user
at least once a year in order to identify, independent of information supplied
by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment
standards. Additional samples will be collected and analyzed when circumstances
warrant such action. (Ord. 1691 § 45, 1992)
13.32.450: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the city manager has been refused access to a building, structure or
property or any part thereof, and if the city manager has demonstrated probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter or that there is
a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed
to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community,
then, upon application by the city attorney, the municipal court judge of the
city shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the
specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if
anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property described. Such warrant
shall be served at reasonable hours by the city manager in the company of a
uniformed police officer of the city. In the event of an emergency affecting
public health and safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a
warrant. (Ord. 1691 § 46, 1992)
13.32.460: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a industrial user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the industrial user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user
furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction. (Ord. 1691 § 47, 1992)
13.32.470: PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in
the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the industrial users
which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. (Ord.
1691 § 48, 1992)
13.32.480: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
Whenever the city manager finds that any user has violated or is violating this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the city manager or his agent may serve upon said
user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. Further,
in the event a violation is found, the city manager, if he deems corrective
action necessary, may issue a administrative order to the user prescribing the
corrective action to be taken by user to eliminate the violation, and in said
administrative order the city manager may establish a compliance schedule for
the action or actions to be taken by user. (Ord. 1691 § 49, 1992)
13.32.490: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The city manager may order any user which causes or contributes to violation(s)
of this code, wastewater discharge permits, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city manager
and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action
may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
The hearing may be conducted by the city manager or the city manager may
designate an officer or employee to:
   A.   Issue in the name of the city notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in such hearings;
   B.   Take the evidence;
   C.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts
and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city manager for
action thereon.
At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken must be under
oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made
available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment
of the usual charges thereof.
After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances and are properly
operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be
issued. (Ord. 1691 § 50, 1992)
13.32.500: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the city manager finds that a user is violating this chapter, the user's
wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it
to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements.
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. (Ord. 1691 § 51, 1992)
13.32.510: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal
notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and
opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings set forth in section
13.32.520 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the city manager, prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under sections
13.32.490 and 13.32.520 of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this
section. (Ord. 1691 § 52, 1992)
13.32.520: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to those provisions in section
13.32.280 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions of
this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is
subject to discharge termination.
   A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
   C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling.
   E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections
13.32.050 through 13.32.100 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
13.32.490 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. (Ord.
1691 § 53, 1992)
13.32.530: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, wastewater discharge
permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the
city manager may petition the Okmulgee County district court through the city's
attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the industrial user. Such other action as appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the city. A petition
for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other
action against a user. (Ord. 1691 § 54, 1992)
13.32.540: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
Any user who violate any provision of this chapter, shall, upon conviction be
fined an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and costs.
Each day's continuation of any offense shall be deem a separate offense and
shall be punishable as such. (Ord. 1691 § 55, 1992)
13.32.550: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES:
   A.   Upset:
      1.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection A3 of this section are met.
      3.   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         a.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         b.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         c.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW and treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming
aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within 5 days):
            (1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
            (2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
            (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      5.   Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination of any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
      6.   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   B.   General/Specific Prohibitions: An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section
13.32.050 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason
to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 1) a local
limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference, or 2) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   C.   Bypass:
      1.   a. "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
         b.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      2.   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of subsections C3 and C4 of this section.
      3.   a. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the
date of the bypass if possible.
         b.   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within twenty
four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive
the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received
within twenty four (24) hours.
      4.   a. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for a bypass, unless;
            (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            (3)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
subsection C3 of this section.
         b.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection C4a of this section. (Ord. 1691 § 56, 1992)

13.36.020: CITY COUNCIL FINDINGS:
The city council of the city of Okmulgee hereby expressly finds that excessive
inflow and infiltration of stormwater from any sources, private or public, into
the city's sanitary sewer system is a nuisance and a hazard to the health,
safety and welfare of the city of Okmulgee and of its citizens and inhabitants
because such infiltration and inflow may, and at times does, overload the
capacity of the city's sanitary sewer system and the city's wastewater
treatment facility and may cause the city and/or the Okmulgee public works
authority to violate federal and state standards for wastewater treatment.
(Ord. 1782 § 1, 2001)

discharges (other than those expressly authorized by the city in writing),
drains from springs or swampy areas, or other sources of surface, storm or
ground water to a structure sewer or structure drain which is connected, either
directly or indirectly, to the sanitary sewer system, even though such
connection may have been allowable when made under then existing ordinances,
rules, practices, regulations, or standards. Provided, however, that interior
or exterior perimeter building foundation drains connected directly into the
sanitary sewer system will be exempt from the provisions of this chapter if the
connect point is not accessible and the connect was made prior to the effective

It is the purpose of this chapter to improve and promote the public health,
safety and welfare by providing for, acquiring, constructing, operating,
equipping, and maintaining within the city, the stormwater management program
and to provide a source of funding for the stormwater collection system. It is
the further intent of this chapter to:
   A.   Provide clean and sanitary channels for runoff, through regulating the
stormwater handling system;
   B.   Minimize the expenditure of public and private money for costly flood
control projects and to consolidate those that are constructed, including the
regulation of the connection of private drainage systems to the public drainage
system;
   C.   Provide a drainage system and open areas for new developments which are
capable of passing the regulatory flood without flooding structures designed
for residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses. (Ord. 1968, 2011)
13.40.015: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:
This chapter shall apply to all areas within the jurisdiction of the city. It

limit nor repeal any other powers granted under statute. (Ord. 1968, 2011)
13.40.030: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On occasions greater floods can and will occur, and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the regulatory floodplain areas or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city of Okmulgee, Oklahoma, or
any of its trusts or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. Private developers, builders and contractors remain responsible
for any errors or omissions as to work performed in an attempt to comply with
this chapter, and the city is not liable because one or more inspections or
reviews did not detect the problems of the private entities, even if the city
undertakes portions of the maintenance of the problem facilities. (Ord. 1968,
2011)
13.40.040: DEFINITION OF EQUIVALENT SERVICE UNIT:

13.40.050: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The Oklahoma legislature has, in 11 Oklahoma Statutes sections 14-111C, 22-104
(2), and 82 Oklahoma Statutes section 1601 et seq., delegated the
responsibility to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses to local
governmental units. Therefore, the city council does ordain the provisions of
this chapter. (Ord. 1968, 2011)
13.40.060: STORMWATER COLLECTION SYSTEM:
   A.   The stormwater collection system shall be designed either:
      1.   To pass a minimum of the runoff from a ten percent (10%) chance
storm in a pipe network together with an overland flow path with capacities so
that the combination of the two will pass the runoff from a one percent (1%)
chance storm under ultimate urbanized conditions, or
      2.   To pass the entire runoff from a one percent (1%) chance storm in
the pipe network. Should the entire runoff from a one percent (1%) chance storm
be conveyed in an enclosed drainage network, grading shall be designed to
convey the runoff from the one percent (1%) chance storm overland in the event
of inlet or storm sewer blockage or bypass.
      3.   In either case, an overland drainage easement shall be required for
overland flows. No overland flows shall be allowed to adversely affect
structures.
      4.   In areas where overland flows may cause problems, the city manager
may require that the entire runoff from the one percent (1%) chance storm shall
be conveyed through an enclosed drainage network.
      5.   In areas where ultimate urbanized flows are not planned for
conveyance to a regional detention facility, the city manager may reduce the
capacity requirement to the existing condition flows.
   B.   The overland flow portion of the collection system shall be confined to
dedicated rights of way, or drainage easements to assure the stormwater can
pass through the development without inundating the lowest level of any
building, dwelling, or structure. All drainage easements shall be shown on the
plat.
   C.   The detention or retention facilities which have been dedicated to and
accepted by the city of Okmulgee, and which receive stormwaters from or
discharge stormwaters to the collection system described in subsection A of
this section. (Ord. 1968, 2011)
13.40.070: SERVICE FEE AND EXEMPTIONS:
There is hereby established a service charge for the use of the city's
stormwater drainage system at rates hereinafter established; provided, however,
that the stormwater drainage system service charge shall not be imposed on the
following types of property:
   A.   Government owned highways, streets, rights of way, parks, buildings,
and open space;
   B.   Privately owned residential streets and rights of way, other than
driveways;
   C.   Oklahoma highway commission highways and Oklahoma transportation
authority rights of way;
   D.   Railroad rights of way;
   E.   Undeveloped parcels of agricultural use consisting of five (5) or more
acres and containing no habitable structures. (Ord. 1968, 2011)
13.40.080: RATE STRUCTURE:
The monthly stormwater drainage system service charge for all tracts with
impervious area is determined as follows:
   A.   Single-family, residentially used property within the corporate limits
of the city is hereby assigned one equivalent service unit for each developed
lot, tract, or parcel of record with the county clerk. For purposes of this
section, agricultural property that includes only a single habitable structure,
or multiple residential lots that include only a single habitable structure,
shall be considered residential property and only one equivalent service unit.
Agricultural property or residentially zoned property that includes more than
one habitable structure shall be assigned one equivalent service unit for each
habitable structure. Provided further, in case of duplex through quadplex
developments with two (2) or more dwelling units on a single lot, tract or
parcel, one equivalent service unit shall be applied to each dwelling unit.
   B.   The impervious surface of all other lots, tracts, or parcels of
developed real estate within the corporate limits of the city shall be measured
to determine the equivalent service units to be assigned to such lots, tracts
or parcels. The developer shall calculate and report the proposed impervious
area to the city manager for each new development. The current stormwater
drainage system service charge will be applied to each equivalent service unit
or portion thereof.
   C.   The rates established herein shall become effective on January 1, 2008,
for all areas within the city on that date. For areas annexed thereafter, the
rates shall become operative within thirty (30) days following annexation by
the City Council.
      1.   The Stormwater drainage system service charge as described in "A" of
this Section shall be three dollars ($3.00) per ESU per month.
   D.   Any property that is directly served by an approved private detention
or retention facility may apply for an adjustment in the stormwater drainage
system service charge. The city manager may adjust the stormwater drainage
system service charge for such properties using the following criteria:
      1.   The credit on the monthly stormwater drainage system service charge
on ESUs in excess of the first shall not exceed a maximum of five percent (5%)
for capital contributions of detention facilities, including fees in lieu of
detention;
      2.   The credit on the monthly stormwater drainage system service charge
on ESUs in excess of the first shall not exceed a maximum of five percent (5%)
for maintenance contributions of detention facilities. The property owner
performing the maintenance is eligible for the maintenance credit, but only for
so long as the maintenance actually and effectively continues. The maintenance
credit applies, provided that:
         a.   The owner remains responsible for all costs of structural and
nonstructural maintenance of the facility;
         b.   The facility was constructed and continues to be maintained in
compliance with the city drainage standards and specifications;
         c.   The owner obtained the proper permits from the city prior to
construction;
         d.   The maintenance credit cannot reduce the stormwater drainage
system service charge below one ESU per lot or parcel;
         e.   The city manager has the right to inspect the detention facility
at any reasonable time to determine if it is in compliance with the approved
design and continues to function properly (i.e., if the facility's performance
fails to meet proper operating standards, or the facility has been altered or
is otherwise in disrepair, the property owner shall pay the monthly stormwater
drainage system service charge at the normal rate until such time as the
facility is restored to total compliance);
         f.   Any property served by a regional detention facility that is
maintained by the city, shall be charged at the normal rate as this relates to
the maintenance credits.
   E.   The city manager may adjust and credit the stormwater drainage system
service charge for any nonresidential properties that directly contributed to
the construction and/or maintenance of a privately owned and maintained
regional detention facility, at a rate as outlined below. The regional
detention facility must be designed to detain ultimate urbanized stormwater
flows for a portion of the entire geographic watershed contributing to the
facility. The amount of the credit shall be based upon the area of off site
undeveloped property which is served by the facility. The following credit
schedule shall apply to each ESU in excess of the first:
 
Serving up to 5 acres         10 percent
Serving from 5 to 10 acres    15 percent
Serving from 10 to 50 acres   20 percent
Serving in excess of 50 acres 25 percent
 
   F.   The combination of one or more multiple credits outlined above shall
not reduce the total ESU for any property, tract or lot below one ESU. (Ord.
1968, 2011; amd. Ord. 2140, 2021)
13.40.090: ADJUSTMENT OF THE SERVICE CHARGE:
If any person considers the stormwater drainage system service charges to be
inaccurate or erroneous, the owner of the parcel may request a review of the
charges by the city manager within thirty (30) days of the bill or statement in
question. The city manager shall respond to the request within fifteen (15)
days. All requests must be in written form, and no notice of review shall delay
payment by the due date. Any adjustments found needed by the city manager shall
be accounted for on the next billing cycle. (Ord. 1968, 2011)
13.40.100: COLLECTION:
   A.   The service charges herein established for use of the city's stormwater
drainage system shall be billed to each user monthly, along with any bill for
water, sanitary sewer, solid waste collection, or other utility services
provided by the city, and such penalties as are now or may hereafter be
established for the city's utility service bills. In the event that any person,
firm or corporation shall tender as payment of water service, sanitary sewer
service, solid waste service, and/or stormwater drainage system service charge
an amount insufficient to pay in full all of the charges so billed, credit
shall be given first to the service charge for the use of the city's stormwater
drainage system, second to the charges for collection of sanitary sewer
service, third to the charge for solid waste and last to the charges for water
service.
   B.   In the event that any utility account shall become delinquent, water
services or any other city utility service may be terminated until all
delinquent charges for the use of the city's stormwater drainage system, solid
waste service, sanitary sewer service and water service shall have been paid in
full. The provisions for collection provided herein shall be cumulative to any
rights or remedies, which the city may have under the laws of the state of
Oklahoma.
   C.   In the case of users of real estate who are not billed for water,
sanitary sewer or collection of solid waste by the city, the owner of the real
estate or agent of the owner shall be billed monthly for the stormwater
drainage system service charges herein established.
   D.   All of the proceeds of this stormwater drainage system service charge
are deemed to be in payment for use of, and in receipt of benefits from, the
city stormwater management program by the real property concerning which the
charge is imposed to the owners. (Ord. 1968, 2011)
13.40.110: STORMWATER DEVELOPMENT/EARTH DISTURBANCE PERMIT:
A stormwater development/earth disturbance permit shall be obtained prior to
any development on projects which require platting, earth disturbance approval,
or alterations to or extensions of the existing public stormwater drainage
systems located within the City. A permit fee of $25.00 shall be charged by the
city for the services and permit issued under this chapter. The City Council,
or in the absence of Council resolution, the City manager, shall establish
application standards which constitute the charge or services by the City for
the permit issued under this chapter. For the sake of clarity, this stormwater
development/earth disturbance permit is separate and distinct from the
floodplain development permit described in the following chapter. (Ord. 1989,
2012; amd. Ord. 2140, 2021)

13.42.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
   A.   The legislature of the state of Oklahoma has in 11 Oklahoma Statutes
sections 41-47, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental
units to adopt ordinances designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the
city of Okmulgee, Oklahoma, ordains the following, to become effective
immediately.
   B.   The Oklahoma legislature has, in 11 Oklahoma Statutes sections 14-111C,
22-104(2), and 82 Oklahoma Statutes section 1601 et seq., delegated the
responsibility to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses to local
governmental units. Therefore, the city council does ordain the provisions of
chapter 13.40 of this title recreating a stormwater utility, this chapter
regulating construction and earth excavation as it affects flooding and runoff,
and
chapter 13.44 of this title regulating potential pollution and actual
contaminants of the floodway and drainage system. (Ord. 1969, 2011: Ord. 1966,
2010)
13.42.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city of Okmulgee are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage.
   C.   The Okmulgee city council makes the following additional findings of
fact:
      1.   Because of its physical terrain and geographical location, the city
is particularly subject to damage from stormwaters, which, from time to time,
overflow from existing watercourses and drainage facilities;
      2.   Previous regulations addressing drainage requirements for land
development must be replaced by a comprehensive approach, with local
enforcement, in order to prevent or minimize damage to property and to reduce
the potential for loss of life;
      3.   A comprehensive approach to managing stormwater runoff and
floodplain management is required to address existing and future needs; and
      4.   While the city does not own all drainage facilities within its
jurisdiction, it does own or control a sufficiently comprehensive system in
each of the major drainage basins so as to make a unified approach to flood
issues a desirable and administratively achievable goal. (Ord. 1969, 2011: Ord.
1966, 2010)
13.42.030: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   B.   Additional Purpose And Scope: It is the additional purpose of this
chapter to improve the promotion of public health, safety and welfare by
providing for, acquiring, constructing, operating, equipping, and maintaining
within the city, the stormwater management program and to provide a source of
funding for the stormwater collection system. It is the further intent of this
chapter to protect the general health, safety and welfare from the hazards and
damages of flooding from the various drainage areas in the city and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by
provisions designed to:
      1.   Provide clean and sanitary channels for runoff, through regulating
the design, construction and maintenance of the stormwater handling system;
      2.   Prevent the encroachment of building or improvements on natural
drainage channels;
      3.   Equitably apportion the cost of improvements;
      4.   Protect natural scenic areas; and to provide for the conservation of
the natural resources of the area;

FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 4, 1972.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of

been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within city of Okmulgee subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of
the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane
tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood
modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
standards.

cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height. A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established
in section
13.42.070 of this chapter. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use that cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair

associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of title 44 CFR.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term

referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by the city of Okmulgee city council and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city of Okmulgee city
council.

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (Public Law 97-348),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the city of Okmulgee city council to a person
from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full
requirements see section 60.6 of title 44 CFR.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical
datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

13.42.060: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:
   A.   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city of Okmulgee, Oklahoma.
   B.   This chapter shall also apply to all areas within the jurisdiction of
the city, even if not within a known and mapped area of special flood hazard.
(Ord. 1969, 2011: Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.070: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by FEMA in a scientific and
engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study For Okmulgee County,
Oklahoma And Incorporated Areas", dated January 6, 2011, with the accompanying
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) are hereby adopted on January 6, 2011, by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. However, until this date
the current effective flood maps for the city of Okmulgee, dated December 3,
1991, shall be used for this purpose until January 6, 2011. (Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.080: ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.090: COMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 1966, 2010)

   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.120: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city of Okmulgee or any official
or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 1966,
2010)
13.42.130: DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
The city council of the city of Okmulgee designates the city manager or his/her
designee as floodplain administrator to administer and implement the provisions
of this chapter and other appropriate sections of national flood insurance
program regulations in title 44 CFR pertaining to floodplain management.

as well as other data as required in order to administer the provisions of
sections
13.42.170 through 13.42.200 of this chapter.
   I.   When a floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator
must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within zone AE as delineated on
the Okmulgee County FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the city of Okmulgee.
   J.   After a disaster or other type of damage occurrence to structures in
the city of Okmulgee, determine if the residential and nonresidential

proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
      1.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; and
      2.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   B.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      6.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public

that area.
   C.   The floodplain administrator or city council, as applicable, may
approve certain development in zones A or AE delineated on the Okmulgee County
FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than
one foot (1'), provided that the applicant for the development permit in that
case first complies with 44 CFR section 65.12. (Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.160: VARIANCES:
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   The city council may grant variances for uses which do not satisfy
the requirements of the Oklahoma floodplain management act or this chapter, if
the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that: a) compliance with
this chapter will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property
without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people and b) satisfies the
pertinent provisions of this section. However, no variance shall be granted
where the effect of the variance will be to permit the continuance of a
condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
      2.   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma floodplain
management act or by other laws of the state.
      3.   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
twenty (20) years.
      4.   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the city
council, accompanied by a filing fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00).
      5.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection
13.42.150B of this chapter and provisions of this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      6.   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the chairman of the city
council which states that: a) the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built
lower than the base flood elevation, and b) such construction below the base
flood level increases risks to life and property.
      7.   At such time as the city council deems the petition ready for
notification to the public, the city council shall schedule a hearing and
direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in Okmulgee County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing.
      8.   The city council shall conduct the hearing and make determinations
in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section. This appeals
group shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities involved and the
advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the public at large when
determining whether the variance shall be granted.
      9.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and
         d.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      10.   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the
intent of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the
granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives stated in section
13.42.030 of this chapter.
      11.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance issued by the city council shall be sent by the floodplain
administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of
the variance.
   B.   Special Provisions:
      1.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      4.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
         a.   The criteria of subsections A5, A9, B2, and B3 of this section
are met, and
         b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.
   C.   Additional Standards For A Requested Variance:
      1.   The request for a variance shall be heard in a public hearing within
forty five (45) days after the written request is received and any additional
information requested is also received. The variance request shall contain a
detailed explanation of all conditions of the request, and the city manager,
may require the submission of such additional information, as deemed necessary.
      2.   At the hearing, the city of Okmulgee shall consider all technical
evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of
this chapter and also evaluate:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the individual owner;
         c.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         d.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         e.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         f.   The relationship of the proposed use to the city's comprehensive
plan, master drainage plan, and floodplain management program of that area; and
         g.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      3.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      4.   The city manager shall maintain the records of all variance requests
including technical information, forms, reports, etc., for a period of not less
than ten (10) years and report any variances to the federal emergency
management agency upon request.
      5.   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal
such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
      6.   The city manager shall retain and make available for inspection for
a period of not less than ten (10) years, copies of the following:
         a.   Floodplain development permits and certificates of compliance.
         b.   Variances issued.
         c.   Elevation certificates. (Ord. 1969, 2011: Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.170: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION; GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for
all new construction and substantial improvements:

flood damage. (Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.200: FLOODWAYS:
The following provisions shall apply to floodways:
   A.   Encroachments, including, but not limited to, fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development are prohibited within the
adopted floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the city of Okmulgee during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of sections
13.42.170 through 13.42.200 of this chapter.
   C.   The city of Okmulgee may permit encroachments within the adopted
floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided
that the applicant for the development permit complies with all of 44 CFR
section 65.12. (Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.210: FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT FEE SCHEDULE:
The city of Okmulgee city council establishes the following fee schedule not to
exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for any one service:

(Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.220: PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate or other certifications required in this chapter is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of
its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall
upon conviction thereof be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved
in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city council of the
city of Okmulgee or its city attorney from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
Provided, that each lot upon which such a violation occurs shall constitute a
separate offense; and each day on which violation occurs or continues shall
constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 1969, 2011: Ord. 1966, 2010)
13.42.230: APPLICATION:
   A.   If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. It is the intent that
these provisions be liberally construed in favor of the city; and deemed
neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under statute.
   B.   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
and another ordinance conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter
are hereby repealed to the extent of their inconsistency only.
   C.   In the interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be considered as minimum requirements as determined by the city and
deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.240: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On occasions greater floods can and will occur, and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the regulatory floodplain areas or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city of Okmulgee, Oklahoma, or
any of its trusts or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. Private developers, builders and contractors remain responsible
for any errors or omissions as to work performed in an attempt to comply with
this chapter, and the city is not liable because one or more inspections or
reviews did not detect the problems of the private entities, even if the city
undertakes portions of the maintenance of the problem facilities. (Ord. 1969,
2011)
13.42.245: EFFECT ON OTHER LAW:
The requirements of this chapter shall not supersede any applicable local,
state, or federal environmental requirements, including those involving
wetlands, riparian habitat, water quality, or endangered species. (Ord. 1969,
2011)
13.42.265: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
   A.   Restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
   B.   Requires that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   D.   Controls filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   E.   Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
   F.   Regulates the connection to and use of the stormwater drainage system;
and
   G.   Provides a means for maintenance of the stormwater drainage system.
(Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.270: USE OF OTHER FLOOD DATA:
When regulatory flood elevation data are not available, the city manager may
use flood information from any other authoritative source, such as historical
data or studies from other private or governmental sources, to establish flood
elevations within the regulatory flood area, for the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.280: FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
The applicant shall provide at least the following information. In areas of
historic problems or where atypical conditions exist, additional information
may be required on the permit application form.
   A.   All floodplain development permit applications shall include, but not
be limited to, plans in triplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions and elevations of the area in question; and the nature, location,
dimensions and elevations of existing or proposed development, structures,
fill, storage of materials, and drainage facilities. The city manager may
require hydrologic and hydraulic studies as required, and if so required, shall
be made under engineering seal. The applicant is responsible for any other
permits required to fulfill local, state, and federal regulatory requirements.
   B.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest point on the top
of a pad, and the lowest point on the top of the floor surface of the lowest
floor or basement, whichever is applicable, of all proposed structures. Upon
completion of the structure, the permit holder shall submit to the city manager
the as built elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or
registered land surveyor.
   C.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential
structure shall be floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of
the structure, the permit holder shall submit to the city manager the as built
floodproofed elevation certified by a licensed professional engineer or
surveyor.
   D.   A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
the nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing criteria.

volumes of water to the extent that significant erosion of floodplain soils
would occur either on the subject property, or on some other property upstream
or downstream; or 2) fail to provide compensatory storage for any measurable
loss of flood storage capacity within the applicable system as compared to
natural conditions. Computations by a licensed professional engineer must be
submitted that verify compliance with these requirements.
   H.   A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a licensed
professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate that the altered or
relocated segment will provide equal or greater conveyance than the original
channel segment, and address floodplain storage as required by the city
manager. The applicant must submit any maps, computations, or any other
materials required by the federal emergency management agency (FEMA) to revise
the documents enumerated, when notified by the city manager, and must pay any
fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated
channel segment will be maintained.
   I.   In FEMA zone A, when neither base flood elevation nor regulatory flood
elevation data are available, the applicant shall provide regulatory flood
elevation and floodplain delineation calculated by a registered professional
engineer for the proposed development.
   J.   A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, which shows
whether proposed development to be located in the regulatory flood area may
result in physical damage.
   K.   The city manager shall have the right to waive sections of the permit
requirements, subject to the developer providing adequate proof to the city
manager, that the development does not cause adverse impacts to the community.
   L.   All plans submitted by any person proposing development shall be signed
and sealed by a registered professional engineer, registered in the state of
Oklahoma. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.290: GENERAL STANDARDS:
   A.   No new habitable structures shall be constructed or placed within the
regulatory floodplain.
   B.   No habitable structures within the regulatory floodplain will be
substantially improved. (Ord. 1969, 2011)

   A.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for platted subdivision
proposals and other proposed development, including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions.
   B.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
   C.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, cable, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
   D.   Regulatory flood elevation data shall be provided with the subdivision
proposal if not otherwise provided pursuant to other provisions of this
chapter.
   E.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   F.   Adequate overflow and access routes to floodplains will be provided in
subdivision layouts. Paving of overflow and access routes may be required by

   G.   The final plat of any development requiring a FEMA LOMR will not be
accepted until such LOMR is approved in writing by FEMA. Building permits will
not be issued on any lots in developments awaiting LOMR approval.
   H.   All subdivisions will meet the stormwater and detention requirements of
the city.
   I.   All regulatory flood areas shall be designated on the final plat. (Ord.
1969, 2011)
13.42.310: MANUFACTURED HOMES:
In all regulatory flood areas no manufactured homes shall be placed in the
regulatory flood area. All existing manufactured homes shall be anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, per the city building code.
(Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.320: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Located within the areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as
shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base
flood depths of one to three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not
exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow;
therefore, the following provisions apply:
   A.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the city's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
   B.   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
      1.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the city's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
      2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy.
   C.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section have been met.
   D.   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.
1969, 2011)
13.42.330: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
13.42.320 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
   A.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR 65.12 of the national flood insurance
regulations, the city may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory
floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided
the city first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through
FEMA. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.335: RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   It is intended by this chapter that the improvements of primary
drainage and major river channels shall be the long range responsibility of the
developer and the community as a whole, since the developer and the whole
community are benefited materially. The developer of land or improvements
within an area containing a primary drainage channel shall design, plan and
carry out his developments in a manner that will not interfere with or restrict
the natural flow of water or materially change the condition of runoff within
the calculated area below the regulatory flood elevation. Increased runoff and
changes in primary channels which are created by such developments within
primary drainage areas shall be the planning responsibility of the developer
and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The
improvement of secondary drainage channels shall be the responsibility of the
developer, since the primary benefit is to the area served by the secondary
channel and not to the community as a whole.
   B.   Where construction of a storm drainage facility is required along a
property line common to two (2) or more owners, the owner hereafter proposing
development or use of his property shall be responsible for meeting the
required improvements at the time of development, including the dedication of
the necessary easements, to accommodate the improvements. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.340: UTILITIES:
In all regulatory flood areas, the following provisions are required:
   A.   Machinery and equipment servicing a building must either be elevated to
or above the regulatory flood elevation, or designed to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during a flood. This includes
heating, ventilating, and air conditioning equipment, hot water heaters,
appliances, elevator lift machinery, and electrical junction and circuit
breaker boxes. When located below the regulatory flood elevation, a licensed
professional engineer's or architect's certification of the design is required;
   B.   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
   C.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and
discharges from the system into floodwaters. Sanitary sewer and storm drainage
systems for buildings that have openings below the regulatory flood elevation
shall be provided with automatic backflow valves or other automatic backflow
devices that are installed in each discharge line passing through a building's
exterior wall;
   D.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding;
   E.   Any utilities and/or equipment within the floodplain must be anchored
down. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.345: FEMA ELEVATION CERTIFICATE:
When any portion of a lot or parcel of land contains an area of special flood
hazard, the owner of the property and/or the general contractor shall provide
to the city inspector a completed federal emergency management agency elevation
certificate on all buildings constructed at the time of the finished floor
inspection. Delivery of the certificate to the city manager shall be a warranty
by the property owner and by the general contractor that the information
contained within the certificate is accurate. City employees may use the
information contained within the certificate unless they have affirmative
knowledge that this information is inaccurate. The certificate shall be a
public document. Any building which is remodeled to a point in excess of twenty
five percent (25%) of the fair market value shall be considered new
construction for purposes of compliance in the supplying of FEMA elevation
certificates. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.350: METHODS FOR CALCULATING STREAM FLOW AND RUNOFF:
The maximum condition of rainfall for a 50-year frequency shall be used for the
purpose of determining all runoff for the sizing of drainage channels and
structures, unless otherwise specified herein. The following formula and values
shall be used for calculating all stream flow and runoff for the policies and
regulations established herein unless otherwise specified herein:
   A.   Runoff from drainage areas of five hundred (500) acres or less shall be
determined by the rational formula:
 
Q = AIR
Where:
Q = Flow in cubic feet per second.
A = Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for areas less
    than 100 acres, and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger areas.
    Percent of imperviousness of the area; may vary between 70 percent and 95
I = percent. Coefficients lower than these indicated values may be used;
    however, in such instances, individual block calculations will be submitted
    with plans.
R = Rate of rainfall over entire drainage area in inches per hour, based on
    time of concentration and latest government records for the area.
 
   B.   Runoff from drainage areas greater than five hundred (500) acres will
be determined by use of accepted engineering principles as approved by the
director.
   C.   The size of closed storm sewers, open channels, culverts, and bridges
shall be determined by using the Manning formula which may be modified for use
with runoff determined by the rational formula to:
 
Q = 1.486 r 2/3 s 1/2 A  
    n                    
Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second.
A = Cross sectional area of water in conduit in square feet.
r = Hydraulic radius of water in conduit.
s = Mean slope of hydraulic gradient in feet of vertical rise per foot of
    horizontal distance.
n = Roughness coefficient.
 
Other design methods may be required to maintain hydraulic grade line below the
ground and/or gutter elevation to eliminate flooding of the inlets or manholes.
(Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.355: PRIMARY DRAINAGE CHANNEL REQUIREMENTS:
All primary drainage channels which are located within, or immediately adjacent
to, an improvement, construction area, development or subdivision shall be
protected and improved by the developer as follows:
   A.   All land having an elevation below the 50-year maximum flood elevation
for the final improved channel shall be dedicated for the purpose of providing
drainage, for public park, or drainage and utility easement use.
   B.   The existing channel lying within or immediately adjacent to the
subdivision or parcel of land proposed for development or redevelopment shall
be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the channel shall be
straightened, widened, and improved to the extent required to prevent overflow,
resulting from a 50-year frequency rainfall, beyond the limits of the dedicated
drainage easement provided for in subsection A of this section.
   C.   Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building pads to
an elevation where all building pads will not be subject to overflow from a
regulatory flood and in a manner that will provide for a rapid runoff of
stormwater. Manufactured home placement pads shall be elevated to the level of
the regulatory flood. All manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance
with requirements outlined in the federal emergency management agency
floodplain management regulations, subpart A, section 60.3(b)(8). Substantial
improvements to existing structures within the 100-year floodplain will be
subject to all regulations and requirements of this chapter:
      1.   New construction or substantial improvements of residential
structures (including manufactured homes) and accessory buildings shall have
the lowest floor (including basements) elevated to one foot (1') above the
level of the 100-year frequency flood.
      2.   New construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures and accessory buildings within the 100-year floodplain must have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot (1') above the 100-year
flood level or floodproofed, including utility and sanitary facilities, up to
one foot (1') above the level of the regulatory flood.
      3.   Mechanical and utility equipment for residential or nonresidential
structures shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
      4.   If a nonresidential structure is intended to be floodproofed, a
registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review
structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall
certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with the
accepted standards of practice for meeting the elevation requirements of this
chapter. A record of such certificates which includes the specific elevation
(in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall
be submitted to and maintained by the office of community development.
   D.   Whenever channel improvements are carried out, sodding, backsloping,
cribbing, and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to
control erosion for the anticipated conditions and flow resulting from a 50-
year frequency rainfall.
   E.   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it
is placed in an enclosed storm sewer except under the following conditions:
      1.   Where a paved street surface at least two (2) lanes wide is provided
on both sides of a paved channel so as to provide access to abutting
properties.
      2.   Where lots are platted to back up to the street right of way where
the drainage channel is located between the rear lot line and the paved street,
provided, that there is no access to the rear of the lot from the street, and
further provided that at no time in the future shall access be allowed or
constructed over the open drainage channel to the rear of a lot so platted. For
the purpose of these regulations, a lot which sides to a public street is not
considered to back up to the street right of way.
      3.   When a condition outlined in either subsection E1 or E2 of this
section is present, adequate space adjacent to the channel shall be dedicated
as right of way to provide for maintenance of the paved drainage channel and
its unpaved bank.
   F.   Culverts, bridges, and other drainage structures shall be constructed
in accordance with the specifications and design criteria of the city whenever
the city may have present or future maintenance responsibility. (Ord. 1969,
2011)
13.42.360: SECONDARY DRAINAGE CHANNELS AND SURFACE DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS:
All secondary drainage channels which are within, or immediately adjacent to,
an improvement, development or subdivision, shall be protected and improved by
the developer as follows:
   A.   All land having an elevation below the 50-year maximum flood elevation
for the final improved channel shall be dedicated for the purpose of providing
drainage, for public park, or drainage and utility easement use.
   B.   Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of collecting
surface water from adjacent properties or intercepting and diverting side hill
drainage shall be improved open channels.
   C.   Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of
transporting water through the block or collecting water from cross channels
and which have a drainage area of less than forty (40) acres shall be improved
with closed storm sewers unless special approval has been given by the director
for construction of a concrete lined channel; and where the secondary drainage
channel has a drainage area of greater than forty (40) acres, an improved open
channel or closed storm sewer shall be provided. When the unit to be drained is
less than six (6) acres, the director may modify the requirements of the first
part of this provision to permit a paved open channel, designed for use as a
sidewalk, having a minimum width of four feet (4') and provided with six inch
(6") curbs, when designed to drain from the street to a natural stream or
improved open channel.
   D.   Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building pads to
an elevation where all building pads will not be subject to overflow from a
regulatory flood and in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff of
stormwater. Manufactured home placement pads shall be elevated to the
regulatory flood elevation. All manufactured homes shall be anchored in
accordance with requirements outlined in the federal emergency management
agency floodplain management regulations, subpart A, section 60.3(b)(8).
Substantial improvements to existing structures within the 100-year floodplain
will be subject to all regulations and requirements of this chapter. New
construction or substantial improvements of residential or nonresidential
structures (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor
(including basements) elevated to one foot (1') above the level of the
regulatory flood. Nonresidential structures and accessory buildings may meet
this requirement by floodproofing the structures, including utility and
sanitary facilities, up to one foot (1') above the level of the regulatory
flood. Mechanical and utility equipment for residential or nonresidential
structures shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
If a nonresidential structure is intended to be floodproofed, a registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural
design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with the accepted
standards of practice for meeting the elevation requirements of this chapter. A
record of such certificates which includes the specific elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be submitted
to and maintained by the department of community development.
   E.   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it
is placed in an enclosed storm sewer except under the following conditions:
      1.   Where a paved street surface of at least two (2) lanes is provided
on both sides of a paved channel so as to provide access to abutting
properties; or
      2.   Where lots are platted to back up to the street right of way where
the drainage channel is located between the rear of the lot line and the paved
street, and further provided that at no time in the future shall access be
allowed or constructed over the open drainage channel to the rear of a lot so
platted. For the purpose of these regulations, a lot which sides to a public
street is not considered to back up to the street right of way.
      3.   When a condition outlined in either subsection E1 or E2 of this
section is present, adequate space adjacent to the channel shall be dedicated
as right of way to provide for maintenance of the paved drainage channel and
its unpaved bank.
   F.   In single-family residential, duplex or manufactured home developments,
site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each
dwelling lot will flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel, sodded
swale, or paved street without crossing more than four (4) adjacent lots.
   G.   Surface water collected in streets shall be diverted to storm drains at
satisfactory intervals to prevent overflow of six inch (6") high curbs during
25-year frequency rain for the area and grades involved. Drainage area allowed
for surface flow on streets at point of diversion shall not exceed twenty (20)
acres, regardless of flow.
   H.   Drainage easement of satisfactory width to provide working room for
construction and maintenance shall be provided for all storm sewers with the
minimum width being fifteen feet (15').
   I.   Open channels shall be improved by providing a paved section that will
carry the runoff from a rain of 50-year frequency within the lined section and
sodded section to carry the additional runoff from a regulatory flood. Whenever
an open improved channel is required or authorized for a secondary drainage
channel under the provisions of these regulations and the channel crosses
residential lots which have been developed under the community unit plan and/or
planned unit development or where the channel improvement is to be designed as
an area that will be maintained by a property owners' association, the director
may modify the requirements of the first part of this provision to permit a
channel improvement design in keeping with landscape architectural plans,
provided all hydraulic requirements to support the overflow resulting from a
regulatory flood rainfall are met in such a manner as to prevent flooding of
all building pads. (Ord. 2017, 2014: Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.365: RURAL SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   The development of rural acreage subdivisions, one acre or larger lots,
shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each lot will
flow to a roadway side ditch, swale, channel, or natural creek. Prior to final
plat or building permit approval the developer shall provide the community
development department detailed construction plans showing channel and roadway
side ditch sizes, grades, and driveway pipe sizes as well as erosion control
measures necessary to prevent erosion of the proposed channel construction.
These improvements shall include, but not be limited to, sodding, channel
lining or ditch checks as required to prevent erosion of the proposed or
existing channel. These improvements shall be the responsibility of the
developer and shall be installed by the developer and inspected by the city
prior to the issuance of building permits.
   B.   Runoff from a 25-year frequency storm shall be used for the purpose of
determining the sizing of roadway side ditches and driveway pipes. Surface
water collected in roadway side ditches shall be directed to a secondary
drainage channel not located within the street right of way as often as the
terrain will allow.
   C.   Runoff from a 50-year frequency storm shall be used for sizing
channels, creeks, and any structures that are needed for street crossings.
   D.   Site improvements shall provide for the grading of all building pads to
an elevation that will not be subject to overflow from a regulatory flood and
in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff of stormwater. Manufactured
home placement pads shall be elevated to the level of the regulatory flood. All
manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with requirements outlined
in the federal emergency management agency floodplain management regulations,
subpart A, section 60.3(b)(8). Mechanical and utility equipment for residential
or nonresidential structures shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding. Substantial improvements to existing structures within the regulatory
floodplain will be subject to all regulations and requirements of this chapter.
The areas projected for inundation by the 50-year frequency flood shall remain
free of all structures and shall be preserved in as natural a condition as
possible. The maintenance of channels serving drainage areas of less than five
hundred (500) acres shall be the responsibility of the property owner, the
adjoining or abutting property owner or owners, or a duly constituted
homeowners' association unless such improvements are installed by the developer
as described above and accepted for maintenance by the city. Drainage areas
containing more than five hundred (500) acres shall be improved as outlined
above. (Ord. 2017, 2014: Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.370: STORMWATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM:
   A.   All stormwater runoff shall be subject to review and approval by the
city with regard to analysis, design and construction of drainage facilities.
The appropriate public authority shall have the right to maintain, or cause to
be maintained, the drainage system for its intended purposes. If a basin master
drainage plan is adopted for the area under consideration, then the provisions
of the plan shall be adhered to unless amended.
   B.   The stormwater drainage system, both public and private, may consist
of: 1) roadways, storm sewers, detention facilities, retention facilities,
improved channels; 2) unimproved drainageways left in their natural condition;
3) the areas covered by drainageway easements for the purpose of providing
overland flow; and 4) all appurtenances to the above including inlets,
manholes, junction boxes, head walls, dissipaters, culverts, etc. All portions
of the drainage system that exist on or in dedicated street rights of way or
property owned by the city in fee shall be owned and maintained by the city,
unless provided otherwise by agreement or covenant. Improved and natural
channels on private property shall be maintained by the property owners. In
this context, the removal of dead or dying trees or storm debris shall not be
considered to alter the channel so as to make it no longer a natural channel.
   C.   Every development shall be provided with a stormwater drainage system
designed by an engineer registered in the state of Oklahoma, adequate to serve
the development, and otherwise shall meet the approval requirements of the
officials having jurisdiction.
   D.   The stormwater drainage system shall be designed so that property
owners located downstream from and upstream from the development shall not be
injuriously affected by the construction, operation, or maintenance of such
system.
   E.   The stormwater drainage system plans prepared and sealed by a
professional engineer shall show both plan and profile views of the proposed
improvements. Any manhole or access point to the system that is buried out of
sight shall be dimensioned to permanent objects in the vicinity.
   F.   The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to receive and pass
the runoff from a one percent (1%) chance storm under ultimate urbanization. In
areas covered by the regulatory flood area, that data shall govern. In areas
not covered by the regulatory flood area, the design engineer shall prepare and
submit a study for the area. The ultimate urbanized flow shall be confined
within the said stormwater drainage system.
   G.   A minimum of the ten percent (10%) chance and one percent (1%) chance
storms shall be evaluated when designing the stormwater drainage systems. (Ord.
1969, 2011)
13.42.375: STORMWATER COLLECTION SYSTEM:
   A.   The stormwater collection system shall be designed either:
      1.   To pass a minimum of the runoff from a ten percent (10%) chance
storm in a pipe network together with an overland flow path with capacities so
that the combination of the two will pass the runoff from a one percent (1%)
chance storm under ultimate urbanized conditions.
      2.   Or, to pass the entire runoff from a one percent (1%) chance storm
in the pipe network. Should the entire runoff from a one percent (1%) chance
storm be conveyed in an enclosed drainage network, grading shall be designed to
convey the runoff from the one percent (1%) chance storm overland in the event
of inlet or storm sewer blockage or bypass.
      3.   In either case, an overland drainage easement shall be required for
overland flows. No overland flows shall be allowed to adversely affect
structures.
      4.   In areas where overland flows may cause problems, the city manager
may require that the entire runoff from the one percent (1%) chance storm shall
be conveyed through an enclosed drainage network.
      5.   In areas where ultimate urbanized flows are not planned for
conveyance to a regional detention facility, the city manager may reduce the
capacity requirement to the existing condition flows.
   B.   The overland flow portion of the collection system shall be confined to
dedicated rights of way, or drainage easements to assure the stormwater can
pass through the development without inundating the lowest level of any
building, dwelling, or structure. All drainage easements shall be shown on the
plat.
   C.   The distance between inlets, as well as the distance to the first inlet
on a street shall be determined by the lesser of the following:
      1.   For the one percent (1%) chance storm, water depth shall not exceed
the top of curb, or
      2.   Six hundred feet (600').
   D.   At sump locations, the water depth shall not exceed six inches (6")
above the top of curb, or twelve inches (12") above the top of grate, whichever
is less, for the one percent (1%) chance storm. Where sump collection systems
are used, an overflow route shall be provided in the event of a complete
blockage of the inlet of pipe. If the inlets and pipe are sized for the one
percent (1%) chance storm, a sod overflow can be used. If a ten percent (10%)
chance storm inlet and pipe system is designed, the overflow area shall be
concrete lined. When a sod overflow structure is constructed, it shall be lined
with Bermuda grass or approved equal and shall contain energy dissipaters, if
required at the outflow point.
   E.   Driveway approaches shall be designed and constructed so that the
runoff from the one percent (1%) chance storm shall not leave the roadway
except in locations where the driveway is designed as part of the drainage
system.
   F.   Runoff from areas greater than one-half (1/2) acre outside the roadway
of arterial and collector streets shall be collected before it reaches the
roadway. In no circumstance shall concentrated flows be allowed to discharge
into arterial streets. Parking lots shall have internal drainage systems so as
to reduce concentrated flow onto streets. This requirement shall not apply to
residential lots used as single-family residences. The city manager may approve
sheet flows to the subject streets when connecting to an underground storm
sewer system is not economical. In sheet flow instances, the developer must
prove no adverse impact to the traveling public, and that the street drainage
system is capable of conveying the increased flows.
   G.   Site grading shall provide surface water drainage directly into a storm
sewer, natural drainage course, improved channel, or paved street without
crossing more than four (4) adjacent lots.
   H.   No inlets shall be designed for placement within driveways or entries
unless individually approved by the city manager.
   I.   Drainage or utility easements of satisfactory width to provide working
room for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all stormwater
collection systems. In no case shall the total easement width be less than
fifteen feet (15').
   J.   All improved open drainage courses shall be maintained by the owner of
the land upon which they are located and by the person or entity actually
occupying the land upon which the improved open drainage courses are located.
Maintenance called for by this section shall be performed as often as necessary
to keep the drainage course free of debris and any wild growth above the height
of eighteen inches (18") above the finished grade of the improved drainage
course. Maintenance as necessary to keep sedimentation from exceeding twelve
inches (12") in depth above the finished grade will also be performed. In the
event that a person or entity charged with the maintenance of an improved open
drainage course allows sedimentation in excess of the limits prescribed above,
or allows wild growth or debris in excess of the limits prescribed above, to
accumulate within the improved open drainage course, and the premises upon
which the sedimentation, wild growth, or debris is allowed to accumulate is
hereby expressly declared to be a nuisance. In addition to any other remedies
available to the city, such nuisances may be abated in the manner provided
under this code for any other nuisance. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.380: DETENTION:
   A.   All development except for the following specific exclusions shall be
subject to the requirements of this section:
      1.   Single-family residential homes being constructed on lots final
platted prior to December 31, 2007, or on unplatted properties.
      2.   Other residential housing being constructed on lots containing two
(2) acres or less final platted or on unplatted properties where total
ownership prior to December 31, 2007, consists of two (2) acres or less. It is
the intent of this section that larger parcels may not be subdivided into
smaller parcels to qualify for exclusion.
   B.   In drainage areas with known downstream flooding of structures, or if
it is determined that development of subject property will cause or contribute
to flooding or sedimentation of existing structures downstream, the developer
shall install detention facilities maintaining a discharge rate not to exceed
the historical runoff rate prior to development.
      1.   For common drainage locations that serve an area with ten (10) or
more disturbed acres at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin
providing three thousand six hundred (3,600) cubic feet of storage per acre
drained or equivalent control measures, shall be provided where attainable
until final stabilization of the site. The three thousand six hundred (3,600)
cubic feet of storage area per acre drained does not apply to flows from off
site areas and flows from on site areas that are either undisturbed or have
undergone final stabilization where such flows are diverted around both the
disturbed area and the sediment basin. Where providing three thousand six
hundred (3,600) cubic feet of storage per acre drained is not attainable,
smaller sediment basins and/or sediment traps should be used.
      2.   After the construction activities have been completed and site has
undergone final stabilization, upon the approval of the manager structures may
be removed.
   C.   In drainage areas where the city has no record of downstream flooding
of structures and development of the subject property using a runoff
coefficient of seventy percent (70%) would not cause downstream flooding of
existing structures, detention will not be required. Detention storage will be
required for the increased runoff resulting from development having
imperviousness in excess of seventy percent (70%) for all developments.
   D.   Detention shall not be required in drainage areas where the city has no
record of downstream flooding of structures and drainage calculations provided
by the developer or the city indicate projected flooding of existing downstream
structures would not occur assuming the drainage basin were totally developed
utilizing maximum projected land use as indicated in the long range
comprehensive plan.
   E.   When it has been determined on site detention is required, engineering
plans and drainage calculations shall be provided to the community development
department for review and approval when filing a final plat or applying for a
building permit on unplatted property.
   F.   The required volume for stormwater detention shall be calculated on the
basis of the runoff from all storms from the ten percent (10%) chance storm up
to the one percent (1%) chance storm. This volume of storage shall be provided
for the fully developed watershed that is tributary to the area designated for
detention purposes. The stormwater release rate shall be considered when
calculating the stormwater storage capacity and the control structure designed
to maintain a discharge rate not to exceed the rate of existing conditions
regardless of the depth of stormwater in the storage area.
   G.   Public regional detention facilities may be designed with one percent
(1%) chance storm outflow rates equal to or lower than predevelopment values
with possible increased flow rates for the twenty percent (20%) chance, ten
percent (10%) chance, and two percent (2%) chance storms from predevelopment
flow rates under those conditions where downstream areas are not adversely
impacted.
   H.   If the development is situated in such a manner that the stormwater is
discharged into a stormwater system which the city manager determines will not
be adversely affected, the developer may make a monetary payment or some other
form of valuable consideration to the city in accordance with section
13.42.435 of this chapter, in lieu of constructing an on site detention
facility.
   I.   All applications for payment of a fee in lieu of on site detention
requirements shall be submitted to the community development department with
the following information for review:
      1.   Plot plan drawn to scale showing location, property dimensions, and
proposed construction or development including all impervious surfaces.
      2.   A summary showing total impervious surfaces in square feet.
After receipt of the above, the community development department may accept
payment of a fee in lieu of on site detention facilities or may deny the
application and require on site detention or other improvement to the
stormwater control system.
   J.   Fees to be accepted shall be tendered prior to the issuance of a
building permit. Should the impervious surfaces on a given property at the time
of application for an occupancy or use permit be less than that stated on the
building permit, then the permittee may request that the permit fees be
recalculated, the excess fees refunded to the payee and the building permit
amended. Should the impervious surfaces on a given property be greater than
stated on the building permit, additional fees shall be due pursuant to a
recalculation of the fees and must be tendered before any occupancy or use
permit may be issued.
   K.   "Impervious surface" shall mean any hard surfaced areas which prevent
or retard the entry of water into the soil in the manner and to the extent that
such water entered the soil under natural conditions, or where water is caused
to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow
than was present under natural conditions. Impervious surfaces shall include,
but are not limited to, rooftops except roof overhangs; sidewalks; paving;
driveways; parking lots; walkways; patio areas; storage areas; and asphalt,
concrete, gravel, oiled macadam or other surfaces which similarly affect the
natural infiltration or runoff patterns of real property in its natural state.
   L.   Impervious surface installed or constructed as a part or portion of a
public street or a private or public sidewalk in the public street right of way
shall not be calculated as a part of the fee collected in lieu of on site
detention.
   M.   Fees accepted shall be deposited in a separate account; fees shall be
utilized for the costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred in evaluating,
preventing, reducing, eliminating, or attempting to eliminate, prevent, or
reduce the known or projected flooding problems in the watershed of the subject
property; and shall be utilized to maintain such facilities and stormwater
control systems.
   N.   Should adequate fees have been accepted and all existing and projected
flooding problems in a given watershed been resolved, on site detention
requirements, and fees in lieu thereof, shall be utilized to maintain
stormwater control systems in that watershed.
   O.   The fees in lieu of on site detention shall be in the amounts
established hereafter.
   P.   As used in this section, the fees tendered hereunder shall be deemed
accepted when the funds required are actually received by the city treasurer.
   Q.   Whenever a property upon which an impervious surface is installed or
constructed lies within two (2) different watersheds, the fees shall be
proportionately applied based upon the amount of impervious surface within each
watershed. Whenever a property upon which an impervious surface is installed or
constructed lies within and without a watershed requiring on site detention
facilities, or fees in lieu thereof, the fees shall be accepted and applied
based upon the amount of impervious surface within the watershed so requiring.
   R.   It is unlawful for any person to erect, construct, install, enlarge,
move, make, put together, or convert any building, structure, improvement,
facility, or impervious surface within the city, or cause the same to be done,
without first paying any fee in lieu of detention required by this section.
   S.   The number of square feet of impervious surface installed or
constructed shall be established as follows:
 
a = b - c
Where:
a = The number of square feet of impervious surface for which the applicant
    must pay a fee.
    The total square feet of impervious surface at the property as set forth in
b = the new building permit or any recalculation thereof as provided in
    subsection J of this section.
    The total square feet of impervious surface on the existing building
    permit, if any, for the property on the effective date of this section or
c = such subsequent building permit appropriately issued, whichever reflects
    the greater total square feet of impervious surface already authorized on
    said property.
 
After receipt of the above, the community development department shall make a
report listing known downstream flooding locations and projected increase in
runoff from the proposed construction site.
   T.   Changes may be made to streams or channels within the regulatory flood
fringe area, subject to approval of the city manager, provided that:
      1.   The volume of floodwater storage is not reduced;
      2.   Neither downstream or upstream water surface elevations are
adversely increased; and
      3.   All required permits are obtained prior to starting work.
   U.   Stormwater detention or other storage facilities shall not be located
in street rights of way or easements unless it is placed in an enclosed storm
sewer system.
   V.   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and
shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each stormwater
storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event
that a storm in excess of the regulatory flood occurs. This emergency overflow
facility shall be designed to function without attention and shall become a
part of the "natural" or surface channel system. Hydraulic calculations shall
be submitted to substantiate all design features. Detention storage facilities
herein provided for shall not be dedicated to the public for public maintenance
unless located on a primary or secondary drainage channel. All private on site
facilities shall be properly maintained by the owner such that they do not
become a nuisance. Nuisance conditions shall include, but not be limited to,
improper storage resulting in uncontrolled runoff and overflow, stagnant water
with concomitant algae growth, insect breeding and odors, discarded debris,
safety hazards created by the facility's operation and silting of the facility
decreasing the design storage capacity by twenty percent (20%) or more. All
detention facilities located on private property shall be accessible at all
times for inspection.
   W.   Where development of a property presents the threat of increased
flooding or damage by runoff to downstream structures, the facilities for
stormwater runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earthmoving or
drainage construction on the project site.
   X.   The construction of the storm sewer water control system shall be
accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage
capacity can be increased to provide benefit to the municipality, the city may,
but is not required to, participate in the construction cost. In any event, the
city's participation is subject to the availability of funds and a written
agreement with the city.
   Y.   When it has been determined by the department that alternative methods
of protecting downstream properties can be accomplished without causing
substantial detriment to the public good, safety or welfare or without being
contrary to the spirit, purpose and intent of this chapter, the city manager
may accept a fee in lieu of requiring on site detention facilities. (Ord. 2017,
2014: Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.385: ACCEPTABLE TYPES OF STORAGE:
Acceptable types of detention or retention facilities:
   A.   Dry Detention Facilities: Such facilities must be provided with
underground drainage or a concrete trickle channel to eliminate standing water
after storm periods. This type of facility may be used for recreational
purposes and other approved uses to the maximum extent possible when not
functioning as a detention facility.
   B.   Wet Detention Facilities: Such facilities will be used on a limited
basis and will be approved only when the pond inflow is sufficient to maintain
pond water surface levels and to preclude the water from stagnating.
   C.   Underground Detention Facilities: This type of facility may consist of
basins, tanks, and/or oversized storm sewers.
   D.   Parking Lot Detention: This type of facility may be used provided the
maximum one percent (1%) chance storm ponding depth is twelve inches (12") or
less. Any repaving of the parking lot shall be evaluated for impact on volume
and release rates and are subject to approval by the city manager. All parking
lot detention areas shall have a minimum of two (2) signs posted identifying
the detention pond area. The signs shall have a minimum of one and one-half
(1.5) square feet and contain the following message:
      WARNING
      This area is a stormwater detention facility and is subject to periodic
flooding to a depth of (provide one percent chance storm design depth).
      Any suitable materials and geometry of the sign is permissible, subject
to approval by the city manager.
   E.   Retention Facilities: Such facilities may be used when the existing
conditions' runoff from a watershed would exceed the capacities of downstream
facilities. The retention facility shall contain the one percent (1%) chance
stormwater runoff and release shall be by evaporation, infiltration or slow
release at outflow rates less than existing levels. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.390: RIVER CHANNEL REQUIREMENTS:
All river channels which are located within or immediately adjacent to an
improvement or subdivision shall be protected and improved by the developer as
follows:
   A.   All land having an elevation below the 50-year maximum flood elevation
for the final improved channel shall be dedicated for the purpose of providing
drainage and/or utility easement use.
   B.   The existing channel shall be cleaned to provide free flow of water,
straightened, widened, leveed or diked, or otherwise improved to the extent
required to prevent overflow from a 50-year frequency flood.
   C.   Site improvements for residential building must have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to one foot (1') above the regulatory flood
level. Manufactured home placement pads shall be elevated to the regulatory
flood. All manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with requirements
outlined in the federal emergency management agency floodplain management
regulations, subpart A, section 60.3(b)(8).
   D.   New construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures and accessory buildings within the regulatory floodplain must have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot (1') above the
regulatory flood level or floodproofed including utility and sanitary
facilities up to one foot (1') above the level of the regulatory flood.
Mechanical and utility equipment for residential or nonresidential structures
shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. If a
nonresidential structure is intended to be floodproofed, a registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural
design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with the accepted
standards of practice for meeting the elevation requirements of this chapter. A
record of such certificates, which includes the specific elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be
submitted to and maintained in the community development department.
   E.   Fill, grading measures and building floodproofing measures shall be
approved by a representative in the community development department. The
minimum standards shall apply as set forth in the "floodproofing regulations"
prepared by the office of the chief of engineers, U.S. army, Washington, D.C.,
June 1972. (Ord. 2017, 2014: Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.395: REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Cost of construction of bridges and culverts at arterial streets and
major thoroughfares may be borne by the city. The city may, but is not required
to, participate in the cost of construction of bridges and culverts at
collector streets where the required hydraulic cross section of the bridge or
culvert is greater than forty (40) square feet, provided in any event that
participation of the city is subject to the availability of funds. Cost to be
borne by the city, if any, will be determined by the total cost of bridge or
culvert divided by the square feet of cross section all multiplied by the
square feet of required hydraulic cross section less forty (40) square feet.
   B.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an owner from
bearing all costs if he so desires. Nothing in this section shall require the
city to construct any bridge or culvert. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.400: EROSION CONTROL:
Erosion control shall be provided during the construction phase on all
construction sites as necessary to prevent impacts to off-site areas and/or
public rights of way. The primary goal of erosion control and best management
practices is to minimize erosion and sedimentation during construction
activities until final grading, landscaping and storm sewer structures are in
place. Best management practices include, but are not limited to, seeding,
sodding, sprigging, silt fences, earth dikes or swales, temporary stream
crossings, storm sewer inlet protection, temporary sediment basins, and
stabilized construction entrances. Failure to provide sediment and erosion
control protection can result in suspension of the earth change, stormwater
development, and building permits. A violation of this section by the failure
to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute an offense, and any
person or entity convicted thereof shall be punishable as set forth in this
code. Providing, that each lot upon which such violation occurs shall
constitute a separate offense; and each day on which a violation occurs or is
allowed to remain shall constitute a separate offense. The imposition of
criminal sanctions shall not prevent city of Okmulgee from taking any lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy a violation. (Ord. 1969, 2011; amd.
Ord. 2142, 2021)
13.42.405: IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED BY PLANNING COMMISSION:
When the planning commission, subsequent to the submission by a developer of a
preliminary plat, requires a bridge or culvert at a residential street and the
required hydraulic cross section is greater than forty (40) square feet, the
city may, but is not required to, participate in the cost of construction of
the bridge or culvert. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.410: BRIDGE AND CULVERT REQUIREMENTS:
All flow of water across continuous streets or alleys shall be through culverts
or bridges.
   A.   Bridges: New structurally spanned bridges shall have adequate capacity
to pass the one percent (1%) chance storm ultimate urbanized flows with one
foot (1') of freeboard under the low chord. A backwater analysis shall be
provided to illustrate compliance with this requirement and to ensure there are
no adverse downstream or upstream impacts.
   B.   Culverts: Culverts constructed hereafter at new locations under public
roads shall have adequate capacity to pass the 50-year storm ultimate urbanized
flows with a maximum water surface elevation not exceeding six inches (6")
below the lowest pavement (or gutter) elevation in the roadway sump. A
backwater analysis shall be provided to illustrate compliance with this
requirement and to ensure there are no adverse downstream or upstream impacts.
   C.   Backwater Analysis Review: Upon review of the backwater analysis,
should it determine that adverse impacts may occur from the construction of new
structurally spanned bridges and/or culverts under public roads, the city,
through the city manager, may authorize the design for construction of such
bridges and/or culverts to convey less than ultimate urbanized flows in a
manner that does not violate section
13.42.440 of this chapter. (Ord. 1969, 2011)
13.42.415: STUB STREET DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS:

13.42.435: FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION:
When approved or required by the city manager, a developer shall make a
monetary payment or some other form of valuable consideration in lieu of
building a detention facility. The city manager shall make the determination of
whether fee in lieu of detention will be allowed or required based upon
capacity of the receiving stormwater drainage system and whether regional
detention facilities are either proposed or in place. The developer shall
provide the city manager calculations of the number of square feet of increased
impervious area and the city manager shall prepare a bill for payment of fee in
lieu of detention. The rate for the fee in lieu of detention shall be thirty
cents ($0.30) per impervious square foot. The fee shall be paid at the time the
final plat is released for residential developments. The fee shall be paid
prior to issuance of any building permit for nonresidential developments. When
these fees are collected, they shall be deposited into a stormwater capital
improvements fund, which will be used for future or ongoing stormwater
improvement and regional detention projects. (Ord. 1969, 2011; amd. Ord. 2140,
2021)

systems shall be operated and maintained so that property owners located
downstream from and upstream from the development shall not be injuriously
affected.
   G.   Operations responsibility of post-construction best management
practices and stormwater drainage system shall be borne by the property owner.
   H.   Maintenance responsibility of post-construction best management
practices and stormwater drainage systems shall be borne by the property owner.
   I.   In the event that the owner fails to properly operate or maintain the
post-construction best management practices and stormwater drainage systems
such that negative stormwater quality or quantity impacts to the municipal
separate storm sewer system, any watercourse of the City, or any waters of the
state or United States or stormwater drainage systems and or receiving streams
either on the subject property or on off-site properties occurs or is imminent,
the City of Okmulgee, Oklahoma may order compliance with this section by
written notice of violation (NOV) to the owner of record as listed at the
Office of the Okmulgee County Clerk. Such notice may require without
limitation:
      1.   The performance of monitoring, analysis, and reporting;
      2.   The elimination of illicit discharges or connections;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollutants and
restoration of any affected property;
      5.   The implementation of source control or treatment best management
practices;
If abatement of a violation or the restoration of affected property is
required, the notice of violation shall set forth a deadline that such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice of violation shall
further advise that should the violator fail to complete the remediation or
restoration within the established deadline, the work may be performed by the
City of Okmulgee, or its designated contractor, and the cost shall be paid by
the owner. (Ord. 2141, 2021)

   A.   Submission Of Correspondence: Any industry that performs an industrial
activity that is required under OPDES, OAC 252:606, to obtain an OPDES
stormwater discharge permit from ODEQ or to obtain an NPDES stormwater
discharge permit from the EPA, under 40 CFR part 122.26, shall submit a copy of
that application and permit, as well as any written correspondence with any
federal, state or local agency regarding the permit, to the director within
fifteen (15) days of a request.
   B.   Availability: Any permits, pollution prevention plans, or other
document regarding an industry's or construction site's OPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall be made available to the director upon request.
   C.   Spills: Any person or industry shall, at the earliest possible time
but, in any case, no later than one hour from discovery, orally report to the
director a spill, release, dumping, or other situation that has contributed or
is likely to contribute pollutants into the MS4. This notification shall
include the location, type, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
actions taken. Written notification shall also be made to the public works
department of the city within five (5) days of the discovery of the spill. This
notification shall include all the notification requirements specified within
this section. These reporting requirements shall be in addition to and not in
lieu of any other reporting requirements imposed under federal, state and local
laws or regulations.
   D.   Additional Reports: All persons or industrial facilities may be
required to provide any other report deemed necessary by the director to
monitor, maintain, and ensure compliance with this chapter.
   E.   Timing: Reports required to be submitted pursuant to this chapter, or
orders issued by the director, shall be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports that are not deposited, postage prepaid, into a
mail facility serviced by the United States postal service, or reports whose
postmark is illegible, the actual date of receipt shall govern. (Ord. 1910 § 2,
2007)
13.44.050: COMPLIANCE MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Stormwater Sampling Event Criteria: When the director requires that a
sample for monitoring of a storm event shall be obtained, the following
criteria shall be met:
      1.   The depth of the rainfall shall be greater than one-tenth inch
(0.1") or its equivalent;
      2.   The sample storm event shall be preceded by at least seventy two
(72) hours of less than one-tenth inch (0.1") of rainfall; and
      3.   All point sources from the premises or industry required to sample
must be sampled, unless otherwise specified, in accord with subsection E of
this section.
   B.   Sampling: When the director has cause to believe that any person or
industrial facility is violating the provisions of this chapter or in order to
comply with the city's MS4 permit, a person or industrial facility may be
required to obtain either a grab or composite sample and analyze any discharge,
stormwater, ground water or sediment, and provide a copy of the analysis to the
director for review.
   C.   Illicit Discharge Sampling: When the director has cause to believe that
any discharge is an illicit discharge, the director may obtain either a grab or
composite sample and analyze the discharge. If the director determines that the
discharge is an illicit discharge, then the director may fully recover all cost
of the sampling and analysis from the person or industrial facility. When the
discharge is likely to contain illicit discharges on a recurring basis, the
person or industrial facility may be required by the director to conduct
monitoring activities at its expense.
   D.   Chain Of Custody: Upon completion of sample collections and
documentation, a written record of the chain of custody shall be completed. The
chain of custody record shall be an accurate step by step documentation of the
sampling path, from origin through analysis. It shall contain the following
information:
      1.   Name of the person(s) collecting the sample;
      2.   Sample ID numbers;
      3.   Date and time of sample collection;
      4.   Location of sample collection;
      5.   Name(s) and signature(s) of all persons handling the sample in the
field and in the laboratory;
      6.   Type of sampling equipment used;
      7.   Type of preservation; and
      8.   Certification of sample authenticity.
A copy of the chain of custody shall remain with all sample analyses sent to
the city for review.
   E.   Substitution Of Substantially Identical Effluents: When a person or
industry is required to sample a storm event and that person or industry has
two (2) or more outfalls, with substantially identical effluents, based on
similarities of the industrial activities, significant materials and stormwater
management practices occurring within the outfalls' drainage areas, examination
of only one of the outfalls shall be required; provided the report shall state
the examination applies to substantially identical outfall(s). For this to be
permissible, the person or industry shall first petition the director to allow
the sampling of only one outfall and report that the data applies to
substantially identical outfall(s). This petition shall include locations of
outfalls, why the outfalls are expected to discharge substantially identical
effluents and estimates of the size of the drainage area of each outfall, in
square feet.
   F.   Monitoring Methods: Monitoring shall be conducted according to test
procedures approved under 40 CFR part 136. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain
test procedures for the pollutant in question, analyses shall be conducted in
accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. The director can select which
of several available methodologies shall be used. (Ord. 1910 § 2, 2007)
13.44.055: REQUIREMENTS FOR BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
   A.   Implementation: If the director determines that a stormwater discharge
into the MS4 is, or has the potential of, contributing to water quality
degradation, has potential to cause any violation of this chapter, or causes a
violation of the city's OPDES municipal stormwater discharge permit, a BMP
shall be implemented. The type and number of BMPs shall be addressed
individually, with the initial implementation of nonstructural BMPs, followed
by structural BMPs. The director may require additional BMPs to be implemented
for any discharge from a commercial, residential, or industrial source.
   B.   Spill BMPs: All persons and industrial facilities shall take measures
to prevent spills or any other accidental introduction of pollutants into the
MS4. These measures shall take the form of BMPs. (Ord. 1910 § 2, 2007)
13.44.060: INSPECTIONS AND SAMPLING:
   A.   Right Of Access: The director or the director's authorized
representative bearing credentials, shall be permitted to gain access to such
premises as may be necessary for the purpose of inspecting, observing,
measuring, sampling and testing, as often as may be necessary, to determine
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Inspections: The director, or the director's authorized representative
bearing credentials, retains the right to perform inspections at any industrial
facility or any other premises that discharges, or has the potential to
discharge, stormwater into the MS4. Whenever an inspection of such premises is
made, the findings shall be recorded and a copy of the inspection report made
available to the owner or person in charge of such premises, after finalization
of the inspection report. (Ord. 1910 § 2, 2007)
13.44.065: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
The following enforcement provisions are intended to encourage compliance with
this chapter:
   A.   Notice Of Violations: Whenever the director determines that a violation
of this chapter has occurred or is occurring, the director may issue a notice
of violation (NOV) to the person or industry. This NOV shall include the nature
of the violation and provide a reasonable time for correction. The director may
require, within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of this NOV, an explanation of
the violation and the remedial plan the violator has implemented for the
satisfactory correction and prevention, including any specific required
actions. The explanation and plan shall be submitted by the violator to the
director in writing. Submission of this plan shall in no way relieve the person
or industry of liability for any violation(s) occurring before or after receipt
of the NOV. Issuance of an NOV shall not preclude any other enforcement action.
   B.   Administrative Orders:
      1.   Consent Orders: The director is empowered to enter consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing a
consensus with any person or industry for noncompliance. Such an order shall
include specific action to be taken by the violator to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified in the order. Consent orders shall
be judicially enforceable.
      2.   Compliance Orders: When the director finds that a person or industry
has violated or continues to violate this chapter or orders issued hereunder,
the director may issue an order to the violator directing that compliance be
obtained within a specified time period. If compliance is not achieved within
the time period, water service or sewer service, or both services, may be
discontinued, unless adequate BMPs or other related appurtenances are installed
and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements
addressing noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring. A compliance
order shall not extend the deadline for compliance established by a federal
standard or requirement, nor shall a compliance order release the violator from
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not preclude any other enforcement action. Compliance
orders may specifically include a provision directing the violator to cease and
desist all such violations or activities likely to cause a recurrence, and take
such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be necessary to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations or
terminating the discharge.
      3.   Administrative Orders: Administrative orders may be revised by the
director at any time in order to ensure compliance with this chapter.
   C.   Administrative Fines:
      1.   When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the director,
upon good cause shown, may impose an administrative fine against such user in
an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines may be
assessed on a per violation, per day basis.
      2.   Notice of an administrative fine shall be served personally on the
user or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Payment of the fine shall
be received by the director within fifteen (15) days after such notice is
served.
      3.   Failure to submit payment in full for an administrative fine within
fifteen (15) days of service shall be considered a separate violation of this
chapter.
      4.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not preclude any other
action against the user.
   D.   Cost Recovery Of Expenses Incurred For Violation Of This Chapter:
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the director may require
any person and/or industry found to have violated any provision of this
chapter, or orders issued hereunder, to reimburse the city for any goods or
services used to remove pollutants from the city's MS4, or to prevent further
discharge of pollutants into the MS4. Said person shall also become liable to
the city for any expense, loss, or damages experienced by the city as a result
of a violation. The city may pursue its right of action to recover all such
costs, by utilizing any and all reasonable methods, including installment
payment administered by the finance department. The city may recover the costs
incurred by adding them to the utility bill of the violator or filing a lien on
the subject property.
   E.   Mitigation Of Pollutant Discharge To The MS4: Whenever it has been
determined or in the opinion of the director, a discharge of pollutants(s) to
the MS4 has the potential to negatively impact water quality or public safety,
the person responsible for the discharge may be required by the director to
mitigate and/or remove such pollutants from the MS4. Removal and/or mitigation
of the pollutant must occur within a reasonable time period, as determined by
the director. Removal and/or mitigation shall be considered complete at the
discretion of the director. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be a
separate violation of this chapter.
   F.   Water Supply Severance: Whenever a person has violated, or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, or orders issued hereunder, water
service may be severed. Service shall only recommence at the violator's
expense, after the violator has satisfactorily demonstrated an ability to
comply, and actual compliance.
   G.   Appeals: Any person aggrieved by any NOV, administrative fine or order
issued by the director pursuant to this section may appeal the action to the
city council as provided in this subsection.
      1.   The initiation of an appeal shall be in writing and filed with the
city manager no later than fifteen (15) days after service of notice of the
action appealed from. The written notice of appeal shall specify the action
appealed, detail why the action is in error, and specify provision of
ordinances or statutes supporting the person's appeal.
      2.   Upon receipt of a notice of appeal by the city manager, the city
manager shall conduct any necessary investigation into the basis of the appeal
and submit a written report to the council. The council shall hold a hearing
within thirty (30) days of receipt. However, upon review of the notice of
appeal, if the city manager determines that the basis of the appeal is patently
frivolous or filed only for purposes of delay, then the city manager shall so
report to the council without further investigation. The appellant shall be
notified in writing of the findings of the investigation.
      3.   A hearing on the appeal shall be commenced by the council no later
than thirty (30) days from the date of the written report of the city manager.
The city council shall have jurisdiction to affirm, modify, reverse or remand
the action of the director or the city manager upon good cause shown. Any
rulings, requirements, or decision of the council shall be final and binding,
provided that any right of appeal to the courts shall not be abrogated. (Ord.
1910 § 2, 2007)
13.44.070: VIOLATIONS, INJUNCTION AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
   A.   Injunctive Relief: Whenever a person or industrial facility has
violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, or orders
issued hereunder, the director, with the advice and counsel of the city
attorney and the approval of the city council, may petition the district court
for the issuance of an injunction, which restrains or compels the activities on
the part of the person or industry. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
preclude any other action against a person or industrial facility.
   B.   Criminal Prosecution: It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor offense
for any person to violate any of the provisions of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder. Any person convicted of a violation of this chapter, or any
order issued pursuant to this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor offense
and shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00), excluding costs, fees and assessments, or by imprisonment in the
city jail for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment. Each day, or portion thereof, during which a violation is
committed, continued or permitted, shall be deemed a separate offense.
   C.   Remedies Nonexclusive:
      1.   The provisions of section
13.44.065 of this chapter and this section shall not be exclusive remedies. The
city reserves the right to take any combination of actions against a violator
of this chapter. These actions may be taken concurrently.
      2.   The city may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
(Ord. 1910 § 2, 2007)
13.44.075: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data regarding a person, industrial facility or industrial
activity obtained from reports, surveys, OPDES stormwater discharge permit
applications or permits, monitoring programs, inspections and sampling
activities may be available to the public in accordance with the Oklahoma open
records act 1 , or to other government agencies unless the industrial facility
or industrial activity can demonstrate to the director's satisfaction that the

of insurance or reinstatement of such existing policy of insurance.
   B.   1. In the event a permit is authorized by the city under the terms of
this chapter for the drilling and operation of a well, no actual drilling
operation shall be commenced nor operation continue, until the permittee files
with the city clerk a bond in the principal amount of at least twenty five
thousand dollars ($25,000.00), or such higher principal sum as has been
determined by the commission, on all wells by a single operator on a single
lease. Said bond shall be executed by an insurance company authorized to do
business in the state of Oklahoma as a surety with the permittee as principal,
said bond running in favor of the city for the benefit of the city and all
persons concerned. If a bond meets all the requirements of this chapter, the
city shall accept a bond which also lists the state of Oklahoma or an agency
thereof as beneficiary.
      2.   In the alternative, permittee may file an irrevocable letter of
credit in an amount equivalent to the bond which would otherwise be required,
said letter of credit being issued by a bank having sufficient equity that the
letter of credit represents no more than five percent (5%) of the equity of the
issuing bank. The letter of credit shall be irrevocable, and shall be on terms
approved by the city manager. The letter of credit must be advised through and
confirmed by a bank located within the state of Oklahoma.
      3.   The bond or letter of credit shall expire one year after the date of
the issuance of the oil and gas permit; provided, that if either drilling or
production activities are to continue on the lease after the scheduled
termination date of the permit and security, a new bond or letter of credit
must be submitted to the city in advance of the expiration date of the old
security device, and must accompany an application for renewal of the permit.
Should the owner or operator fail to supply such security device and the
existing securities expire by virtue of their own terms, all further drilling,
production, or injection activities on the lease must immediately cease and the
well must be immediately plugged.
      4.   All security under this section shall be conditioned on the
following:
         a.   Permittee will promptly pay all fines, penalties, or other
assessments imposed upon permittee by reason of the breach of any of the
provisions dealing with the performance of oil and gas drilling or production.
         b.   Permittee will not destroy or will otherwise promptly restore to
their former condition, the streets, sidewalks and other public property of the
city which may be disturbed or damaged by the operations.
         c.   Permittee will, after drilling operations are complete, grade,
level, and restore all property at the surface condition as nearly as possible,
as existed when operations for drilling of the well were first commenced.
         d.   Permittee shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and
all liability attributable to granting the permit.
      5.   Although not covered by the terms of the security itself, permittee
will further sign a statement expressly agreeing:
         a.   To promptly clear the premises of all litter, trash, waste and
other substances used, allowed or occurring in the drilling or production
operations;
         b.   Acknowledging permittee's knowledge of, and willingness and
ability to comply with applicable federal and state law, municipal ordinance,
rules, regulations, standards and directives relating to the maintenance of the
safe and beneficial physical, chemical and biological properties of any waters
of the city or lands within the city;
         c.   That permittee will bear all the costs necessary and incidental
to the correction of any pollution of the waters of the city or lands within
the city caused by permittee or his agents, servants, employees, subcontractors
or independent contractors; and
         d.   Acknowledging that violation of any of the provisions of this
section subjects the permittee to loss of permit, civil action for damages, and
possible criminal action in municipal court.
      6.   In addition to the security required above, permittee shall carry a
policy or policies of standard comprehensive public liability insurance, letter
of credit or equivalent security approved by the city manager, including
contractual liability covering bodily injury and property damage, naming the
permittee and the city as coinsureds. Such security shall, in the aggregate,
provide for minimum coverage of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) combined
single limit with a maximum of twenty five thousand dollar ($25,000.00)
deductible.
      7.   Permittee shall file, with the city clerk, certificates of insurance
or other security approved by the city manager, and shall obtain the written
approval thereof by the city manager or his designee, who shall act thereon
within ten (10) days from the date of the filing of the documents. In the event
that the protection provided by these securities is terminated for any reason,
permittee's rights to operate under the oil and gas permit shall cease
immediately and the permittee may take no action other than plugging of the
wells until substitute securities are provided. (Ord. 1939 § 1, 2009: Ord. 1369

to the surface by normal displacement practices with sufficient cement to
completely fill all the annular space behind such casing, to the surface of the
ground. If cement cannot be circulated to the surface, the existing cement
shall not be over displaced and a plug shall be left in the bottom of the
casing string to be drilled out once the surface is set. The remaining open
hole behind the surface pipe shall be cemented by running a tubing string
between the conductor string and the service pipe until the top of the cement
is tagged. The remaining uncemented annular space shall then be cemented until
good cement is circulated to the surface. Cementing of this surface casing
shall be performed as soon as the depth described in subsection A of this
section is reached, and prior to drilling the well to deeper formations. A copy
of the cement log shall be filed with the city.
   C.   Where an existing well is to be used as an injection or disposal site,
the existing casing and cement shall be of such integrity and depth as to
adequately and safely isolate freshwater producing zones from the seepage or
bleeding of injection fluids or disposants. Where additional protective
operations are undertaken to comply with this paragraph, the city shall be
notified thereof sufficiently in advance in order to allow a city
representative to be present and observe such operations.

operator would expect under the conditions known. The bradenhead shall not be
welded. Bradenheads installed on the surface casing shall be set above ground
level and shall be equipped with fittings having a working pressure rating of
not less than the pressures which a prudent operator would expect under the
conditions known. The bradenhead pressure shall be checked at least once each
calendar month, and if pressure is found to exist, proper remedial measures
shall be immediately taken to eliminate the source and the existence of the
pressure. (Ord. 1939 § 4, 2009)
14.16.120: CHRISTMAS TREES AND WELLHEAD CONNECTIONS:
   A.   The Christmas tree and wellhead connections on each well drilled within
the city limits shall have at least a minimum working pressure and a minimum
test pressure which meets or exceeds the highest of the following three (3)
standards:
      1.   Corporation commission regulations for wells of the applicable
depth.
      2.   Environmental protection agency regulations for wells of the
applicable depth.
      3.   The standards which would be used by a prudent operator for a well
of the applicable depth.

14.20.020: SEPARATORS:
Separators shall be used at each well to adequately care for the output of the
well, of both oil and gas, without spraying oil through the separator vent
line. No gas shall be produced, wasted or allowed to escape through a separator
vent line at any time when the noise caused by such wasting, producing or
escaping of gas is audible for a distance of three hundred feet (300') or more
from the well. When it appears that an explosive mixture of gas may be
accumulating near the ground, the inspector may require that the well be shut
down until gas is dissipated. All separators shall be vented either separately
or through a manifold into a vent, the minimum height of which shall be twenty
feet (20') above the normal ground surface. The vent shall be not less than two
inches (2") in diameter. It shall not be closer than sixty five feet (65') to
the well hole, centerline of street, or the lease boundary. No separator shall
be used which has less than one hundred twenty five (125) pounds of working
pressure; provided, that all separators on which a pressure of greater than one
hundred twenty five (125) pounds per square inch shall be carried, shall be
tested by the hydrostatic method to at least one and one-half (11/2) times the
working pressure to be carried on said separator.
All vent lines shall be securely fastened with at least three (3) steel
guylines to each vent, the guylines to be securely anchored to "deadmen" buried
not less than two feet (2') underground and not less than twenty feet (20')
from such vent. (Ord. 1369 § 6B, 1979)
14.20.030: SUMP PITS:

constructed of combustible materials shall be located or permitted to remain
within fifty feet (50') of the derrick or any part of the derrick after April
14, 1979, where the permit for the drilling of such well is issued after April
14, 1979. (Ord. 1369 § 6F, 1979)
14.20.070: ELECTRIC WIRING:
All electric wiring on or about any derrick, buildings, structures or tract of
land upon which any well is drilled or put down, shall be run in accordance
with the ordinances of the city governing electrical wiring installations. All
electrical fixtures for lighting or power purposes used shall be of vaporproof
design. (Ord. 1369 § 6G, 1979)
14.20.080: DEEP DRILLING; DRILLING MUD:
Drilling below three thousand feet (3,000') shall be done with mud weighing at
least 8.8 pounds per gallon. The hole should be kept full of mud at designated
weight at all times until the producing sand is reached. The mud shall be
weighed at such intervals as may be determined by the inspector. When
withdrawing the drill pipe, the pipe shall be filled with mud after each eleven
(11) stands have been withdrawn. Drilling the producing oil sand, however, may
be done with oil in lieu of the use of any mud; provided, however, that if the
oil is in circulation, such oil shall not be over 30-B gravity with a
flashpoint of not less than three hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit (350°F) and
after being so used shall be by the operator turned into a circulation tank
instead of into the pits. If, at any time, weight of such mud is less than that
specified in this section, any inspector or officer of the city shall have the
right to suspend drilling and all operations in or about such well until the
weight of such mud complies with this section or the conditions of the oil
shall be made to comply with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1369 § 6H,
1979)
14.20.090: DISPOSING OF OIL PRODUCTS:
It is unlawful and an offense for any person, firm or corporation to deposit,
place, throw, divert, or in any manner dispose of or cause or permit to be
deposited, placed, thrown, diverted or disposed of within the corporate limits
of the city, any crude petroleum, oil or oily byproduct thereof, or any tar or
any product containing tar or any liquid with petroleum content or any oil
substance thereof upon the waters of any lagoon, creek or tributary thereof, or
upon the banks thereof or upon any land adjacent thereto which by reason of
this location may cause such petroleum, oil or liquid with petroleum content to
be deposited or diverted or may run or be transferred or carried into any
lagoon or creek or the banks or tributaries thereof, except that the city
council may permit the depositing, placing or discharging of mud or slush in
such places as they may approve or into pipelines properly approved by the city
council. (Ord. 1369 § 6I, 1979)

ditch, storm drain, sewer, gutter, paving, creek, river, lake or lagoon, any
oil or liquid with petroleum content or any oil substance or any mud, rotary
mud, sand, water or salt water, or in any manner to permit by seepage, overflow
or otherwise, any of such substances to escape from any property owned, leased
or controlled by such person, firm or corporation and to flow or be carried
into or upon such public highway, street or alley, drainage ditch, storm drain,
sewer, gutter, paving, creek, river, lake or lagoon within the corporate limits
of the city, except in such cases where mud or slush is carried in pipelines as

waste produced in connection with the drilling, cleaning, washing, reworking or
operating any oil, gas or disposal well shall be captured and retained until
transported to a proper disposal facility approved by the corporation
commission. The steel pit and its contents shall be removed from the premises
and the drilling site within thirty (30) days after completion of the well.
(Ord. 1939 § 5, 2009)
14.20.120: ABANDONED WELLS; RESTORATION OF PROPERTY:
It shall be the duty of every person, firm, corporation, or lessees owning any
oil or gas well within the corporate limits of the city, and of the officers,
agents and employees of such owners, in the event of abandoning operation
because of failure of the well or wells to produce oil or gas in paying
quantities, or for any other reason, to begin within a period of sixty (60)
days from the day of such abandonment and to continue in a workmanlike manner,
to remove all derricks, machinery, concrete foundations and any and all other
objects that interfere with the leveling of the land, and to grade, level and
restore the property to the same surface condition as nearly as possible, as
found when the oil or gas well thereon was first commenced. (Ord. 1369 § 6L,
1979)
14.20.130: PORTABLE PUMPING UNITS:
Every person, firm or corporation operating a portable pumping unit used for
the pumping of oil within the corporate limits of the city shall equip the
same, before the operation or use thereof, on both the suction and discharge
sides, with steel flexible tubing or pipe or tubing composed of some other
material that is approved by the chief of the fire department. All pumping
units shall be operated by electric motors and be equipped with proper belt and
pulley guards to properly enclose any moving parts as required by the city
inspector. A sign shall be posted which states that the unit operates on
automatic times and could automatically begin operation without warning. (Ord.
1369 § 6M, 1979)
14.20.140: FENCING:
   A.   Enclosure Required: Any person who completes any well for production,
injection or disposal shall enclose said well, together with the surface
facilities and storage tanks, by a substantial chainlink or wire mesh fence
eight feet (8') high with barbed wire at the top and properly built as to
ordinarily keep persons and animals out of the enclosure. All gates thereto
shall be kept locked when the permittee or his employees are not within the
enclosure. Provided, that the commission, either as part of the original permit
or as a part of any renewal thereof, may require, in addition to the fence or
in substitution therefor, visual screening of a type to be specified; the
commission may ban walking beams on the surface, instead requiring submersible
pumps and/or enclosed or buried structures. Once erected, all fences and visual
screening and landscaping shall be properly maintained. (Ord. 1939 § 5, 2009)
14.20.150: NOISE, DUST, ODORS, AND OTHER NUISANCES:
   A.   All oil or gas drilling and production operations shall be conducted in
such a manner as to eliminate, as far as practical, dust, noise, vibration, or
noxious odors, and shall be in accordance with the best accepted practices
incident to the drilling for, and production of, oil, gas, and other
hydrocarbon substances. Proven technological improvements in exploration,
drilling and production methods shall be adopted as they become, from time to
time, capable of reducing factors of nuisance and annoyance in accordance with
prudent practices in the industry.
   B.   At the time of authorizing the permit or renewal is granted, the
commission may specify hours of operation to reduce or eliminate noise when
drilling takes place within one thousand feet (1,000') of a hospital, rest
home, school (including preschools and nurseries), church, or place of public
assembly; these limits do not apply to emergency repairs necessary to meet
safety requirements. The commission may restrict operations between eleven
o'clock (11:00) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. on any day, and during
regularly scheduled public meetings for a period not to exceed four and one-
half (41/2) consecutive hours, as is required by the circumstances to be
compatible with the specified public use. (Ord. 1939 § 5, 2009)
14.20.160: PRODUCTION REPORT; PLUGGING AND RESTORATION:
   A.   The operator of any natural or artificially producing well shall file
with the city a quarterly report accurately stating that the well produced more
than twenty (20) barrels of crude oil or other hydrocarbon substances, or
produced more than one hundred thousand (100,000) cubic feet of gas during the
last quarter. The report shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the end of
each calendar quarter. Failure to file such a report is an offense and is also
an admission by the operator that the well did not operate that quarter.
   B.   Within ninety (90) days after any well is abandoned, the permittee and
the operator of the well shall plug the well in a manner which meets or exceeds
the requirements of the corporation commission and the environmental protection
agency. No surface casing or conductor string may be pulled or removed from the
well. Within six (6) months of ceasing operations voluntarily, or of
abandonment, all lands upon which a drilling or production operation was
conducted shall be restored as nearly as practicable to the previous topography
by the permittee and the operator, unless the commission excuses restoration in
this form. Upon the failure to comply with this section, the city, directly or
under contract with others, may proceed to plug the well, restore the surface
and recover its costs under the bonds.
   C.   In the event a rupture, break or opening occurs on the surface or
production casing, the permittee, the operator and the drilling contractor
shall each take action to repair it, and shall each report the incident to the
city promptly. Actual repairs and actual reporting to the city by one shall be
considered adequate; however, a mistaken belief held in good faith that others
have performed as required does not relieve the permittee, the operator or the
drilling contractor of their independent obligations, nor does it provide a
defense to a prosecution for violation of this section.
   D.   Copies of all applications, notices, forms, records, logs, and like
documents filed by either the permittee or the operator with the corporation
commission or the environmental protection agency shall be filed with the city
within one week of filing with the corporation commission or the environmental
protection agency. All such items filed under this section shall be kept
confidential to the same extent as the state and federal laws, and the rules of
the corporation commission or the environmental protection agency, require the
submitted material to be kept confidential. Actual notice of all hearings
concerning the well or the lease shall be given the city, sufficient to allow
proper preparation and attendance by the city attorney or his designated
representative. (Ord. 1939 § 5, 2009)
14.20.170: STORAGE TANKS:
No person shall use, construct or operate, in connection with any producing
well within the city limits, any crude oil storage tanks except to the extent
of two (2) steel tanks for oil storage, not exceeding five hundred (500)
barrels' capacity each, and so constructed and maintained as to be vaportight.
Each tank shall be surrounded by an earthen firewall at such distance from the
tanks as will under any foreseeable circumstances hold and retain at least one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the maximum capacity of such tank. The
permittee may use, construct and operate a steel conventional separator, and
such other steel tanks and appurtenances as are necessary for treating oil,
with each of such facilities to be so constructed and maintained as to be
vaportight. Each oil/gas separator shall be equipped with both a regulation
pressure release safety valve and a bursting head. No such tanks may be located
within three hundred feet (300') of a residence, or within three hundred feet
(300') of any building or structure not owned by the permittee, or permittee's
employees and contractors. (Ord. 1939 § 5, 2009)
14.20.180: GASEOUS DISCHARGES TO THE ATMOSPHERE:
No gaseous discharges to the atmosphere will be permitted from any producing
injection or disposal well. The permittee shall use well maintained and
adequate equipment on site to gather any such gaseous discharge and prevent its
being vented to the atmosphere during the collection process, storage process,
or transportation within the city limits. Flaring will be permitted for testing
purposes and as needed to complete the well; however, commencing ninety (90)
days after drilling operations on the well cease, no flaring of gas will be
permitted. All such gas must be captured, and reinjected or collected in a low
pressure system. (Ord. 1939 § 5, 2009)

determination shall be made by the city engineer prior to the issuance of
building permit.
   B.   The city engineer shall also have the discretion to request a drainage
plan for smaller improvement projects which present a particular or unique
drainage problem to surrounding properties or adversely impact existing storm
drainage systems in the immediate area. The city engineer will review these
projects on a case by case basis and apply the standards outlined in this
chapter to evaluate potential downstream effects of each improvement. (Ord.
1628 §§ 1, 3, 1988)
16.26.030: DRAINAGE CONSTRUCTION PLANS:
   A.   To facilitate review, the drainage plan should have the drainage areas
delineated on it. The drainage plan should also show the location and size of
each channel and structure and the applicable flow rates (Q's) to each.
   B.   An engineer's report shall be submitted with drainage plans. The report
shall include the following:
      1.   Drainage area (DA) at each structure;
      2.   Flow rate (Q) at each structure and the computations leading to the
flow rate determination based on the rational method Q = CIA
 
Where:
*Q = The peak runoff rate (cfs)
C  = The runoff coefficient (dimensionless)
*I = The average rainfall intensity (in./hr)
A  = The size of the drainage area (acres)
 
* A rainfall intensity (I) of 2.5 in./hr. can be used if no other historical
data is available;
      3.   The effects that the proposed development will have on the existing
storm sewer collector system.
   C.   The grading plan shall be to a minimum scale of one inch equals one
hundred feet (1" =100') showing existing and proposed finished two foot (2')
contours.
   D.   Lots shall be graded such that water from one lot does not drain across
more than two (2) adjacent lots, before it reaches an improved channel or
street. A drainageway shall be constructed to intercept stormwater, unless the
drainage from all lots is sloped to the abutting streets.
   E.   Storm Sewers:
      1.   Shall carry as a minimum the Q10 flow *(Q10 = 10-year return
frequency);
      2.   Shall have a velocity greater than or equal to 3 FPS;
      3.   Shall have inlet computations and nomographs submitted in the
engineer's report.
   F.   Plans for open channels shall show:
      1.   Typical sections;
      2.   Slope of channel;
      3.   Profile and stationing of channel along centerline;

      5.   3 FPS < Velocity < 6 FPS for Bermuda grass lined channel;
      6.   Side slope on grass lined slopes of 3:1;
      7.   Existing flowline elevations shown for a distance of one hundred
feet (100') beyond the beginning and end of storm drainage.
   G.   Manning's "n":
      1.   Grass lined channel, n = 0.030;
      2.   Concrete-lined channel, n = 0.015;
      3.   Reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), n = 0.013;
      4.   Corrugated galvanized metal pipe (CGMP), n = 0.024.
   H.   Rational formula "C":
      1.   "C" residential = 0.40 to 0.70;
      2.   "C" commercial = 0.50 to 0.90;
      3.   "C" industrial = 0.60 to 0.90. (Ord. 1628 §§ 1, 4, 1988)
16.26.040: REQUIREMENTS SUBSEQUENT TO ACCEPTANCE OF PLAN:
   A.   Subsequent to the acceptance of a drainage plan for a subdivision, and
prior to the approval of the final plat or replat of the subdivision, the
developer or owner shall complete all detention and drainage facilities called
for in the drainage plan. Upon completion of the designated improvements, the
developer or owner shall submit as built drawings to the city engineer for
review and acceptance.

   A.   Validity Of Other Laws And Ordinances: Where this zoning code imposes a
lesser restriction upon the use of structures or land or upon height or bulk of
structures, or requires more open space or yards than are imposed by other
ordinances, laws or regulations, the provisions of this zoning code shall not
be construed to prevent the enforcement of other ordinances, laws or
regulations which prescribe more restrictive limitations.
   B.   Severability: Should a court having jurisdiction adjudge any portion of
this zoning code invalid or unconstitutional, the remainder of this zoning code
shall remain in full force and effect.
   C.   Tense And Definition: For the purpose of this zoning code certain terms
and words are to be used and interpreted as defined in this title; words used
in the present tense shall include the future tense; words in the singular

17.01.050: ANNEXED TERRITORY:
When any territory shall be brought into the zoning jurisdiction of the city of
Okmulgee, Oklahoma, by annexation or otherwise, unplatted land shall be zoned
at the time of annexation as agricultural. When any territory shall be brought
into the zoning jurisdiction of the city of Okmulgee, Oklahoma, by annexation
or otherwise, platted land shall be zoned at the time of annexation as the
least dense use category that allows any existing use or existing and vacant
lots to be conforming; in the event that the use and the lot size cannot both
be accommodated, the existing primary use shall be controlling. Provided
further, that if county zoning has been granted within five (5) years prior to
annexation, such territory may be allowed to retain the most nearly comparable
municipal zoning status as it may have had under the county, even if the land
is unused or unplatted. This provision shall not operate to preclude subsequent
zoning of such property by amendment in the manner set forth hereafter. (Ord.

17.02.150: SCREENING WALL OR FENCE:
   A.   Specifications: For the purpose of maintaining a compatible
relationship between certain land uses, a screening requirement is hereby
established for the initiation and continuance of particular uses in such
instances as may be hereinafter designated. When the provisions of this zoning
code require the construction of a screening wall or fence as a condition for
the initiation and subsequent continuance of a use, a screening wall or fence:
      1.   Shall be designed, constructed and arranged to provide visual
separation of uses;
      2.   Shall not be less than six feet (6') in height;
      3.   Shall be constructed with all braces and supports on the interior,
except when both sides are of the same design and appearance;
      4.   Shall be erected prior to the occupancy of the building or
initiation of the use required to screen;
      5.   Shall be of live shrubbery or standard, conventional opaque fencing
material, and appropriate screening including wooden or vinyl fences with cap
rails and base rails, landscaping, or masonry walls or any combination of the
above.
   B.   Maintenance: Maintenance of the screening wall or fence shall be
maintained by the owner of the lot containing the use required to construct the
screening. Failure to maintain after a notice by the city of Okmulgee shall
constitute an offense hereunder.
   C.   Modification Of The Screening Wall Or Fence Requirements: The Okmulgee
board of adjustment, as a variance may:
      1.   Modify or remove the screening requirement where existing physical
features provide visual separation of uses;
      2.   Modify the screening requirement where an alternative screening will
provide visual separation of uses;
      3.   Grant an extension of time to erect a screen where properties which
are to be benefited by the screen are undeveloped; and

17.02.170: MAJOR STREET PLAN:
The city of Okmulgee street and highway plan as designated in the Okmulgee
comprehensive plan, hereinafter referred to as the major street plan, as
adopted by the Okmulgee city council, is hereby made a part hereof. All public
streets hereafter constructed shall be built and named in accordance with that
plan. Hereafter, all newly constructed or renamed thoroughfares will be
designated streets if they are aligned generally east to west, and designated
as avenues or roads if they are aligned generally north to south. Hereafter,
all newly constructed or renamed thoroughfares will be designated with a number
as the name of the street, if they are located in the southern portion of the
city and are generally aligned east to west. (Ord. 1953, 2010)
17.02.180: CONFLICT OF INTEREST:
The mayor or any member of the city council, planning commission or board of
adjustment to whom some private benefit, direct or indirect, financial or
otherwise, may come as a result of a public action concerning this zoning code,
shall not be a participant in that action. The possibility, not actuality, of a
conflict shall govern. The individual experiencing a conflict of interest shall
declare the interest, abstain from voting on the matter, and refrain from any
deliberations on the matter. The individual shall not discuss the matter with a
fellow official for the purpose of influencing a decision thereon. (Ord. 1953,
2010)
17.02.190: SPECIAL USES (SU):
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   The city council may, after a public hearing and recommendation by
the planning commission and after conducting a public hearing as is required,
authorize for specific parcels of land a special use through issuance of a
permit for said use in the zoning district in which it is located.
      2.   The special uses listed in the different zoning districts are so
classified because they more intensely dominate the area in which they may be
permitted than do other uses permitted by right in the zoning district;
however, the nature of such uses may make it desirable that they be permitted
to locate therein. Care shall be taken that, when permitted, the special use is
properly integrated with other land uses located in the area.
      3.   The designation of a special use as possible in principal uses
permitted list in a given district does not constitute an authorization or an
assurance that such use will be permitted. Rather, each special use application
shall be evaluated as to its probable effect on the adjacent property and
community welfare and may be approved or denied as the findings indicate
appropriate.
   B.   Conditions For Approval:
      1.   In considering and determining its recommendation, the planning
commission shall require that the applicant furnish plans and data concerning
the operation, location, function and characteristics of any use of land or
building proposed.
      2.   The planning commission may recommend to the city council that
certain safeguards and conditions concerning setbacks, ingress and egress, off
street parking and loading arrangements and location or construction of
buildings and uses and operation be required.
      3.   The city council may, in the interest of the public welfare and to
assure compliance with the intent of this title, require such development
standards and operational conditions and safeguards as are indicated to be
important to the welfare and protection of adjacent property and the community
as a whole.
      4.   A site plan setting forth the conditions specified may be required
of the applicant and such plan when accepted shall be made a part of the permit
issued for the special use.
      5.   A special use approved under the provisions of this title shall not
be considered as an amendment to the zoning ordinance; however, the special use
shall be noted on the zoning map as follows: "SU-          " (the case number
of the granted special use shall be inserted). Any of the conditions contained
in an approved special use shall be considered as conditions precedent to the
granting of a building permit for the special use allowed.
   C.   Time Limit: If for any reason the approved special use ceases operation
for a period of one year, then the approval of said special use shall be
considered void and will require another application, public hearing and review
by the planning commission and city council. Any approved special use that does
not begin operation within one year of approval shall be considered void,
unless orderly and diligent progress toward completion of construction is
taking place.
   D.   Use Conditions: Special uses permitted shall comply with the most
restrictive yard and height requirements of the district in which located. No
use shall commence, nor any construction be permitted, unless the special use
has been approved by the planning commission and complies with a review by the
community development department.
   E.   Administration Of Special Uses: An application for a special use shall
be filed with the planning commission by the owner of the property concerned,
or duly authorized representative thereof, on a standard form furnished by the
community development department. Applications for a special use may be
required to be accompanied by a scaled site plan of the proposed area. Notice
of a public hearing to consider a special use shall be the same as that for
rezoning. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining the names of all the
property owners, through a licensed abstract or title company, while the
community development department staff shall be responsible for the mailing of
all notices. (Ord. 1953, 2010)

17.04.040: Bulk And Area Requirements
17.04.050: Special Uses, Requirements
17.04.010: PURPOSES:
The Residential Districts are designed to:
   A.   Achieve the residential objectives of the comprehensive plan.
   B.   Protect the character of residential areas by excluding nonharmonious
commercial and industrial activities.
   C.   Achieve a suitable environment for families by permitting in
residential areas appropriate neighborhood facilities, such as churches,
schools, and certain cultural and recreational facilities if appropriate
safeguards are present.
   D.   Preserve openness of living areas and avoid overcrowding by requiring
minimum yards, open spaces, lot areas, and by limiting the bulk of structures.
   E.   Permit a variety of dwelling types and densities to meet the varying
needs of families.
   F.   Control the density of residential development to facilitate the
planning for an economical provision of streets, utilities, flood control, and
other public facilities.
Residential Estate District: The RE District is designed to permit the
development and conservation of single-family detached dwellings in a suitable
environment for family life on large parcels of land at a low population
density. It is the intent of this district to prohibit any other use that would
substantially interfere with the stated purposes of this district, and
discourage any use that generates traffic and creates congestion on
neighborhood streets other than normal traffic serving the residents on those
streets. All land in the R1 Zoning District under the 1964 Zoning Code which
has a lot size of two and one- half (21/2) acres or more in a single lot shall
be presumed to be RE under this title unless an application for a zoning change
is filed within ninety (90) days of the passage of this title.
Residential Single-Family District: The RS Districts are designed to permit the
development and conservation of single-family detached dwellings in suitable
environments in a variety of densities to meet the varying requirements of
families. All land in the R1 Zoning District under the 1964 Zoning Code which
has a lot size of more than seven thousand one hundred fifty (7,150) square
feet, shall be presumed to be RS-1 under this title unless an application for a
zoning change is filed within ninety (90) days of the passage of this title.
All other land in the R1 Zoning District under the 1964 Zoning Code shall be
presumed to be RS-2 under this title unless an application for a zoning change
is filed within ninety (90) days of the passage of this title.
RS-3 Districts: RS-3 Districts shall be generally intended for developments
with common ownership or control that leases property with a smaller footprint
while continuing to maintain common areas. Spot zoning to RS-3 shall be
generally discouraged in areas of RS-1 and RS-2 developments where the intent
is to split current lots into multiple RS-3 properties.
Residential Duplex District: The RD District is designed to permit a more
intense yet compatible use of tracts in or near single-family detached
residential and other neighborhoods which because of size, topography, or
adjacent land use are not ideally suited for single-family use. RD Districts
may also serve as a transitional buffer between less dense Residential
Districts and nearby Industrial, Office, and Commercial Districts. All land in
the R2 Zoning District under the 1964 Zoning Code shall be presumed to be RD
under this title unless an application for a zoning change is filed within
ninety (90) days of the passage of this title.
Residential Multiple-Family District: The RMF District is designed to permit
the development and conservation of multi- family dwelling types, in suitable
environments in a variety of densities to meet the varying requirements of
families. All land in the R3A, R3B, R3C, or R3D Zoning Districts under the 1964
Zoning Code shall be presumed to be RMF under this title unless an application
for a zoning change is filed within ninety (90) days of the passage of this
title.
Residential Manufactured Home Park District: The RMH District is designed to
permit manufactured home living as a residential use yet requiring regulation
to ensure a suitable living environment. All land in the R4 Zoning District
under the 1964 Zoning Code shall be presumed to be RMH under this title unless
an application for a zoning change is filed within ninety (90) days of the
passage of this title. (Ord. 2128, 2019: Ord. 1953, 2010)

17.07.030: Accessory Uses
17.07.040: Bulk And Area Requirements
17.07.050: Access Requirements
17.07.010: PURPOSES:
The highway corridor is an overlay established to allow and encourage high
intensity multifunctional development, in compliance with an approved site
plan, within appropriate highway corridors and as set forth in the Okmulgee
comprehensive plan in order to:
   A.   Allow for the development of a diversity of intense uses which benefit
from mutual proximity and from the immediate service of high capacity
thoroughfares.
   B.   Maximize the interrelationship between land use and transportation and
in particular encourage development patterns compatible with the evolution of
transit systems.
   C.   Maximize the utilization of the higher capacity segments of area and
regionalize the transportation systems.
   D.   Encourage a more productive use of land consistent with the public
objectives and standards of accessibility and land use compatibility.
   E.   Establish criteria for developing in accordance with the Okmulgee
comprehensive plan in this special overlay district keeping in mind the
following:
      1.   Compatibility with adjacent and abutting planned land uses.
      2.   Strip development should be avoided by assembling small parcels, to
result in a more orderly pattern of development and improved points of ingress
and egress along and throughout this special district.
      3.   Through traffic into adjacent low intensity residential districts
shall be discouraged by designing collector streets that will not function as
direct avenues of neighborhood cut through.
      4.   Parking areas within medium and high intensity developments shall be
screened from abutting residential areas and collector streets by an opaque
fence with or without vegetative screening that shall be a condition of
approval and shall be maintained as a continuing condition of occupancy and use
of the land.
      5.   Setbacks and other buffer areas shall be used in combination with
screening to improve compatibility of medium and high intensity uses with
adjacent and planned low intensity uses.
      6.   The granting of medium and high intensity zoning shall be
conditioned upon each such request that is located at the edges of a planned
medium or high intensity area being its own buffer. More specifically, requests
for medium or high intensity zoning shall include areas of more restrictive
zoning along its periphery to discourage the potential for strip zoning in the
special zoning district that would not be in accordance with the Okmulgee
comprehensive plan.
      7.   Sign controls shall be established as a condition of approval to
assure a uniform character throughout the special zoning district to reduce the
impact of such signs on adjacent or abutting residential uses, to guard against
visual clutter and to provide increased safety to the traveling public.
      8.   Development sensitive areas, including, but not limited to,
floodplains, shall be shown on all proposals and given special attention in the
proposed development design.
      9.   The expansion of existing medium or high intensity land use or
zoning shall be granted only in accordance with the Okmulgee comprehensive plan
and the provisions of this special zoning district.
      10.   No residential development other than RMF shall be considered high
density. Any preexisting residential development will be encouraged to rezone
that portion of the highway corridor to a more appropriate use upon the
destruction or removal of the preexisting residential structures or the
cessation of the use.
   F.   Preserve the integrity of the Okmulgee major street and highway plan as
set forth in the Okmulgee comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1953, 2010)
17.07.020: PRINCIPAL USES:
The principal uses permitted in the highway corridor district may consist of
one or more of the use units permitted by right within the general zoning
district within which the highway corridor district is located. The use units
are grouping of individual uses and are fully described, including their
respective off street parking, loading, and screening requirements and other
use conditions in chapter 11 of this title. (Ord. 1953, 2010)

customarily incidental to the principal uses within the general zoning district
within which the corridor district is located.
   B.   Signs as principal uses shall conform to the requirements of the
general zoning district within which the highway corridor district is located,
provided, however, that signs in the highway corridor district, which are
accessory to permitted principal uses, are subject to the use conditions as set
forth in the general zoning district in which the corridor district is located.

17.07.050: ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:
In order that the integrity of the Okmulgee major street and highway plan as
set forth in the Okmulgee comprehensive plan shall be preserved and that the
traffic carrying capacity of U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive) be maintained and
protected, the following standards are established as follows:
   A.   For any corridor development on vacant, undeveloped rezoned land,
access shall be principally from internal collector service streets, and
traffic carrying capacity of U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive) shall be protected
within the special district.
   B.   Private parking areas that require mutual accessways shall be designed
to facilitate the development of the subject tract and adjacent properties.
   C.   The use of frontage roads along U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive) and the
major thoroughfares that abut the special district shall be encouraged for
medium and high intensity land uses.
   D.   Ingress and egress to medium and high intensity areas shall be planned
in such a manner as to not mix with or utilize those minor or local streets
that provide access to predominantly low intensity areas. Access to minor or
local streets from medium and high intensity areas is not in accordance with
the provisions of this special district.
   E.   Restrict the granting of curb cuts, median cuts, or traffic signals to
only those needed to address the requirements of planned development and as
permitted by the Oklahoma department of transportation.
   F.   Private access points to U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive) and adjacent
streets should be consolidated and limited in such a manner as to provide the
maximum degree of safety to the traveling public while recognizing the needs
for access from abutting areas. For lots with frontage in these areas, private
access points to U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive) are permitted and limited as
follows:
      1.   Shared driveways and access points are strongly encouraged for
adjoining lots having frontage along U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive).
      2.   One access drive per lot per one hundred sixty five feet (165') of
lot frontage along U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive).
      3.   For lots with less than one hundred sixty five feet (165') of
frontage, one access drive may be provided serving two (2) adjoining lots
through a mutual access agreement to serve those lots having frontage.
Provided, however, no more than one access drive may be permitted per combined
lot frontage of less than three hundred thirty feet (330').
      4.   Access drives onto adjoining streets shall be required to have the
nearest edge of the driveways no closer than forty feet (40') from the lot line
parallel to and bordering U.S. Highway 75 (Wood Drive).
   G.   All parking areas shall be paved with appropriate all weather material.

historic district shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of
such improvement and all interior portions which, if not so maintained, may
cause, or tend to cause, the exterior portions of such improvements to fall
into a state of disrepair. This section shall be in addition to all other
provisions of law or local ordinance or code requiring buildings or structures
to be well maintained.
   B.   The historic preservation commission shall utilize, hereafter, the
secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation in the issuance of
certificates of appropriateness, unless other design guidelines are promulgated
and adopted for the specific overlay zone. The standards are as follows:
      1.   Reasonable efforts shall be made to allow a compatible use for a
property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site
and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
      2.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, site and its environment should not be destroyed; the removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided, when possible.
      3.   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time, and alterations that have no historical basis and which seek
to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      4.   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment; these changes may have acquired significance in their own
right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
      5.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      6.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      7.   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      8.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
      9.   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
      10.   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired. (Ord. 1953, 2010)

In addition, the historic preservation commission shall review the application
and shall consider:
      1.   The degree to which the proposed work is consistent with the design
guidelines.
      2.   The degree to which the proposed work would destroy or alter all or

action on available alternatives.
After notice and public hearing, the city council shall vote to approve,
approve with conditions or deny such request to extend the stay period for an
additional sixty (60) days. Denial of a stay extension shall constitute
automatic approval and issuance of a COA for demolition.

property in question in any legal manner, except that no action shall be taken
that would place the property in danger of damage or destruction.
   E.   Action On COA; Time Limits: If no action has been taken, due to lack of
quorum or otherwise, on an application within forty five (45) days of
application receipt, the COA shall be deemed approved, except in those cases
where a continuance has been requested by the applicant.

preservation commission has extended the time for utilization. For the purpose
of this provision, utilization shall mean that the work authorized under a COA
has begun and is being diligently carried to completion.
   H.   Additional COA Provisions:
      1.   Nonconforming Work: Work initiated and being diligently carried to
completion or work completed on any building, structure, site, or area prior to

structure, site or area as HP by a previous owner of the property shall be
permitted to remain without the necessity of complying with the provisions of
this chapter.

preservation commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a
preliminary design or conceptual plan of the proposed work, provided however,
that any such preliminary approval or approval with conditions shall be subject
to the final approval of the COA application.

a) of a rehabilitative nature on an existing structure or building, and b) does
not include new construction or alteration, and c) involves only replacement of
existing elements with like materials, and d) work complies with the guidelines
for such work, and e) such work will have no material effect on the building or
structure, then the historic preservation commission staff may issue a COA,
noting “no material effect” and transmit the application to protective
inspections for issuance. (Ord. 2181 § 1, 2022: Ord. 1953, 2010)

decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all
the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
   B.   Administrative Stay Of Proceedings: An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the administrative official
from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment, after the
notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated

property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order granted by the board on due and sufficient cause shown.
   C.   Determination Of Classification: Where a question arises as to the
zoning district classification of a particular use, the board of adjustment,
upon written request of an administrative official may find and determine the

17.14.070: STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES:
   A.   Allowed Variances: The board of adjustment may grant such variance from
the terms of this zoning code as will not cause substantial detriment to the

the comprehensive plan, where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
shape, topography, or other extraordinary or exceptional situation, condition,
or circumstance peculiar to a particular property and not created by the
property owner or occupant, the literal enforcement of this zoning code will
result in unnecessary hardship. The board shall not vary any jurisdictional
requirement, such as notice. The board shall not permit by variance a principal
use not otherwise permitted in the applicable district, it being the expressed
spirit and intent of this zoning code that a change of the permitted principal
use shall be made solely by ordinance amendment of this zoning code or the
official zoning map. Provided that the board in granting a variance shall
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, and may require such evidence
and guarantee or bond as it may deem necessary to enforce compliance with the
conditions attached.
   B.   Time Limitation On Variances: A variance that has not been utilized
within one year from date of the order granting the variance shall thereafter
be void, provided that the board has not extended the time for utilization. For
the purpose of this provision, "utilization" shall mean actual use or the
issuance of a building permit, when applicable, provided construction is
diligently carried to completion. (Ord. 1953, 2010)
17.14.080: STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Allowed Exceptions: The board of adjustment upon application and after
hearing subject to the procedural and substantive standards hereinafter set

      3.   The placement of satellite antennas that do not meet all of the
standards.
      4.   Permit the various uses identified in particular zoning districts
that are not permitted by right, but are permitted by special use designation.
   B.   Compliance With Intent Of Zoning Code: The board of adjustment shall
determine whether or not special exception will be in harmony with the spirit
and intent of this zoning code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood
or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. Provided that the board in
granting special exception shall prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards, and may require such evidence and guarantee or bond as it may deem
necessary to enforce compliance with the conditions attached.
   C.   Time Limitation On Special Exceptions: A special exception which has
not been utilized within one year from date of the order granting same shall
thereafter be void, unless the board has expressly extended the time for
utilization in writing. For the purposes of this provision, "utilization" shall
mean actual use or the issuance of a building permit, when applicable, provided
construction is diligently carried to completion. (Ord. 1953, 2010)
17.14.090: APPEAL TO THE DISTRICT COURT:
Any appeal to the district court stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed from unless the chairman of the board certifies to the court
clerk, after notice of the appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril of life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order granted by the district court. (Ord. 1953, 2010)
