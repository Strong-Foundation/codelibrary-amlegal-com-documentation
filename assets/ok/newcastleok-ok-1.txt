shall be paid by the occupant to the operator, whether person, firm or
corporation, as trustee for and on account of the city. Each and every

the occupant the full amount of the tax levied by this section. Every person
required to collect any tax imposed by this section and, in the case of a
corporation, each principal officer thereof, shall be personally liable for
said tax.
   (G)   Records to be kept. Every operator shall keep records of every
occupancy and of all rent paid, charged or due thereon and of the tax payable
thereon in such form as the Clerk may by regulation require. Such records shall
be available for inspection and examination at any time upon demand by the
Clerk, or a duly authorized agent or employee of the city, and shall be
preserved for a period of three years; except that the Clerk may consent to
their destruction within that period or may require that they be kept longer.
   (H)   Returns.
      (1)   Every operator shall file with the Clerk a return of occupancy and
of rents and of the taxes payable on a per-month basis. Said return shall be
due from the operator and taxes payable thereon to the Clerk within 15 days of
the tax period accounted for in such return and is past-due 30 days from the
date of the tax period accounted for.
      (2)   Operators will deposit these specific funds in a separate account
for remission to the city.
   (I)   Payment of tax. At the time of filing a return of occupancy and of
rents, each operator shall pay to the Clerk the taxes imposed by this
subchapter upon the rents included in such return, as well as all other moneys
collected by the operator acting or purporting to act under the provisions of
this section. All the taxes for the period for which a return is required to be
filed shall be due from the operator and payable to the Clerk on or before the
date fixed for the filing of the return for such period without regard to
whether a return which is filed correctly shows the amount of rents and the
taxes thereon.
   (J)   Bond required.
      (1)   Where the Clerk believes that any operator is about to cease
business, leave the state, or remove or dissipate assets, or for any other
similar reason he or she deems it necessary in order to protect revenues under
this section, he or she may require such operator to file with the city a bond
issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state in
such amount as the Clerk may fix to secure the payment of any tax or penalties
and interest due, or which may become due from such operator.
      (2)   In the event that the Clerk determines that an operator is to file
such bond, he or she shall give notice to such operator specifying the amount
of bond required. The operator shall file such bond within five days after the
giving of such notice unless within such five days the operator shall request
in writing a hearing before the city’s Board of Adjustment or its designee, at
which the propriety and amount of the bond shall be determined by the Newcastle
Board of Adjustment or its designee. Such determination shall be final and
shall be complied with within 15 days thereafter. In lieu of such bond,
securities approved by the Clerk, or cash in such amount as he or she may
prescribe, may be deposited with the Clerk, who may at any time after five days
notice to the depositor, apply them to any tax and/or any penalties due, and
for that purpose the securities may be sold at private or public sale.
   (K)   Assessment and determination of tax. If a return required by this
section is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient,
the amount of tax due shall be assessed by the Clerk from such information as
may be obtainable and, if necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of
external indices such as number of rooms, location, scale of rents, comparable
rents, types of accommodations and services, number of employees, or other
factors. Written notice of such assessments shall be given to the person liable
for the collection and payment of the tax. Such assessment shall finally and
irrevocably fix and determine the tax unless the person against whom it is
assessed, within 90 days after the giving of notice of such assessment, shall
apply in writing to the city’s Board of Adjustment or its designee for a
hearing or unless the Clerk on his or her own motion shall reassess the same.
After such hearing, the city’s Board of Adjustment or its designee shall give
written notice of its determination to the person against whom the tax is
assessed and such determination shall be final.
   (L)   Refunds.
      (1)   Procedure. The Clerk shall refund or credit any tax erroneously,
illegally or unconstitutionally collected if written application to the Clerk
for such refund shall be made within two years from the date of payment
thereof. For like causes, and in the same period, a refund may be so made upon
the initiative and the order of the Clerk. Whenever a refund is made, the
reasons therefor shall be stated in writing. Such application may also be made
by the person who has collected and paid such tax to the Clerk, providing that
the application is made within two years of the payment of the occupant to the
operator, but no refund of money shall be made to the operator until he or she
has repaid to the occupant the amount for which the application for refund is
made. The Clerk, in lieu of any refund required to be made, may allow credit
thereof on payment due from the applicant.
      (2)   Determination and hearing. Upon application for a refund, the Clerk
may receive evidence with respect thereto and make such investigation as he or
she deems necessary. After making a determination as to the refund, the Clerk
shall give notice thereof to the applicant. Such determination shall be final
unless the applicant, within 90 days after such notice, shall apply in writing
to the city’s Board of Adjustment or its designee for a hearing. After such
hearing, the city’s Board of Adjustment or its designee shall give written
notice of its decision to the applicant.
   (M)   Notices. Notices provided for under this section shall be deemed to
have been given when such notice has been delivered personally to the operator
or deposited in the United States mail to the last known address of the
operator.
   (N)   Remedies exclusive. The remedies provided in this section shall be the
exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability
imposed by this section.
   (O)   General powers of the Clerk. In addition to all other powers granted
to the Clerk, the Clerk is hereby authorized and empowered:
      (1)   To make, adopt and amend rules and regulations appropriate for the
carrying out of this section;
      (2)   To extend, for good cause shown, the time for filing a return for a
period not exceeding 60 days; and for good cause shown waive, remit, or reduce
penalties or interest;
      (3)   To delegate his or her functions hereunder to an assistant or other
employee or employees of the city;
      (4)   To assess, reassess, determine, revise and readjust the taxes
imposed by this section; and
      (5)   To prescribe methods for determining taxable and non-taxable rents.
   (P)   Administration of oaths and compelling testimony. The Clerk, or his or
her designated representative, shall have the power to administer oaths and
take affidavits in relation to any matter or proceeding in the exercise of his
or her powers and duties under this section. The Clerk shall have the power to
subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books,
papers and documents to secure information pertinent to the performance of his
or her duties hereunder and the enforcement of this section and to examine them
in relation thereto.
   (Q)   Certificates of registration. Every operator shall file with the Clerk
a certificate of registration in a form prescribed by said Clerk within ten
days after the effective date of this section or, in the case of operators
commencing business or opening new hotels after such effective date, within
three days after such commencement or opening. The Clerk shall, within five
days after such registration, issue, without charge, to each operator a
certificate of authority empowering such operator to collect the tax from the
occupant and duplicates thereof for each additional hotel. Each certificate of
authority shall be permanently displayed by the operator in such manner that it
may be seen and come to the notice of all occupants and persons seeking
occupancy. Such certificates shall be non-assignable and non- transferable, and
shall be surrendered immediately to the Clerk upon the cessation of business at
the hotel named, or upon its sale or transfer.
   (R)   Interest and penalties.
      (1)   If any tax levied by this section becomes delinquent, the person
responsible and liable for such tax shall pay interest on such unpaid tax at
the rate of 1.5% per month on the unpaid balance from the date of delinquency.
      (2)   In addition to the interest, if a return is not filed and the total
amount of taxes due remitted within 30 days of the due date as defined in this
section, a penalty of 10% of the total amount of taxes due shall be assessed;
but if a return is not filed and/or the total amount of the taxes is not paid
after 60 days from such due date, the penalty shall increase to 25% of the
total amount of taxes due.
   (S)   Delinquent taxes. The tax levied by this subchapter shall be due and
payable at the time filing of the returns provided for in this section is
required. All taxes not paid within five days from the time they become due
shall be delinquent.
   (T)   Collection by suit. Such taxes and interest due hereunder shall at all
times constitute a prior, superior and paramount claim as against the claim of
unsecured creditors and may be collected by suit as any other debt.
   (U)   Use of funds. All taxes collected pursuant to provisions of this
section shall be used for the acquisition, development, replacement,
maintenance and/or repair of municipal equipment, buildings, roads, streets,
alleys, property or facilities.
   (V)   Records confidential. The confidential and privileged nature of the
records and files concerning the administration of the hotel tax is
legislatively recognized and declared, and to protect the same the provisions
of 68 O.S. § 205 of the state’s Sales Tax Code, and each subsection thereof, is
hereby adopted by reference and made fully effective and applicable to
administration of the city’s Transient Guest Room Tax as herein set forth.
   (W)   Proceedings to recover tax.
      (1)   Whenever any taxpayer or other person shall fail to collect and pay
over any tax or any tax penalty due and owing, or interest imposed by this
section, as herein provided, the City Attorney shall, upon the request of the
Clerk, take appropriate action to enforce the payment of the same.
      (2)   Further, pursuant to the authority of 68 O.S. § 2704, all taxes,
interest and penalties imposed by this section are hereby declared to
constitute a lien in favor of the city upon all franchises, property and rights
to property, whether real or personal, then belonging to or thereafter acquired
by the person, firm or corporation owing the tax, whether such property is
employed by such person, firm or corporation in the conduct of its business, or
in the hands of an assignee, trustee or receiver for the benefit of creditors,
from the date said taxes are due and payable under the provisions of this
section.
      (3)   Any sum or sums collected or required to be collected under this
section shall be deemed to be held in trust for the city; and, as trustee, the
collecting person, firm or corporation shall have a fiduciary duty to the city
in regards to such sums and shall be subject to the trust laws of this state.
Any person, firm or corporation who willfully or intentionally fails to remit
the tax, after tax levied by this section was collected from the occupant, and
appropriates the tax held in trust to his or her own use, or to the use of any
person, firm or corporation not entitled thereto, without the authority of law,
shall be guilty of embezzlement.
   (X)   Amendments. The people of the city, by their approval of this section
at the election herein provided, hereby authorize the City Council by ordinance
duly enacted, to make such administrative and technical changes or additions in
the method and manner of administration and enforcing this subchapter as may be

   (A)   Inspection fee. There is hereby levied an annual inspection fee and
service charge upon every person, firm or corporation operating a telephone
exchange or rendering telephone service in the city in an amount equal to 2% of

service rendered wholly within the corporate limits of the city to compensate

(2002 Code, § 36.03) (Ord. 408, passed 4-13-1998)
§ 36.04 VEHICLE USAGE POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. To set forth policies and guidelines for the usage and
assignment of city owned and operated vehicles. The primary purpose of this
policy is to establish procedures for the assignment of vehicles to departments
and specific personnel within those departments. For purposes of this section,
“city” and “Newcastle” are synonymous and may be used interchangeably.
   (B)   Background. The city owns and operates a fleet of vehicles utilized in
the accomplishment of its duties and responsibilities to the citizens of the
city which are assigned to various city employees and departments. For purposes
of this policy, heavy duty construction equipment, and stationary equipment,
are excluded. All police and fire vehicles are exempt as well.
   (C)   Policy. It is the policy of the city to maintain automobiles for use
by its employees while they are engaged in city business. This policy is
divided into a description of the types of assignments and the general rules
applicable to vehicle usage within these assignments.
   (D)   Types of vehicle assignment.
      (1)   Permanent assignment with take-home usage. The following guidelines
are to be followed for permanent take-home assignment by city personnel.
         (a)   The regular take-home privilege is restricted to those employees
residing within ten miles of the incorporated limits of the city who engage in
extensive evening work and those field employees on specific 24-hour call for a
specified length of time.
         (b)   Irregular eight-hour shift work extending into evening or early
morning hours does not justify vehicle take-home privileges.
         (c)   Possible emergency call out only does not constitute sufficient
cause for take-home privilege. However, the need for rapid response to
emergency calls can, and does, constitute justification for take-home
privileges.
         (d)   Work performed to and from a central work location only does not
constitute sufficient cause for vehicle take-home privileges.
         (e)   No vehicles are permitted to be taken home beyond ten miles
outside the incorporated limits of the city absent prior written approval from
the City Manager.
         (f)   Radio or other communications equipment will be assigned to take
home vehicles to ensure employee availability during use beyond normal office
hours.
         (g)   Take-home use is recognized as a privilege due to the nature of
the job and as a condition of employment.
      (2)   Permanent assignments for “daytime” use. One of the following
conditions must be met to justify a permanent assignment of a city-owned
vehicle to specific city personnel:
         (a)   The employee will use the car throughout the day, or shift, and
the vehicle is not effectively available for pooling; or
         (b)   It is one-of-a-kind vehicle carrying specialized equipment that
must be kept available so that a particular individual can perform his or her
assigned duties.
      (3)   Departmental pool assignment. One or more vehicles may be assigned
to a department based on the following conditions for sharing or pooling:
         (a)   No individual employee within the department needs to have
permanent access to a vehicle and the vehicle is for general use by a
department;
         (b)   Shift work, crew size or schedule of work dictates that the
drive will vary from day to day or week to week; or
         (c)   Pool usage is encouraged as opposed to automatic use of a
personally owned and operated vehicle.
      (4)   Use of personal vehicles. A personally owned and operated vehicle
may be used on city business, under the following conditions:
         (a)   An employee may use his or her own car for city business only
with prior approval of his or her supervisor; and
         (b)   A pool vehicle is not otherwise available.
   (E)   General rules and procedures.
      (1)   Every employee whose duties require him or her to operate an
automobile on city business shall have in his or her possession a valid state
driver’s license.
      (2)   Any fines incurred as a result of driving or parking violations
shall be paid by the employee. Violation of state or local laws related to
vehicular traffic shall be grounds for revocation of the privilege to drive
city vehicles.
      (3)   Time spent by an employee in driving a city or personal automobile
on city business during normal working hours shall be considered hours worked
for pay purposes.
      (4)   Automobiles are permanently assigned to those departments which
have demonstrated a continuing need for them.
      (5)   A change of employee status/duties will be reason for re-evaluation
of the need for assignment of a city vehicle.
      (6)   In the event of unusual or extraordinary circumstances, take-home
use of a city vehicle more than ten miles outside of the city limits may be
granted on a temporary or interim basis by the City Manager.
      (7)   All designated emergency response vehicles must be equipped
according to state statutes.
      (8)   Department heads will submit a list to the City Manager for
approval of employees whose jobs make it essential that he or she needs a take
home vehicle prior to January 1 of each year.
      (9)   Under IRS rulings, an employee’s use of an employer-provided
vehicle used to commute to and from work is a taxable benefit. The city has
chosen the “commuting value” rule as the method to determine the amount of
taxable benefit to each employee who chooses to drive a city-provided vehicle
which amounts equal to $3 per day. Fire and police vehicles, if used in
accordance with IRS regulations, are exempt.
      (10)   Employees who choose to use the employer-provided vehicle to
commute to and from work will have the taxable benefit of $3 per day (for days
actually worked) which shall be reflected on their yearly W-2 form.
      (11)   Employees who are assigned a city- owned vehicle cannot use the
vehicle for personal use other than commuting to and from work, except for de
minimus personal use such as stopping for a personal errand between work and
home and for meals taken in the course of employment.
      (12)   City-owned vehicles not being used for the commuting purposes or
after normal business hours shall be secured on city owned property unless
temporarily located elsewhere, such as for maintenance.

and administrative powers and shall receive reports relative to emergency
management activities.

§ 92.26 ABATEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   (1)   Whenever it is practical to do so, the City Council has the
power summarily to abate any nuisance, after notice to the owner and an
opportunity for him or her to be heard, if this can be done.
      (2)   Some nuisances are of a nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or the public generally, and it is recognized that, in such
circumstances, the City Manager or Mayor or his or her representative may be
justified or required to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate
the nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger, until more deliberate action
can be taken toward the abatement.
      (3)   The Fire Chief, the Chief of Police, the City Attorney, the Health
Officer, any Council member, any resident of the city or any other officer
subordinate to the City Council may submit to the City Council, a statement as
to the existence of a nuisance as defined by state law or the ordinances of the
city, and a request or recommendation that it be abated.
      (4)   The City Council shall determine whether or not the alleged
nuisance is a nuisance in fact, and before proceeding to have the nuisance
abated, the City Council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed
abatement to the owner of any property concerned and to any other person
alleged or deemed responsible for, or to be causing, the nuisance, and an
adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a hearing
can be given. The notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be
given in writing by mail or by service by a police officer, if his, her or
their names and addresses are known; if the names and addresses are not known,
and the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person, persons or
public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary
delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the city or county.
      (5)   If the City Council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it
shall direct the owner and/or other persons responsible for, or causing the
nuisance, to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety,
morals or welfare of the person, persons or public adversely affected would not
be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If the peace, health, safety,
morals or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner
or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within
the specified time, the City Council shall direct the City Manager, Building
Inspector or Mayor to abate the nuisance or have it abated, if summary
abatement is practical.
      (6)   The City Clerk shall send a statement of the cost of the summary
abatement to the owner and/or other persons responsible for, or causing, the
nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses
are known. Until paid, the cost shall constitute a debt to the city,
collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.
   (B)   (1)   The local or County Health Officer shall have the authority to
order, in writing, the owner or occupant of any private premises in the city to
remove from the premises, within a reasonable length of time and at his or her
own expense, any source of filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the
breeding of insects or rodents that might contribute to the transmission of
disease or any other condition adversely affecting the public health. Failure
to do so shall constitute an offense. The order shall be served on the owner,
occupant or his or her agent of the premises by the local or County Health
Officer or a police officer. If the premises are unoccupied and the residence
of the owner, occupant or agent is unknown or is without the state, the order
may be served by posting a copy thereof on the premises or by publication in at
least one issue of a newspaper having a general circulation in the city or
county.
      (2)   If the order is not complied with, the Health Officer may cause the
order to be executed, and the cost thereof shall be certified to the City
Clerk. The cost of abating the nuisance shall be added to the municipal utility
bill of the owner or occupant, if he or she is a user of any municipal utility
service, and shall become due and payable and be subject to the same
regulations relating to delinquency in payment as the utility bill itself. If
the owner or occupant is not a user of any municipal utility service, the
costs, after certification to the City Clerk, may be collected in any manner in
which any other debt due the city may be collected.
   (C)   (1)   When, in the opinion of the Building Inspector or any municipal
official, any building, wall or other structure upon, adjoining or near any
street, avenue, alley or public ground within the city becomes dangerous,
insecure or liable to collapse from inherent structural weakness or decay, or
which, from fire damage or other causes, becomes a menace to life or property,
the same is hereby declared to be a nuisance.
         (a)   Any building shall be reported by the Building Inspector or any
municipal official to the City Council, together with the lot and block number,
the owner or his or her agent and a description of the condition.
         (b)   Upon receipt of the report, the City Council shall, by
resolution, declare a building or structure to be a nuisance and shall serve
legal written notice on the owner or his or her agent to wreck or remove the
same.
         (c)   The resolution shall fix a time and a place at which the owner
or his or her agent may appear and show cause why the building shall not be
condemned.
         (d)   Upon the aforesaid date, the City Council shall hear all
objections and evidence in relation thereto and, unless the owner can show good
and sufficient reason why the building should not be condemned, the original
order of the City Council shall be executed, by resolution.
         (e)   The resolution shall fix a reasonable time for the owner to
comply with the order. At the expiration of the time, if the owner or agent has
not complied with the order, the City Council shall cause the building or
structure to be torn down.
         (f)   The materials salvaged in wrecking the building or structure
shall be sold at public or private sale and the proceeds therefrom used to
defray the city’s expenses in wrecking the building. Any unexpended balance
shall be returned to the owner. If the proceeds be insufficient therefor, the
balance shall be provided, by resolution, from whatever municipal fund
available, and the amount thereof shall be levied against the lot or tract of
land upon which the building was located in the manner provided by law for
assessment and levy of other special taxes.

§ 113.002 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, INTENT AND ] AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Findings. The regulations contained in this chapter are supported by
the following findings of fact:
      (1)   Oil and gas drilling and production is an important component of
the city area economy.
      (2)   Oil and gas well drilling and production activities create
conditions that potentially threaten the health, safety and general welfare of
persons residing or working on property in proximity to such operations.
      (3)   Oil and gas well drilling and production activities, in the absence
of local regulatory controls, may generate noxious aerial emissions, introduce
contaminants into groundwater, emit high noise or light levels, produce large
volumes of dust, congest local streets, present fire or chemical spill hazards
and produce other deleterious effects, all of which fall disproportionately on
adjacent land uses, and which can result individually or cumulatively in injury
to persons or damage to property and inhibit the quiet peace and enjoyment of
the surface uses of real property in the vicinity of such operations.
      (4)   The proliferation of oil and gas well pad sites within the city
creates conflicts between such development and other existing and future
surface uses of real property within the city. To assure the compatibility of
residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses with oil and gas well
development, it is necessary for the city to regulate the location of oil and
gas well operations relative to other surface uses of real property within the
city consistent with the right of mineral owners to reasonably access
subsurface resources.
      (5)   The city recognizes that the Oklahoma Corporation Commission
regulates oil and gas well drilling production activities. The regulations in
this chapter are intended to supplement such standards and additionally
implement compatible local measures that assure the health, safety and general
welfare of the city’s residents and businesses.
   (B)   Purpose and intent. In order to protect the public health, peace,
safety and welfare of the city and its residents, this chapter is created to
establish reasonable and uniform limitations, safeguards and controls for the
drilling and operation of wells and production of oil, gas and other
hydrocarbon substances within the corporate limits of the city, and to provide
that this land use may be conducted in harmony with other uses within the city.
The provisions set forth in this chapter shall be considered as minimum
requirements and shall not relieve any person from any duty imposed by law to
use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions for the safeguarding of
people and the protection of and noninterference with property rights.
   (C)   Authority. This chapter is adopted pursuant to authority vested under
the constitution and laws of the state. Each authorization identified in this
chapter shall be construed as an exercise of the city’s police, nuisance and
zoning powers pursuant to the state statutes and this code of ordinances.

§ 113.017 ORDER TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND OPERATIONS.
   (A)   If the City Manager or his or her designee finds that, in his or her
judgment, a hazard to life exists, he or she shall order immediate
rectification of the cause. If the permittee takes no immediate measure to
reduce the hazard, or the situation is so perilous as to constitute an imminent
threat to safety, then in either of these events he or she may order the prompt
suspension of activity, and if necessary the clearance of all non-essential
personnel from the premises.
   (B)   The appointed Inspector shall apply to the City Manager for a hearing
upon such order, which hearing shall be held not longer than 24 hours after the
issuance of the order by the Inspector. The City Manager shall determine if
proper cause existed, and, if not, shall order the permittee’s activity to
resume without delay. If the City Manager determines that proper cause did
exist for the order to cease activity to be issued, then he or she shall make
whatever ruling is proper to ensure rectification of the cause of the peril.
Such ruling and compliance with it by the permittee shall not be construed to
absolve the permittee of any liability for any violation of this chapter or for
any damage or injury caused thereby.

hearing the matter, may issue whatever ruling or order is appropriate, provided
that such ruling or order is in keeping with the spirit and purpose of this
chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 119.01 INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.
   (A)   General. In recognition that the generalized service industry
categorized as “massage parlors or providers” has proven to be a regulatory
problem in neighboring jurisdictions relating to ensuring that the services
provided are legitimate and legal services; ensuring the services provided meet
proper health standards; and ensuring the providers are trained and
appropriately licensed in the provision of services, the city has determined
that this industry shall be subjected to special regulation and adopts the
following regulatory provisions.
   (B)   Massage establishments; parlors and providers. These are allowed
service industries as a “use on review” only, which review shall be conducted
by the Planning and Zoning Commission with said Commission’s recommendation to
be approved by the City Council or the matter returned to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for further review and consideration with possible imposition
of appropriate conditions so as to address the concerns of said Commission and
the City Council. The following provide some of the matters to be considered in
determining the appropriateness of an application for a “use on review”, but do
not provide a complete or limiting statement of considerations. Each
application will be considered separately and independently based upon the
specific circumstances surrounding that application.
   (C)   Location restriction factors.
      (1)   A preferable factor shall be when a massage establishment is
located with and as an integral part of a related multi-service business.
Examples include, but are not limited to, physical therapy facilities, day spas
(facilities having some or all of the following services available: beautician;
cosmetology; barbering; manicurists; esthetician services; hot and dry saunas;
therapeutic massage; and the like) and medical facilities.
      (2)   A preferable factor shall be when a massage establishment is to be
located in a stand- alone, dedicated business facility.
      (3)   A discouraged factor shall be when a massage establishment is to be
located in malls or strip shopping centers with retail and professional service
providers of unrelated character.
      (4)   A massage establishment not existing as an integral part of a
related multi-service business shall not be located within 700 feet of a
school, commercial licensed child care facility, church or house of worship, a
medical facility (by way of example, but not as limitation, hospital, emergency
medical care facility, medical doctor’s office, or dentist office) or another
“massage establishment/ parlor”.

construction of the building, location of fixtures or for some other reason, it
would be impossible to abide by the letter of this chapter, he or she may apply
to the Building Inspector for a variance, stating his or her reasons for any
changes and setting forth the conditions, with a statement of his or her
desires to exceptions to the provisions of this chapter for the particular job.
If the Inspector finds that the conditions warrant the same and that it would

contractor or any combination thereof.
      (9)   The Building Inspector shall not approve any application for
contractor’s registration until he or she is satisfied that the contractor has

and FBFM) and any revisions thereto, which are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this subchapter as if fully set out herein, shall be
reviewed by the Planning and Community Development Department to ensure that
all of the following requirements are met. See also § 150.65 of this chapter.
      (1)   All building sites shall be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and
substantial improvement, including the placement of prefabricated buildings and
mobile homes, shall:
         (a)   Be designed, modified and/or adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; (All manufactured
housing to be placed within Zone A on a community’s flood hazard boundary map
shall be anchored by providing over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors.
Over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four corners of the mobile
home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate points, and
manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per
side. Frame ties shall be provided at each corner of the home, with five
additional ties per side at intermediate points, and manufactured homes less
than 50 feet long requiring four additional ties per side. All components of
the anchoring system shall be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds.
Additions to the manufactured home shall be similarly anchored.)
         (b)   Be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage; and
         (c)   Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages.
      (2)   All new and replacement water supply systems within flood-prone
areas shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems.
      (3)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (4)   On-site waste disposal systems within flood-prone areas shall be
located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them, during
flooding.
      (5)   The Planning and Community Development Department shall utilize all
available 100-year flood elevation data to review building permit applications,
and shall require that all applications for development within a flood-prone
area be accompanied by the elevation of the lowest habitable floor, including
basement, of all new or substantially improved structures; and a certificate
signed by a registered Oklahoma professional engineer stating that the flood-
proofing methods to be utilized are adequate to withstand the flood depths,
pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces, and other factors associated
with the 100-year flood, and indicating the specific elevation to which the
structure will be flood-proofed.
      (6)   All new construction or substantial improvement of residential
structures within Zones A1-30 on the flood insurance rate map shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the level of the 100-
year flood.
      (7)   Within Zones A1-30 on the flood insurance rate map, all
manufactured housing not in a park or subdivision, all new manufactured housing
parks and subdivisions, all expansions to existing manufactured housing parks
and subdivisions, and all repairs, reconstruction or improvement of streets,
utilities and/or pads in existing manufactured housing parks or subdivisions,
shall be located, developed, expanded, or improved according to the following
criteria:
         (a)   All manufactured housing shall be placed, or be capable of being
placed, on compacted fill or on pilings so that the lowest floor of the home
will be one foot above the level of the 100-year flood.
         (b)   All lots shall have adequate provisions for surface drainage and
access.
         (c)   All manufactured housing to be elevated on pilings shall be
placed on lots large enough to permit steps, provide for piling foundations to
be placed in stable or stabilized soils, no more than ten feet apart, and
provide for reinforcement of piers more than six feet above ground level.
      (8)   All new construction or substantial improvement of residential
structures located within any AO Zone shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated above the crown of the nearest street, one foot above the
depth number specified for the area on the flood insurance rate map.
      (9)   All new construction or substantial improvement of non-residential
structures within Zones A1-30 shall:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot
above the level of the 100-year flood; or
         (b)   Be completely flood-proofed, along with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, to one foot above the depth number specified on the flood
insurance rate map, so that any space below that level is water-tight, with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and contains
structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and the effects of buoyancy.
      (10)   The requirements of this chapter shall also be in effect for
building permit applications located within any A99 Zones.
      (11)   Floodways, as designated on the official flood hazard boundary
map, are hazardous areas due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris
and potentially damaging projectiles, and the creation of severe erosion
problems. The following provisions apply within designated floodway areas:
         (a)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments, unless certification by a
professional registered Oklahoma engineer is provided, demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         (b)   If the provisions of division (K)(12)(a) above are satisfied,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this code of ordinances.
   (K)   The Planning and Community Development Department shall have the
following additional responsibilities in the review of building permit
applications for development, location, demolition, or alteration within a
delineated flood hazard area:
      (1)   Building permit applications shall be reviewed to ensure that all
necessary governmental agency permits required by state or federal law have
been obtained.
         (a)   In the case of building permit applications for alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, the Planning and Community Development Department
shall:
            1.   Notify adjacent communities and the state’s Flood Insurance
Coordinating Office prior to the work and submit copies of the notification to
the Federal Flood Insurance Administrator; and
            2.   Obtain written assurances from the building permit applicant
that the floodcarrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
watercourse will be maintained.
         (b)   For the purpose of determining flood insurance risk premium
rates, the Planning and Community Development Department shall permanently
maintain records of:
            1.   The elevation of the lowest habitable floor of all new or
substantially improved structures; and
            2.    Flood-proofing certificates, including the specific elevation
to which the structures are flood-proofed.
   (L)   Issuance of a building permit for development within an identified
flood hazard area shall not create liability on the part of any municipal
official for any flood damages resulting from reliance upon the provisions of
this section, or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (M)   If the Planning and Community Development Department is satisfied that
the proposed work described in the application and attached materials conform
to the requirements of the adopted zoning ordinance, Building Code and other
regulations and requirements, he or she shall authorize the issuance of the
building permit by signing the application and forwarding it to the Planning
and Community Development Department who shall return a copy to the applicant.
   (N)   (1)   If the application or attached materials do not conform to
pertinent municipal regulations, the Building Official shall not approve the

Development Department, along with written reason(s) for disapproval. The
Planning and Community Development Department shall return the application,
with written reason(s) attached, to the applicant.
      (2)   The applicant may subsequently amend his or her application, if
possible, and re-submit it, or initiate other action to correct the
deficiencies.
   (O)   The Building Official and the Planning and Community Development
Department shall complete all required review processes in an efficient and
effective manner, without unreasonable or unnecessary delay.
   (P)   A building permit, once approved and issued, shall be construed as a
license to proceed with the work and shall not be construed as authority to
violate, cancel, alter or set aside any municipal regulations, nor shall the
issuance prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring a correction
of errors in plans or construction of a violation of this code of ordinances.
   (Q)   (1)   If the work allowed under an issued building permit has not been
initiated and if no inspections have been completed within six months from the
issuance date of the permit, the permit shall become null and void, unless a
request for an extension is submitted to, and approved by, the Planning and
Community Development Department.
      (2)   If the permit becomes null and void, a new permit must be obtained
and the regular fee incident thereto collected, in order for the work to be
initiated or resumed.
   (R)   Planning and Community Development Department shall keep a permanent
and accurate accounting of all building permits including all building permit
fee payments.
   (S)   The Planning and Community Development Department may revoke a
building permit in case there has been any false statement or misrepresentation
as to a material fact in the application or attached materials on which the
building permit approval was based.
   (T)   Building permits shall be conspicuously displayed on the project or
site in a manner visible from the street.

Planning and Community Development Department relative to the granting of
building permits, shall be taken to the City Council, who shall act as the
Building Permit Board of Appeals.
   (W)   In the event of any conflict between these building permit provisions
delineated herein and any provision(s) of the Building Code adopted by the City
Council, the provisions of this subchapter shall prevail.

otherwise result, the Building Inspector or Planning Director, at his or her
discretion, may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a period of 30
days and upon payment of a fee of $100 for a residential building permit and
$250 for a commercial building permit, only if there are no outstanding life
safety items as determined by the Building Inspector or Planning Director. A
temporary certificate of occupancy may be renewed monthly upon proper
application and payment of an additional fee of $100 for a residential building
permit and $250 for a commercial building permit, provided the maximum time a

This division shall run from the east city limits line to the west city limits
line.
      (3)   For purposes of addressing, the first mile east and west of U.S.
Highway #62 shall use a calculation of 330 feet for each hundred block, which
will result in 16 addressing blocks to the mile. The remaining areas to the
east and west city limits lines shall use a calculation of 660 feet for each
hundred block, which will result in eight addressing blocks to the mile.
      (4)   For purposes of addressing, the first mile north and south of Fox
Lane shall use a calculation of 330 feet for each hundred block, which will
result in 16 addressing blocks to the mile. The remaining areas to the north
and south city limits lines shall use a calculation of 660 feet for each
hundred block, which will result in eight addressing blocks to the mile.
      (5)   In instances where there are two short blocks on one side of the
street and one long block on the other side, house numbers shall be carried
across the street between the short blocks so as to conform with the numbers in
the long block.
      (6)   Streets running easterly and westerly should, as much as possible,
be numbered to correspond with the 100 block separation, as provided for
herein.
   (D)   East/west running streets shall be numbered. The use of “Terrace,”
“Place,” or similar identifiers may be used in cases where “Street” does not
accurately align with the appropriate one hundred block.
   (E)   North/south running streets shall be named. All names must be
deconflicted with McClain County 911.
   (F)   The Building Inspector, or a designated representative, shall
designate the numbers of all houses from an atlas maintained by the office of
the Planning and Community Development Department, in conformity with the
preceding provisions, and shall furnish the owner, occupant or agent of each
house (structure), unit, or parcel of real estate with its proper number. When
any house is not correctly numbered, or is unnumbered, the Planning and
Community Development Department shall give the house its proper number and
notify the owner, occupant, or agent of the same, and require that the number
be put on the house, mailbox or in a conspicuous place next to the street.
      (1)   House numbers shall be a minimum of four inches in height and half-
inch stroke.
      (2)   Commercial office or professional suites and units shall be
lettered A-Z; with A always beginning closest to Highway 62 or SH 130 and
increasing as address numbers increase in division (B) and (C) above.
   (G)   In situations where the plat or pattern of the area does not fit this
numbering system, the Planning Commission shall study the area and recommend to
the City Council, for adoption by ordinance, an appropriate amendment to this
section.
   (H)   Properties located at the intersection of two streets, also known as a
corner lot, shall be assigned only one address. The address shall be assigned
based on the buildable area created by the district’s setbacks.

§ 150.67 GREASE, OIL, AND SAND INTERCEPTORS.
   (A)   A grease interceptor shall be installed in the waste line leading from
sinks, drains or other fixtures in restaurants, hotel kitchens, cafeterias and
food processing establishments, and in any bar, lounge, private club or
fountain where food is prepared or served, or where dishes, glasses, pots, pans
or other kitchenware are washed, or any other establishment where grease or
broken glass can be introduced into the drainage system in quantities that can
cause line stoppage or hinder sewage disposal. Grease, oil and sand
interceptors are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing
grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other ingredients
harmful to the building’s drainage system, the public sewer or sewage treatment
plant process.
   (B)   Interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
residential dwelling units.
   (C)   All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity as defined in the
city’s current adopted Plumbing Code and shall be approved by the Building
Inspector. All interceptors shall be located so as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. The interceptors shall be properly
inspected following construction, by the Building Inspector, and shall be
maintained by the owner, at his or her expense, in continuously efficient
operation at all times.
   (D)   An oil separator shall be installed in the drainage system of any
establishment where, in the judgement of the Building Inspector, a hazard
exists or where oils or other flammables can be introduced or admitted into the
public sewer by accident or otherwise.
   (E)   All garages, filling stations and car washes having car wash racks or
facilities shall install combination grit and grease interceptors.
   (F)   All commercial laundries shall be equipped with an interceptor having
a removable wire basket or similar device that will prevent strings, rags,
buttons or other materials detrimental to the public sewage system from passing
into the drainage system.
   (G)   Bottling plants shall discharge all process wastes into an interceptor
which will provide for the separation of broken glass or other solids, before
discharging liquid wastes into the drainage system.
   (H)   Slaughterhouses shall equip all slaughtering room drains with a
separator which shall prevent the discharge of feathers, entrails and other
material likely to clog the drainage system.
   (I)   All existing establishments listed in division (A) above shall have 90
days from the effective date of this code of ordinances to install an improved
interceptor or separator. Establishments covered under division (D) above will
be handled on a case-by-case basis to determine whether an oil separator is
required. All establishments covered under division (A) above, constructed
henceforth, shall include an approved interceptor.
   (J)   The Building Inspector, Utilities Superintendent, City Manager or
Mayor shall have the right of entry during usual business hours, to conduct an
inspection of an interceptor or separator.
   (K)   (1)   Any person found to be in violation of this section shall be
served with written notice stating the violation and providing 72 hours for the
satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time
stated in the notice, permanently cease all violations.
      (2)   In the event an establishment is cited with a second violation
within six months of the first, the time allowed for correction shall be
reduced to 48 hours.
      (3)   A third citation within six months from the first violation will be
cause for the city to immediately discontinue water service to the
establishment for a period of not less than ten days during which time the
offender shall correct the violation.
   (L)   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in division (K) above and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined
in an amount not exceeding the limits established herein. Each day in which any
violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense.

discharge of his or her duties, shall not thereby render himself or herself
liable personally and he or she is hereby relieved from all personal liability

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in 82 O.S. §§ 1601 through 1618, as
amended, Ch. 23, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(2002 Code, § 152.01) (Ord. 340, passed 6-12-1995; Ord. 609, passed 10-8-2007;
Ord. 613, passed 11-13-2007)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services and extra- ordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated
flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(2002 Code, § 152.02) (Ord. 340, passed 6-12-1995; Ord. 609, passed 10-8-2007;
Ord. 613, passed 11-13-2007)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in a manner as to minimize future flood blight
areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(2002 Code, § 152.03) (Ord. 340, passed 6-12-1995; Ord. 609, passed 10-8-2007;
Ord. 613, passed 11-13-2007)
§ 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve the uses, be protected against damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(2002 Code, § 152.04) (Ord. 340, passed 6-12-1995; Ord. 609, passed 10-8-2007;

   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the state’s Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   (1)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
152.42(B) of this chapter have been fully considered.
      (2)   As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter. (See
§
152.03 of this chapter.)
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway, if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances.
      (3)   A written notice will be provided to any person granted a variance
to build a structure below the base flood elevation. This notice will inform
the variance applicant that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built
lower than the base flood elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use; provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in divisions (A) through (I) above are met;
and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.
   (L)   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the
Floodplain Board, accompanied by a filing fee of $25.
   (M)   A copy of any variance issued shall be sent to the OWRB within 15 days
of issuance.

(2002 Code, § 153.006) (Ord. 230, passed 9-8-1986; Ord. 651, passed 10-26-2009)
§ 153.007 EXCEPTIONS TO REGULATIONS; PLATTING REQUIRED.
   (A)   General provisions. A subdivision of land shall be classified by the
City Clerk as a deed approval subdivision if:
      (1)   An existing lot, tract, site or parcel of land is not subdivided
into more than three lots, tracts, sites or parcels or more than six lots when
an existing lot, parcel or tract is Zone A, Agriculture District, and is
abutting a section line road. The subdivision shall include all processes
related to the conveyance of title by:
         (a)   Deed by metes and bounds description;
         (b)   Deed described by reference to an unapproved plat; and/or
         (c)   Deed resulting from the adjustment of lot lines in an approved
plat.
      (2)   The subdivision does not involve or include the dedication or
abandonment of public rights-of-way and/or easements, provided however that for
a parcel that abuts a section line the applicant must provide a 50 foot right-
of-way dedication to the city allowing use for future roadways, utilities,
drainage, and other municipal uses; or
      (3)   The subdivision can satisfy these subdivision regulations and other
applicable ordinances and statutes without the construction of streets, water
facilities, storm drainage facilities or other improvements, except as
necessary to directly serve the created lots and to provide a direct connection
to an existing and approved system; it is the intent of this provision to limit
this classification to those cases where the improvements required by these
subdivision regulations have been provided and all such improvement
requirements, except for the extension of service to individual lots, have been
satisfied.
   (B)   Classification as deed approval subdivision not construed to waive
requirements. The classification of a subdivision as a deed approval
subdivision shall not be construed as a waiver of any requirements of these
subdivision regulations nor the provisions of any other ordinance or statute
pertaining to the property.
   (C)   Deed approval subdivision procedure. Processing a deed approval
subdivision shall be primarily administrative, as follows:
      (1)   Application for deed approval review shall be filed with the Office
of the City Clerk.
      (2)   The City Clerk, Building Inspector and/or City Manager shall review
the application and may submit it for review and comment to other agencies and/
or departments as necessary. Within ten days of the official date of
application, the Planning Commission Chairperson or Community Development
Director shall act on the application for deed approval by approving or denying
and shall notify the applicant of the decision. The applicant may waive this
requirement and consent to an extension of this period. If the application is
not approved by the Planning Commission Chairperson or Community Development
Director, the applicant may apply to the Planning Commission for public
hearing.
   (D)   Delegation of authority for administrative approval of deed. The
Planning Commission Chairperson or Community Development Director has the
authority to approve deeds either for lot split or metes and bounds approval
under the following conditions:
      (1)   Pre-existing deeds. The property conveyed by the deed submitted for
review existed in its present configuration prior to its annexation to the city
or prior to 6-7-1973 (adoption date of the original subdivision regulations
ordinance).
      (2)   Exempted deeds. Those deeds in which:
         (a)   The configuration of the property to be conveyed was created by
a court decree or by an action of other governmental authority; documentation
of such court decree or governmental action shall be required;
         (b)   The property to be conveyed is bound on all sides by properties
which have previously received deed approvals by the Planning Commission or by
the Planning Commission Chairperson;
         (c)   The deed submitted is exempted from the requirements of Planning
Commission approval by any provision of state law (documentation of such shall
be required);
         (d)   The property to be conveyed existed in its present configuration
prior to 6-7-1973, and meets the following criteria:
            1.   It is in compliance with all drainage ordinance requirements
and regulations;
            2.   Properties must front on approved streets;
            3.   All applicable zoning ordinance provisions and regulations are
met, including those regulations concerning non- conforming uses;
            4.   All current health ordinances and regulations are met;
            5.   All current drainage ordinances and regulations are met;
            6.   No more than three total lots, parcels, or tracts are being
created from a presently platted lot, parcel or tract or more than six lots
when an existing lot, parcel or tract is Zone A, Agriculture District, and is
abutting a section line road. The three-lot limitation shall not apply to the
minor subdivision of any commercially-zoned, platted lot greater than five
acres, subject to site plan review of the total parcel;
            7.   Instruments for the dedication of all necessary public
easements are submitted. This shall mean, in cases where public or private
easements are required that the applicant must submit certified copies of the
instrument(s) filed of record with the appropriate County Clerk;
            8.   The applicant has submitted a written agreement to extend all
sanitary sewer lines and water mains and has agreed that no improvement shall
be constructed on the property which would in any way affect the construction
of these sanitary sewer lines and water mains until these lines and mains are
in place and meet the standards of the city; where such extensions of sanitary
sewer lines and water mains are not reasonable, the applicant may submit a
written authorization for the use of individual sewage disposal facilities from
the state’s Department of Environmental Quality; in all cases where sanitary
sewer and/or water facilities are not available and the extension of facilities
are not required, the deed submitted for approval shall have affixed to its
face:
   “NOT SERVED BY PUBLIC SEWER
   AND/OR WATER AS OF THIS DATE”
in all cases where improvements or extension of improvements are required, the
provisions regarding assurance of completion; and
            9.   Approval of the deed submitted shall not create a substandard
lot on adjoining property. The deed submitted may be approved if the
substandard lot created on the adjoining property is combined with other
property to create a standard lot. Both deeds must be approved simultaneously.
      (3)   Authority. No further delegation of the Planning Commission’s
authority for the approval of lot splits or deed approvals is hereby granted or
implied.
   (E)   Paving. The city shall require the installation of proper street
paving with the approval of all deeds, if that paving does not already exist;
except that, the Planning Commission Chairperson may vary that requirement
under the following conditions:
      (1)   The residential lot is on an approved private road;
      (2)   The residential lot is on a hard surfaced, but not necessarily
curbed, road;
      (3)   The residential lot is on an unpaved road when it is determined
that the entire area is rural in nature and that paving should not be
installed;
      (4)   The residential lot is on an approved public street; or
      (5)   When it would be impractical to require paving because the property
is abutting a street included within an approved street bond program or where
such paving can be best accomplished through an assessment district.
   (F)   Sanitary sewer. The city shall require the extension and installation
of sanitary sewer lines to serve all subdivided property if such property is,
as determined by applying current professional standards of planning and civil
engineering, reasonably accessible to a sanitary sewer main. If a subdivided
tract is not reasonably accessible to sanitary sewer, this requirement may be
waived and a septic system utilized under the following conditions:
      (1)   Percolation test results approved by the state’s Department of
Environmental Quality;
      (2)   The septic system is proposed for soil which is not classified by
the Soil Conservation Service as severe for septic tank filter fields. This may
be waived if satisfactory information is provided to the Planning Commission
Chairperson indicating the inclusion of adequate soils on the property for
septic tank filter fields;
      (3)   The septic system shall be installed and inspected as required by
the state’s Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ); and
      (4)   Minimum lot sizes shall meet the requirements of the city’s zoning
ordinance and the state’s Administrative Code § 252:641, App. A.
   (G)   Water. The city shall require extension and installation of water
mains consistent with the city’s utility extension policies, to serve all
subdivided property if such property is determined by applying current
professional standards of planning and civil engineering to be reasonably
accessible to an existing water main. If the subdivided tract is not reasonably
accessible to an existing water main, this requirement may be waived and a
private water well utilized under the following conditions:
      (1)   Proper approval of water well drilling by the state’s Water
Resources Board and the state’s Department of Environmental Quality is
obtained; and
      (2)   Locational criteria, if water well and septic tank are both used,
are met.
   (H)   Force of approval. Once the initial deed or any subsequent deed has
been approved by the Planning Commission, such approval relates back to the
original lot split and covers all future conveyances using the same legal
description. However, no more than three deed approvals or lot splits shall be
approved based on the initial deed or any subsequent deed unless such property
has been duly conveyed to another person.
   (I)   Platting required. Platting or replatting may be required by the
Planning Commission under the following conditions:
      (1)   A previously platted lot, parcel or tract is being subdivided into
more than three lots or more than six lots when an existing lot, parcel or
tract is Zone A, Agriculture District, and is abutting a section line road.
      (2)   The design of a subdivision is significantly altered by the
creation or deletion of lots;
      (3)   The dedication or abandonment/vacation of any street or any public
utility easement is involved;
      (4)   The creation of a statutory private road subdivision is involved,
and the lots are two acres or less in size; or
      (5)   Property is to be re-zoned.

§ 153.008 VACATION OF PLATS.
   (A)   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated, following court action, as required by state law.
   (B)   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Planning Commission in
like manner as plats of subdivisions. The City Council may reject any such
instrument which abridges or destroy any public rights in any of its public
uses, improvements, streets or alleys.
   (C)   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded or filed, in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and, being duly
recorded or filed, shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alleys, public grounds and dedications laid out or described in such
plat.
   (D)   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein
provided, by all of the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution of
such writing, subsequent to court action as required by applicable state law.

by the Planning Commission, due notice of which shall be given as required by
municipal ordinance.

§ 153.013 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purpose of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that,
such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations; and, further provided that, the Planning Commission shall
not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area where the
variance is located;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result (as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience), if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out; and
      (4)   The variances will not in any manner conflict with or vary from,
the provisions of
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances or Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   In approving variances, the Planning Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.

stating the time, date, place of hearing on the property owners’ organization’s
failure to perform required acts and such additional information as may be
desired; or
         (b)   Two posted sign notices on three-foot by four-foot signs set at
each entrance to the subdivision stating a hearing shall be held before the
Newcastle Planning and Zoning Commission on the failure of the property owners’
organization to properly perform its required acts.
      (2)   Meeting time/date and meeting place of the notice of hearing shall
be served or posted at least 14 days before the hearing date.
         (a)   The meeting shall be conducted in an open meeting of the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear
statements of city staff concerning the property owners’ organization’s failure
to perform and statements of the officers of the property owners’ organization
and as such other statements as the Planning and Zoning Commission desire. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall at the hearing determine the character of
the deficiencies in the performance of the required acts, set an appropriate
period for the property owners’ organization to cure the deficiencies, and set
a review hearing date. If the deficiencies are not cured within the time set,
the city may, but is not required to, enter upon such subdivision properties
and perform the required acts for a period of one year in order to preserve the
taxable values of properties within the development, to prevent the development
or continuation of a public nuisance, or to protect the public health and
welfare. Such entry, performance and maintenance shall not vest in the public
any right to use the common facilities not dedicated to public use.
         (b)   At least 30 days before the expiration of the one-year
authorized city entry performance period, the city’s Planning and Zoning
Commission shall upon its own initiative or upon written request of the
property owners’ organization whose responsibilities are being performed by the
city, call a public hearing on the continuance of the city performance of the
property owners’ organization’s responsibilities and give notice of a hearing
in the same manner as set out above for the initial hearing. At the hearing the
city staff and the property owners’ organization and/or residents of the
subdivision may present statements and demonstrate why or why not the
performance of the property owners’ organization’s responsibilities by the city
should cease and such performance be assumed by the property owners’
organization.
      (3)   If the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that it is not
necessary for the city to continue performance of the property owners’
organization’s responsibilities, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall, at
the hearing, in consultation with city staff, the property owners’ organization
and/or residents of the subdivision, determine the time and conditions under
which the city performance will cease and the property owners’ organization’s
performance will commence.
      (4)   If the Planning and Zoning Commission determines it is necessary
that the city continue to perform the responsibilities of the property owners’
organization, the city shall continue such performance for the next year
subject to a similar hearing and determination at the end of each succeeding
year.
       (5)   The cost of performance by the city shall be a lien upon the
common facilities of the subdivision and the private properties within the
subdivision. The city’s Planning and Zoning Commission in consultation with
city staff shall have the right to make additional assessments against the
properties in the subdivision to cover the cost of the city’s performance. Any
unpaid assessment shall be a lien against the common facilities of the
subdivision enforceable the same as a mortgage against such property. The city
may further foreclosure its lien on the properties by certifying the same to
the County Treasurer for collection as in the case of collection of general
property taxes.
      (6)   Should the performance of property owners’ organization’s
responsibilities continue for a period of more than three years, the
circumstances thereof shall be presented to the City Council by the Planning
and Zoning Commission on their regular agenda or at a special meeting called
for that purpose, with notice provided to the property owners’ organization in
the same manner as for the initial and annual hearings before the Planning and
Zoning Commission, and the City Council may determine:
         (a)   To cease city performance of the property owners’ organization’s
responsibilities;
         (b)   To continue city performance of the property owners’
organization’s responsibilities; and
         (c)   The city should assume permanent responsibility for performance
of part or all of the property owners’ organization’s responsibilities subject
to all properties being brought to current city standards prior to the city
assuming such responsibilities and the determination of the appropriate cost
assessment against the common facilities and private property in the
subdivision to pay all cost to bring such facilities to city standards and
determine special assessment or financing mechanisms to facilitate the payment
of the costs.

industrial and public uses shall be designed to provide adequate light, air,
open space, landscaping and off-street parking and loading facilities.
   (C)   The arrangement of lots, blocks and the street system should be
designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical
features. Tree masses or large individual trees should be preserved. The system
of sidewalks, roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take advantage
of the visual qualities of the area.
(2002 Code, § 153.045) (Ord. 230, passed 9-8-1986; Ord. 415, passed 12-14-1998;
Ord. 651, passed 10-26-2009)
§ 153.046 STREETS: GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The developer of any subdivision designed to be used for residential,
commercial or other purpose shall lay out, grade and otherwise improve all
streets that are designated on the approved plat or that directly serve the
subdivision in accordance with the standards and specifications of these
regulations and other applicable regulations. The construction standards in
these regulations provide an appropriate range of basic and optional
requirements for street improvements.
   (B)   Streets shall conform in design and layout to the standards and
principles contained herein.
   (C)   Every lot within a subdivision shall have access to a street.
   (D)   No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided
shall have frontage on, and access from, an existing street, unless such street
is:
      (1)   An existing state or county highway; or
      (2)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Planning Commission and
recorded in the County Clerk’s office. Such street or highway must be suitably
improved as required by highway regulations and/or street specifications, or be
secured by a performance bond required under these regulations, with the width
and right-of-way required by these regulations.
   (E)   Whenever a subdivision contains a street that requires a street
facility that is more costly than is required to serve the future occupants of
the subdivision, the subdivider shall be require to pay only the portion of the
cost of the street that would equal the improvement required to serve only the
subdivision, as determined by the Planning Commission and the City Council.
   (F)   Residential development adjacent to a section line street or other
arterial street shall comply with the following.
      (1)   Only backing or siding residential lots shall be used adjacent to
the above described roadways unless a frontage road is provided for local
access purposes. This shall not apply to any residential lots two acres or more
in size.
      (2)   Steel mesh fencing at least four feet high with permanent evergreen
plant screening, at least three feet high, or a fence approved by the city,
shall be installed by the developer within the required screening easement at
the right-of-way line behind or at the side of residential lots and shall be
maintained by the developer for one year from the date of installation. There
shall be no openings in any fence for vehicular access onto the above described
roadways, except at street intersections, and at approved openings to
commercial areas.
      (3)   Subdivision streets shall not open onto an arterial street except
at an average interval of not less than one-eighth mile, measured from the
centerlines.
      (4)   The maintenance of all required fencing and the arterial right-of-
way, including mowing, must be addressed by the developer. Maintenance shall be
provided by a mandatory property owners’ association. Such provisions cannot be
changed without the express written approval of the city.
   (G)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall conform to all elements of the Comprehensive Plan and be designed
in accordance with the provisions of these regulations and other applicable
regulations.
   (H)   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local roads
shall be curved wherever possible to provide topographic compatibility. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and curves shall be avoided.
   (I)   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators (such as industries, schools, churches and the like), to population
densities and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
   (J)   In business, industrial or other similar developments, the streets and
other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
   (K)   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned
or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of the proposed
future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and
submitted by the subdivider.
   (L)   No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of
the Planning Commission and the City Council. The developer shall obtain
approval from the 911 Coordinator on street names prior to filing the
application.
   (M)   Major streets in the subdivision shall be planned to conform with the
Major Street Plan adopted by the city and provision shall be made for the
extension of major and secondary thoroughfares. Except for courts, places or
cul-de-sacs, streets normally shall connect with streets already dedicated in
adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, provide for future connections to adjoining
unsubdivided tracts or be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest
subdivided tracts, or conform to a neighborhood plan approved and adopted by
the Planning Commission.
   (N)   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the Planning Commission may require service streets, reverse frontage
with screen planting contained in a non- access reservation along the rear
property line, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
through and local traffic.
   (O)   Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged.
   (P)   Railroad rights-of-way and limited-access highways, where so located
as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
      (1)   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth
in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited-access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
“This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is
prohibited.”
      (2)   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
   (Q)   Reserve strips controlling access to minor streets by parties or
persons other than public agencies shall be prohibited.
   (R)   (1)   Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations; and, provided that, the Planning Commission
finds it will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half of the
street easement when the adjoining property is subdivided.
      (2)   Whenever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the
other half of the street shall be platted within the tract which is being
subdivided.
   (S)   (1)   Whenever the major or minor street is located wholly within the
proposed subdivision, the total width of the right-of-way shall be dedicated.
      (2)   Whenever the major or minor street is located adjacent to the outer
edge of the subdivision, one-half of the right-of-way shall be dedicated, if it
is determined by the Planning Commission that it is equitable and feasible from
an engineering design standpoint for the other half of the right-of-way to be
dedicated from adjacent property.
   (T)   COLLECTOR STREET is defined as a street that collects traffic from
minor streets en route to major streets or community facilities and it serves
more than 40 dwelling units.

circumstances or topography dictates.
   (B)   In the case of temporary dead-end streets which are incomplete but
designed to provide future connection with adjoining unsubdivided areas, proper
provisions shall be made for adequate storm drainage so that storm water does
not collect at the ends of these streets. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-
way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary turnabout shall be
provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the
subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert
to abuttors whenever the street is continued. The Planning Commission may limit

indicated on the plat.
   (D)   The applicant shall establish, as a common area for maintenance by a
property owners’ association, land on both sides of existing water courses, to
a distance to be determined by the Planning Commission; provided, the applicant
shall be required to dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or conservation
easement in the event the city deems that public dedication of drainage areas
is more desirable.
   (E)    (1)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as
drainageways.
      (2)   Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be
computed in determining the number of lots to be utilized for average density
procedure not for computing the area requirement of any lot.
   (F)   Modifications to open drainage channels.

         (b)   Application for modification. Property owners wishing to enclose
or modify a drainage channel must submit an application to the city. The
application shall include:
            1.   A detailed site plan depicting the proposed modifications;
            2.   A hydrologic and hydraulic study, using current city
requirements or higher standards, demonstrating that the proposed changes will
not result in any increase in flow rates, flood levels, or adverse impacts to
adjacent properties or public infrastructure; and
            3.   Any additional documentation deemed necessary by the city.
         (c)   Review and approval.
            1.   The City Engineer or a designee shall review the application
and may request modifications, additional studies, or supporting documentation
as necessary.
            2.   Approval shall only be granted if a determination is made that
the proposed modification will not alter the overall drainage system’s function
or capacity, is compliant with current city requirements, and the proposed
modification will not have an adverse impact to upstream or downstream
properties or infrastructure.
      (3)   Enforcement and penalties. Any property owner who modifies an open
drainage channel without approval as required by this section shall be subject
to penalties as provided in the Newcastle City Code. This may include

   (A)   Lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing
building permits to build on all lots in compliance with
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances and health regulations, and in providing
driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved street. Where
possible, driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring
vehicles to back into traffic on major or secondary arterials.
   (B)   Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances. Where lots are more than double the minimum
required area for the zoning district, the Planning Commission may require that
such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of
future streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all
in compliance with
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances and these regulations.
   (C)   In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines
(or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give
a better
street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow
for erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both
streets.
   (D)   The depth of residential lots, other than lots for townhouses, should
not be less than 100 feet.
   (E)   The area of residential lots, other than lots for townhouses, shall
not be less than 7,200 square feet.
   (F)   The minimum lot frontage shall be as required by
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances.
   (G)   In subdivisions where septic tanks or other individual sewage disposal
devices are to be installed, the size of all lots included in such subdivision
shall be as required by
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances and subject to the approval of the state’s
Department of Environmental Quality or other appropriate state agency. The
appropriate agency shall notify the developer and the Planning Commission in
writing of its findings.
   (H)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except
where they are needed to provide for the separation of residential development
from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
   (I)   Lots shall not be required for subdivisions for commercial and
industrial use, but when provided should be of appropriate size and arrangement
to provide for adequate off-street parking and loading facilities based on the
intended use. No individual parcel shall be created for a particular commercial
or industrial use that has an area, width or depth that is less than is
required for the permitted use under the applicable provisions of
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances.

oil or gas well which is not adequately plugged according to the standards
established by state law and the state’s Corporation Commission (and so
certified by that Corporation Commission) and which is outside of the
boundaries of a proposed subdivision but within 150 feet thereof, there shall
be a building setback line placed on the plat so as to prevent the erection of
any building within 150 feet of such wells. Where there is found to be an
abandoned oil or gas well which is adequately plugged according to the
standards established by state law and the state’s Corporation Commission,
which well is within the boundaries of a proposed subdivision, certificate or
clearance from the state’s Corporation Commission shall be obtained for each
such well before the final plat of the subdivision is approved.

§ 153.058 PUBLIC AREAS.
   (A)   Except when an applicant utilizes a form of planned development,
whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a school, recreation uses (in excess
of the requirements of §
153.059 of this chapter), or other public use as indicated on the Comprehensive
Plan or any portion thereof, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the
applicant into his sketch. After proper determination of its necessity by the
Planning Commission and the appropriate local government official or other
public agency involved in the acquisition and use of each such site and, after
a determination has been made to acquire the site by the public agency, the
site shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant into the preliminary and
final plats.
   (B)   Staff shall refer the sketch to the public body concerned with
acquisition for its consideration and report. The staff or Planning Commission
may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public
body or agency 40 days for reply. The agency’s recommendation, if affirmative,
shall include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be
acquired and an estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition.
   (C)   Upon receipt of an affirmative report, staff shall notify the property
owner and designate on the preliminary and final plats that area proposed to be
acquired by the public body.
   (D)   The acquisition of land reserved by a public agency on the final plat
shall be initiated within 12 months of notification, in writing, from the owner
that he or she intends to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be
accompanied by a sketch of the proposed development and a tentative schedule of
construction. Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate acquisition
within the prescribed 12 months shall result in the removal of the “reserved”
designation from the property involved and the freeing of the property for
development in accordance with these regulations.

§ 153.059 PARKS, OPEN SPACES AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   (A)   Where a subdivision contains more than ten acres, the subdivision
shall provide for the dedication of not less than 3.5% of the total land area
to the homeowners’ association for use as parks or open spaces and natural
features; such land shall be maintained by the homeowners’ association in
accordance with its creating documents and allow for public access. A fee in
lieu of parkland dedication will be assessed at $400 per lot with payment due
upon acceptance of the final plat. Fees may be utilized for any type of public
park or space improvement, public park or space maintenance including
maintenance equipment, purchase of land for the purpose of expanding a public
park or space, creating a new public park or space, or any other public park or
space related item not delineated by this section. Fees collected shall be
receipted into the Public Parks and Spaces Fund (PPSF) established by City
Council. Agriculture zoned land is excluded from the provisions of this
section. The following guidelines will be applied in the approval process for
parks, or open spaces and natural features:
      (1)   Access. Parks or open spaces shall be placed to be within easy and
safe walking distance of all dwelling units.
      (2)   Topography. The land to be dedicated to meet the requirements of
this section shall be suitable for parks, open spaces, and recreational
activities.
      (3)   Unity. The dedicated land should form a single parcel or tract of
land wherever possible.
      (4)   Shape. The shape of the parcel or tract of land to be dedicated
should be appropriate for parks and recreation purposes (i.e., softball,
tennis, and usable open space).
      (5)   Location. The land to be dedicated shall be located to serve the
recreation and open space needs of the subdivision for which the dedication was
made. However, an evaluation of possible locations would also include factors
such as freedom from possible safety hazards (i.e., major thoroughfares).
      (6)   Parkland must be improved prior to dedication to HOA; improved
parkland includes but is not limited to: playground equipment; trails;
amenities such as park benches and trash receptacles; landscape improvements
and tree plantings; pergolas, pavilions, and gazebos; water features; sports
fields; picnic benches; lighting; and the like.
   (B)   Existing features which would add value to residential development to
the city, as a whole, such as trees (as herein defined), watercourses and
falls, landmarks, historic sites and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved in the design of the subdivision, whenever possible. No trees shall
be removed from any subdivision, nor any change of grade of the land affected
until approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on the plat
required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees where required shall
be welled and protected against change of grade. The preliminary plat shall
show the number and location of existing trees and shall further indicate all
those marked for retention, and the location of all proposed shade trees along
the street side of each lot.

§ 153.060 NON-RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for commercial
or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect to such land
shall make such provisions as the Planning Commission may require.
   (B)   A non-residential subdivision shall also be subject to all the
requirements of site plan approval set forth in
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances. Site plan approval and non-residential
subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the
Planning Commission. A non-residential subdivision shall be subject to all the
requirements of these regulations, as well as such additional standards
required by the Planning Commission, and shall conform to the proposed land use
and standards established in the Comprehensive Plan and
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances.
   (C)   In addition to the principles and standards in these regulations, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that
the street parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the
uses anticipated, and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The
following principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed with respect to street, curb,
gutter and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and storm water
drainage.
      (5)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from the potential nuisance of a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels
backing up on existing or potential residential development and provisions for
a permanently landscaped buffer strip when necessary; and
      (6)   Streets carrying non-residential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.

§ 153.061 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   Whenever a subdivision is developed as a planned unit development under the
appropriate provisions of
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances, wherein adequate park or recreation area is
provided, through traffic is cared for adequately and the majority of the minor
streets are of the cul-de-sac or loop type, the Planning Commission may vary
the design requirements of these regulations, in order to allow the subdivider
more freedom in the arrangement of streets and lots, but at the same time
protect the convenience, health, safety and welfare of the entire community.
However, in no case shall the overall density, intensity of use or land area
coverage for the planned unit development exceed those minimums established in
Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances.

required by this chapter or the Newcastle City Council shall be assured by one
of the following methods:
      (1)   Prior to the recording of a final plat in the office of the County
Clerk the subdivider/applicant shall complete, in accordance with the approved
construction plans, all improvements required in this chapter as specified in
the final plat and/or planned unit development master plan and master
development plan map, and, when required, shall dedicate the improvements to
the city in accordance with this chapter. The final plat will not be released
for recording with the County Clerk until after satisfactory completion and
acceptance of the required improvements.
      (2)   In lieu of completion of all improvements prior to final plat
approval and recording, the city may, at its discretion, enter into an
agreement with the subdivider/applicant whereby the subdivider/applicant shall
guarantee to complete all improvements as may be specified by the Planning
Commission and approved by the City Council. To secure this agreement, the
subdivider/applicant shall provide, subject to the approval of the City
Council, one of the following guarantees:
         (a)   Subdivision bonds, performance bonds, or improvement bonds. The
subdivider/applicant shall file with the City Clerk a subdivision bond, issued
by an institution licensed to do business in the State of Oklahoma as a surety
company, together with supporting detailed construction contracts in the amount
of 110% of the estimated construction costs of the required improvements. In
the alternative, the subdivider/applicant shall file with the City Clerk
performance bonds, or improvement bonds, for each of the required improvements.
A professional engineer shall furnish detailed estimates of the costs of all
required improvements and utilities to the City Engineer, who shall review the
estimates in order to determine the adequacy of the bond or bonds for ensuring
the construction of the required improvements and facilities. Generally,
performance bonds or improvement bonds will be required for paving, drainage,
storm sewer, water and sewer improvements, boring, and construction of any
required facilities including but not limited to lift stations, indicated by
the improvement plans and final plat or to serve the final plat property.
Release of subdivision bonds, performance bonds or improvement bonds may be
made upon the following conditions:
            1.   All dedications, easements and improvements relative to the
final plat and to the surety bond or bonds shall be brought before the City
Council for acceptance. Upon such acceptance, the applicant shall file the

after acceptance of all improvements, certified as complete by the Planning
Department Director and accepted by the City Council;
            2.   A copy of the as-built plans, prepared by a professional
engineer showing the location of all improvements, shall be submitted to the
Newcastle Planning Department prior to release of the bonds securing the same;
and
            3.   Maintenance bonds as required in this section have been filed
with the City Clerk and approved by the City Engineer.
         (b)   Escrow account. The subdivider/applicant shall deposit cash, or
other instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, either with the
city as approved by the Newcastle City Manager or in escrow with a bank or
savings and loan institution. The use of any instrument other than cash shall
be subject to approval by the City Council. The amount of the deposit shall be
110% of the full amount of the cost of the required improvements, as estimated
by a professional engineer hired by the subdivider/applicant and approved by
the City Engineer. In the case of an escrow account, the subdivider/applicant
shall file with the City Clerk, for approval by the Newcastle City Attorney, an
agreement between the financial institution and the subdivider/applicant
guaranteeing the following:
            1.   That the funds of the escrow account shall be held in trust
until released by the City Council and may not be used or pledged by the
subdivider/applicant as security in any other matter during that period; and
            2.   That in the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider/
applicant to complete the improvements, the financial institution shall
immediately make the funds in the account available to the city for use in the
completion of those improvements.
         (c)   Letter of credit. Subject to the approval of the City Council,
the subdivider/applicant shall provide a letter of credit from a bank or other
reputable institution or individual. This letter of credit shall be submitted
to the City Clerk for approval by the City Attorney and recommendation for
acceptance by the City Council. The letter of credit shall certify the
following:
            1.   That the creditor does guarantee funds equivalent to 110% of
the full amount as estimated with details by a professional engineer and
approved by the City Engineer;
            2.   That, in the case of failure on the part of the subdivider/
applicant to complete the specified improvements within the required time
period, the creditor shall pay to the city immediately and without further
action such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of the
improvements, up to the limit of credit stated in the letter of credit; and
            3.   That the letter of credit may not be withdrawn, or reduced in
amount, until approved by the City Council according to the provisions of this
section.
   (C)   Time limit for completion of improvements.
      (1)   The period within which required improvements must be completed
shall be specified by the City Council in approving the final plat and shall be
incorporated in the bond or other instrument, and shall not in any event exceed
two years from the date of final approval of the plat or acceptance of the
surety bond or other method of assurance, whichever is later. In the event a
surety bond or other method of assurance is submitted for acceptance more than
one year from the date of final plat approval, a revised current engineer's
detailed estimate of costs shall be required.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may, upon application of the subdivider/
applicant and upon proof of hardship, recommend to the City Council extension
of the completion date set forth in such bonds or other instrument for a
maximum period of one additional year. Such extension shall be granted no more
than two times. Each application for extension shall be accompanied by an
updated detailed estimate of construction costs prepared by a professional
engineer. Surety bonds or other assurances for completion must be filed in the
amount of 110% of the updated estimate of construction costs as approved by the
City Engineer.
   (D)   Maintenance bonds required.
      (1)   Responsibility for maintenance. The contractor shall be required to
maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots, streets and common
areas until acceptance of the improvements by the City Council, after which
time claims for failure of improvements may be made on required maintenance
bonds, unless otherwise agreed upon by the city and the subdivider/applicant
and repairs are made.
      (2)   Maintenance bonds. Prior to dedication and acceptance by the City
Council of all public improvements, maintenance bonds in favor of the City of
Newcastle shall be posted and submitted to the City Clerk with supporting
construction contracts and detailed cost estimates for review by the City
Engineer. Maintenance bonds shall be filed in the following amounts and for the
following terms:
         (a)   Paving improvements:
            1.   One hundred percent for one year from the date of acceptance
of improvements;
            2.   Fifty percent for the second year;

   (E)   Combination bonds. Nothing herein shall prevent submittal of
combination subdivision surety bonds containing provisions for maintenance from
the subdivider/applicant or developer. Such bonds shall fully comply with the
requirements of this chapter and shall be subject to approval as if submitted
separately.
   (F)   Subdivision improvements and infrastructure inspections. The City
Engineer, Streets Superintendent, Public Works Superintendent, Planning staff
or other qualified designee of the Planning and Community Development Director,
shall inspect for compliance in the construction of all infrastructure.
      (1)   Once a developer has completed all infrastructure improvements,
prior to acceptance of improvements by the City Council, an improvement
inspection must be completed. Infrastructure improvements, including water,
sewer, paving and storm drainage, shall be inspected by designated city staff
for compliance with approved infrastructure construction plans for a final plat
that was approved by City Council.
      (2)   Upon completion of the improvement inspections the Public Works and
Streets Superintendents and City Engineer or designee shall submit a letter of
acceptance for the public improvements to the City Council, that the
improvements have been completed in accordance with the plans as approved by
the City Council. Inspection fees for the improvement inspections of all water,
sewer, paving, storm drainage, and the like shall be paid to the city prior to
any infrastructure improvement inspection.
      (3)   Inspection fees shall be 1% of the total cost of public
improvements combined; water, sewer, paving and storm drainage. The 1%
inspection fee will be calculated and based on the cost of construction
contracts and detailed cost estimates of the improvements. This fee shall be
paid to the city once the final plat is approved by City Council.

      BRIDGE. Constructed with abutments and superstructures, which are
typically concrete, steel or other material. Since the superstructures are
generally not an integral structural part of the abutments, and are therefore
free to move, the hydraulic criteria for bridges is different than for
culverts. BRIDGES are also usually constructed with earth or rock inverts,
whereas culverts are typically the same material throughout the waterway
opening.
      CULVERT. A closed conduit for the passage of water under an embankment,
such as a road, railroad, or delivery. The distinction between a CULVERT and a
sewer is the means by which flow enters the conduit. Flow normally enters a
CULVERT by an open channel, generally at a similar elevation and a culvert
usually crosses a street.
   (C)   Culverts.
      (1)   Construction materials. Culverts shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete or corrugated metal.
      (2)   Sizing method. Culvert design shall be in accordance with §
153.089 of this chapter.
      (3)   Design frequency. Minimum design frequency for culverts shall be
100-year.
      (4)   Minimum size.
         (a)   Pipe culverts: 18-inch equivalent; and
         (b)   Box culverts: no less than three feet in height.
      (5)   Velocity limitations.
         (a)   In design of culverts both the minimum and maximum velocities
must be considered. A minimum velocity of three feet per second at the outlet
is required to assure a self-cleaning condition of the culvert.
         (b)   The outlet area shall include a headwall with wing walls or end-
section in addition to the riprap protection if required. Where outlet
velocities exceed six feet per second, erosion control measures shall be taken.
Energy dissipaters shall be provided as required.
      (6)   Structural design. Culverts shall be design to withstand an HS-20
loading in accordance with the design procedures of AASHTO Standards
Specifications for Highway Bridges and with pipe manufactures recommendations.
In addition, the AASHTO maximum heights of cover for corrugated metal
structures shall be followed. The minimum cover over the top of the pipe shall
be 12 inches.
      (7)   Driveway crossings. Driveway culverts shall be sized to pass the
100-year ditch flow capacity without overtopping the driveway. The minimum size
culvert shall be 18-inch pipe, or equivalent, where required, for all streets.
Slopewalls shall be required per the standard detail drawings (see
App. A to this chapter).
      (8)   Concrete end treatments. All culvert inlets and outlets shall have
standard ODOT concrete end treatments.
   (D)   Bridges.
      (1)   Bridge sizing criteria. The sizing criteria set forth in division
(C) above for culverts shall apply as follows.
         (a)   FREEBOARD is defined as the vertical clearance of the lowest
structural member of the bridge superstructure above the water surface
elevation of the design frequency flood. The minimum FREEBOARD shall be one
foot for 100-year frequency flood.
         (b)   BACKWATER is defined as the rise in the flood water surface due
to the restrictions created by the construction of the bridge. The maximum
BACKWATER shall be one foot.
      (2)   Velocity limitations. The velocity limitations through the bridge
opening are controlled by the potential abutment scour and subsequent erosion
protection provided. Using riprap for the channel lining and/or protection of
the abutments and wing walls, the maximum channel velocity is limited to 15
fps.
      (3)   Hydraulic analysis. The hydraulic design of bridge crossing shall
be in accordance with the state’s Department of Transportation Drainage Design
Manual, 1988.
      (4)   Inlet and outlet configuration.
         (a)   The bridge design shall include adequate wing walls of
sufficient length to prevent abutment erosion and provide slope stabilization
from the embankment to the channel.
         (b)   Erosion protection on the inlet and outlet transition slopes
shall be protected from the erosive forces of eddy current.
      (5)   Criteria; compliance. Bridges shall be designed in accordance with
AASHTO/ODOT criteria. Rails shall comply with ODOT standard details.

§ 153.089 STORM DRAINAGE AND FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Drainage facilities shall be designed to provide a sufficient storm
water drainage system for the conveyance of storm water runoff received from
upstream and from the subject property with due allowance having been made for
continued conveyance of storm water runoff from adjacent properties as the
drainage basin develops.
      (2)   The drainage system including streets, bridges, culverts, open
channels, detention/retention facilities and the like, shall be designed to
carry all probable storm recurrence intervals up to and including the 100-year
storm event.
      (3)   A dedicated drainage easement shall encompass all land lying below
the water surface elevation generated by the 100-year storm event and resulting
storm water runoff. These dedicated drainage easements shall be platted as
common area in all developments.
      (4)   Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building pads
to an elevation where the lowest finished floor elevations shall be a minimum
of one foot above the 100-year storm event. In all developments, surface water
from each dwelling lot will flow away from each dwelling in a controlled manner
to an approved collection or disposal location.
      (5)   Improvements shall be designed such that there is no increase in
flow leaving the site or in the depth of flooding downstream.
      (6)   Existing structures within and adjoining a proposed development
shall be evaluated in terms of hydraulic capacity and structural soundness.
Those structures found to be structurally inadequate shall be modified or
completely removed and replaced by the developer. Structures found to be
hydraulically inadequate for flow and/or for protecting property as a result of
the changing runoff characteristics shall be replaced or modified by the
developer to provide the required capacity and/or protection.
      (7)   All utilities located within the floodplain or any other open
channel or swale shall be designed to prevent infiltration of flood water and
to protect against washouts. Location of the utilities shall not restrict flood
flows.

      (10)   Official floodplain designations and delineations of the
floodplains and floodways denoting limits of permissible developments shall be
shown on all preliminary plans and final plats submitted for approval wherever
such plans and plats contain a floodplain segment. In any case in which
official floodplains are not delineated, they shall be determined on the basis
of these standards and shall be shown on all preliminary plans and final plats
submitted for approval.
      (11)   The limits of the floodplains shown on regulatory floodplain maps
are close approximations based on extrapolations made between widely-spaced
cross sections. Therefore, the actual limits of the floodplain shall be
determined by extracting base flood elevations from the stream profile and
determining where each elevation intersects the adjacent existing topography.
If a conflict exists between the overlay of the regulatory floodplain map and
the existing topography, a submittal of a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) by the developer/owner to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) is required when the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) conflicts with proposed lots or other proposed structures or
improvements.
      (12)   Computations and plans to support all drainage designs shall be
submitted to the City Engineer for review. The computations and plans shall be
in such form as to provide the basis for timely and consistent review and will
be made a part of the permanent record for future evaluation. The computations
and plans shall be accompanied by the certification of a registered
professional engineer licensed to practice in the state. Before final
acceptance, the submitting engineer shall provide an as-built plan based on
field survey data of the streets, storm sewer, detention facilities, and all
other conveyances of storm water; a revised set of drainage calculations that
correspond with the as-built plans; and a letter of certification stating that
the as-built site complies with all governing ordinances of the city.

system that outlets to a manmade or natural drainage path and be constructed in
such a manner as to prevent the flow of water from causing a negative impact to
other properties. The foundation drain material shall be corrugated
polyethylene pipe with a smooth interior or approved equal.
            2.   Include a minimum of 12 inch wide stone backfill drainage
system from the top of the footing to six inches below the top of wall,
allowing surface stormwater to drain to the foundation drain and reduce
overtopping. Separation from the stone backfill and earth backfill shall
include nonwoven geotextile fabric in accordance with Oklahoma Department of
Transportation 2019 standard specifications for highway construction;
geotextiles for subsurface drainage purposes.
            3.   Alternate drainage methods shall be allowed, as approved by
the City Engineer.
         (d)   Walls greater than four feet in height measured from the top of
the foundation (footing) to the top of the wall shall include a design
submittal sealed by a qualified licensed professional engineer.
   (B)   Drainage report. For all areas not otherwise designated in a floodway
or floodway-fringe area, the developer shall be responsible for having an
engineer (registered in the state) prepare a drainage report for the area of
the proposed subdivision, and all areas affected by runoff resulting from
development of the proposed subdivision. The drainage report shall show
compliance with this section and shall clearly indicate the existing and
proposed runoff from the subdivision and state whether or not peak release
rates comply with these regulations.
   (C)   Determination of storm runoff.
      (1)   General. Numerous methods of runoff computation are available on
which the design of storm drainage and flood control systems may be based. The
rational method will be accepted as adequate for drainage areas up to 40 acres.

   Rainfall Intensity Formula
   I = a/(td + b)c
      Where   I    =   Average rainfall, intensity, inches/hour
      Td   =   Rainfall duration (or time of concentration), minutes
         a, b, c   =   Variable values from the following table:

b = 11.5  b = 15   b = 15   b = 15   b = 15   b = 15
c = 0.810 c = 0.80 c = 0.80 c = 0.80 c = 0.80 c = 0.80
 
The time of concentration is the time required for the entire watershed to
contribute runoff to the point of interest. Street flow shall be considered as
being in an open paved channel.

Concrete lined channel 0.006
Curbed street          0.0035

been made shall be submitted.
      (14)   A drainage easement of satisfactory width to provide working room
for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all storm sewers with
the minimum width of the easement being 15 feet. The presence of any bedding
materials, backfill and the depth of pipe also shall be taken into

points with sufficient inlet design to ensure the ponding depth does not exceed
five inches in a 100-year storm event for a standard six inches barrier curbed
or standard six inches mountable curbed street. For non-arterial streets with
non-standard curbs, the maximum 100-year storm event water surface elevation in

freeboard between the water surface elevation and the top of the curb that is
required in the first part of this section. For arterial or section line
streets, ponding depth shall not exceed four inches in a 100-year storm event.
         (g)   All storm sewer systems located at a low point (sump) shall
provide for an emergency overflow channel with a designated drainage easement
sufficiently sized to contain within its boundaries the 100-year storm event
runoff under the assumed conditions that the sump position storm sewer inlets/
grates are 100% blocked, and in addition provide sufficient working room for
future maintenance.
         (h)   Any inlet grates over which a bicyclist can ride shall be of a
design considered bicycle safe.
   (F)   Open channels.
      (1)   All land adjoining open natural or improved storm drainage channels
having an elevation below the 100-year flood elevation of the channel shall be
dedicated drainage easement for the purpose of providing a zone of protection
to all property owners. To facilitate future maintenance, the entire width of
the channel and channel banks shall be covered by the same drainage easement.
Such channels in developments shall be platted as common area and have a
maintenance program carried out by the property owners’ association.
      (2)   All drainage easements platted for the purpose of conveying storm

Prohibited obstructions and encroachments shall include, but are not limited
to, fences that block or inhibit the flow of water such as those made of brick
or wood panels, swimming pools, driveways, mechanical and electrical equipment,
storage sheds and retaining walls.
      (3)   Any channel improvements shall be approved by the city prior to the
commencement of any work thereon. Where safety issues are identified,
additional requirements may be imposed for mitigation by the Planning
Commission.
      (4)   Whenever channel improvements are carried out, sodding,
backsloping, cribbing and other bank protection shall be designed and
constructed to control siltation and erosion for the anticipated conditions and
flow resulting from a 100-year frequency rainfall.
      (5)   Drainage easements sufficient in width to provide a buffer and
provide working room for construction and access for channel maintenance shall
be provided.
      (6)   For an unimproved channel, the width of the drainage easement shall
be wide enough to satisfy division (F)(5) above as well as to provide enough
area to flatten the slope of the bank of the channel 4:1 (horizontally:
vertically) to allow for the remediation of any future bank erosion.
      (7)   All drainage swales, channels, berms and other drainage
improvements shown on the approved plans shall be constructed prior to the
acceptance of the final plat.
      (8)   Channels should be trapezoidal in shape and on as flat a grade as
possible without causing ponding.
      (9)   The use of Manning’s Equation in the calculations of hydraulic
characteristics of open channel flows in prismatic channels without backwater
control will be acceptable. When analyzing natural channels or when analyzing
any overland conveyance system that has downstream control that could affect
the 100-year event water surface elevations, the use of the HEC-RAS (U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System)
modeling program or other approved water surface profile modeling program shall
be required. The “n” value(s) used for channel shall be based on the individual
channel characteristics. When submitting calculations, include the source for
the “n” value.
      (10)   The minimum bottom width shall be two feet with side slopes not

sewer systems and in lieu of enclosed pipe to drain areas not exceeding two
acres in size. All concrete flumes shall extend to the rear of adjacent lots,
have scour protection at their point of discharge and shall discharge into a
dedicated drainage area or channel without creating drainage or erosion
problems.
      (14)   Concrete flumes that serve as overflow protection at a sump-
position storm sewer system shall be designed for the 100-year storm event flow
under the conditions that all upstream inlets and grates are experiencing 50%
clogging and the sump position inlets/grates are totally clogged. The weir
length of the entrance to the flume shall be sufficiently sized to convey that
flow from the street gutter to the flume without allowing overtopping of the
street curb or exceeding street water depth design criteria.
      (15)   Concrete flumes that serve as the primary conveyance avenue in a
sump position shall be designed for the 100-year storm event flow under the
conditions that all upstream inlets and grates are clogged. The weir length of
the entrance to the flume shall be sufficiently sized to convey that flow from
the street gutter to the flume without allowing overtopping of the street curb
or exceeding street water depth design criteria.
      (16)   A flume on grade where the gutter velocity for the 100-year storm
event exceeds five fps shall not be allowed as an acceptable method to remove
flow from the street due to the high likelihood that the flume entrance will be
bypassed by the flow.
      (17)   The weir length of the entrance to a flume on grade shall be
designed and accounted for when calculating the amount of flow intercepted by
the flume.
      (18)   All bar ditches and driveway culverts shall be designed by the
engineer to convey the 100-year storm event. The minimum acceptable driveway
culvert diameter is 18 inches. The maintenance of the bar ditch is the
responsibility of the property owner. It is encouraged that bar ditches in
residential developments have a maintenance program carried out by the property
owners’ association.
      (19)   Reinforced concrete box structures shall have an apron reinforced
with rebar. The apron shall be tied to the box structure with rebar and have a
toe wall. Adequately sized riprap shall protect the end of the apron and toe
wall from scour during the 100-year storm event. Energy dissipaters also shall
be used where riprap alone is inadequate to reduce discharge velocities.
Sandstone boulders or blocks shall not be used as riprap or energy dissipaters.
The reinforced concrete box structure shall be designed to have a minimum
freeboard at its inlet from the 100-year storm event water surface elevation to
its low chord equal to 15% of the box culvert rise or two feet, whichever is
less, to help compensate for potential blockage from debris during flooding.
The use of Manning’s Equation for sizing reinforced concrete box structures at
street crossings shall not be acceptable.
      (20)   Span bridges shall be designed to have a minimum freeboard at the
inlet from the 100-year storm event water surface elevation to its low chord
equal to 15% of the structure’s rise or one foot, whichever is less. The use of
Manning’s Equation for sizing span bridges at street crossings shall not be
acceptable.
      (21)   All other culverts shall be designed to have a minimum freeboard
at the inlet from the 100-year storm event water surface elevation to its low
chord equal to 15% of its rise of two feet, whichever is less. The use of
Manning’s Equation for sizing culverts at street crossings shall not be
acceptable.
   (G)   Sump position flood protection.
      (1)   In a location where the storm sewer improvements already have been
constructed, the structure shall have its minimum finished floor including
electrical and mechanical equipment servicing the structure, but excluding
ductwork, two feet above the highest elevation of either the top of the curb
elevation at the sump inlets or flume or two feet above the top of the curb
elevation of the overflow flume at its entrance. In lieu of this division (G)
(1), division (G)(2) below shall be allowed.
      (2)   If the builder so chooses, he or she shall provide to the city a
hydrologic and hydraulic drainage study and model prepared by a registered
professional engineer licensed to practice in the state using HEC-RAS or other
program acceptable by the City Engineer. The model shall be based on surveyed
data accompanied by a proposed grading plan, proposed site plan and any
proposed drainage structures or alterations of existing structures. The model
shall demonstrate that even though the proposed structure would not be
compliant with the minimum finished floor elevation required in division (G)(1)
above, the following design criteria shall be met.
         (a)   The proposed structure shall have at least two feet of freeboard
on all sides from the 100-year storm event water surface elevation on and/or
immediately adjacent to the lot and the proposed finished floor of the
structure including all mechanical and electrical equipment servicing the
structure, but excluding ductwork. A proposed structure with a basement of
walk-out shall be reviewed by the City Engineer to determine if the two- foot
freeboard requirement shall apply to it; the decision shall be based on the
proposed building plans, site plan, location of the sump position and the
likelihood of flooding.
         (b)   At no location would the 100-year storm event flood water come
in contact with the proposed structure of its mechanical and electrical
equipment.
         (c)   This modeling shall be done with runoff quantities calculated as
specified previously under the conditions that all of the upstream inlets and
grates are 50% clogged, while any existing inlets and/or grates at the sump
position are totally clogged. The model shall demonstrate where and at what
depth the flow overtops any curbs and the flowpath(s) the runoff will take via
flumes, swales and overland in the vicinity of the property. Flow velocities
also shall be provided.
      (3)   If the above are adequately demonstrated, the city shall be allowed
to approve the building of the proposed structure in accordance with the
submitted model and plans. The city may require a drainage easement or other
remedies to help ensure that the structure shall be safe from flooding. The
city may schedule the item for discussion at a regularly scheduled Council
meeting.
      (4)   For new developments and site plans, the sump position locations
shall be designed so that when all upstream inlets and grates are 50% clogged,
the sump position inlets and/or grates, or flume if no storm sewer is present,
shall handle the 100-year storm event without exceeding depth-in-street design
criteria. Clogging factors shall be applied to the sump position inlets and/or
grates during their design. All flume entrances shall have sufficient weir
length.
      (5)   In addition, an emergency overflow flume shall be provided for sump
position inlets and/or grates. The overflow flume shall be sized to handle the
100-year storm event under the conditions that the existing inlets and/or
grates at the sump position are 100% blocked and all upstream inlets and grates
are partially clogged per design standards. The flume entrance shall have
sufficient weir length to capture this flow and the flow shall remain within
the flume to the back of the lot(s). A sufficiently sized drainage easement,
minimum 15 feet, shall be provided.
      (6)   If all of the above conditions are met, a proposed structure in a
sump position shall be built as follows.
         (a)   Where a storm sewer system with the emergency overflow flume
exists, a minimum of one foot of freeboard shall be required from the finished
floor of the structure’s leading edge closest to the sump position to the top
of the flume curb immediately adjacent to it.
         (b)   Where a flume serves as the primary method of storm water
conveyance, a minimum of two feet of freeboard shall be required from the
finished floor of the structure’s leading edge closest to the sump position to
the top of the flume curb immediately adjacent to it.
      (7)   In both situations, the electrical and mechanical equipment
servicing the structure shall conform to the freeboard requirement; the
ductwork is excluded.
      (8)   The developer is encouraged to submit as-built survey data and
corresponding drainage calculations to the city upon completion of the
development’s infrastructure as soon as possible so that the staff can verify
that the sump positions meet the design criteria. By doing so, delays in
issuing building permits at these sump positions will be minimized.
      (9)   For rural developments or site plans, the applicant for a proposed
sump position structure shall submit to the city a proposed grading plan signed
and sealed by a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in the
state. The grading plan shall include the proposed site plan including
driveway, topographic data, bar ditches, channels, swales, creeks, easements,
proposed grading, proposed swales, minimum finished floor elevations, and any
additional drainage improvements required to ensure that the structure shall be
safe from flooding.

depth of flooding.
      (4)   The storm events to be modeled shall be the two-, five-, ten-, 25-,
50- and 100-year storm events.
      (5)   In the event peak flow studies indicate a development will increase
runoff or depth of flooding, then storage facilities or alternative methods of
storm water runoff control will be required.
      (6)   The City Council shall review all storm water storage studies and
shall implement the conditions of this section of these drainage standards.
      (7)   Storage may be accomplished by the detention or retention of water
in reservoirs, parks, side channels or ponds either on or off-site.
      (8)   In the event a complete drainage study by a licensed professional
engineer demonstrates through that an increase in downstream flooding would
occur if on-site storm water detention was provided or that there would be no
detrimental effect to all upstream, adjacent and downstream properties if storm
water detention was not provided, the requirement for storm water storage may
be waived by the City Council.
      (9)   An engineer submitting a request to waive the storm water storage
requirement will be required to produce a detailed drainage study containing
any information necessary for the city to make a determination. No limits of
the extent of a study should be assumed by an engineer as none are provided.
      (10)   The detention facility shall be designed based upon the maximum
allowable release rates. The release rates will be established based upon
natural state runoff characteristics from the development site. A continuous
probability or recurrence interval criterion shall be used in designing the
outlet control structure. As a minimum the outlet control structure shall be
designed for the two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year recurrence intervals.
      (11)   When a combination of storage facilities are used to control
runoff, the system as a whole shall be designed with discharge rates in
accordance with division (H)(10) above.
      (12)   All storage facilities shall be provided with a paved or otherwise
scour-protected emergency spillway sized to handle the 500-year event storm
with one foot of freeboard and provide scour protection at its downstream end.
Earth embankments shall have side slopes not steeper than 4:1 (horizontally:
vertically). Proper materials shall be specified with the corresponding optimum
compaction according to standards to provide stability and minimum seepage.
      (13)   The outlet to a detention pond should extend to the storm sewer,
creek, or other suitable location covered by a drainage easement.
      (14)   The engineer shall take into account the flow that would be
discharged through the emergency overflow spillway during the 100-year storm
event with total blockage of all other outlets of the detention pond when
designing the emergency spillway, and shall provide a safe means to convey the
water without adversely affecting downstream properties.
      (15)   The storage volume of a storage facility shall be oversized 10% to
allow for sedimentation.
      (16)   All storage ponds shall be provided with a concrete paved trickle
channel from the inlet to the outlet structure to transmit low flows.
      (17)   Suitable access shall be provided to all storage areas for
maintenance purposes.
      (18)   Maintenance of storage facilities shall be provided by the
property owners’ association.
      (19)   Earth dams or other earth embankments shall be designed by a
licensed professional engineer in accordance with accepted engineering
practices to assure that dam or embankment failure will not occur. Design
criteria used by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly
the Soil Conservation Service, in the selection of materials and construction
procedures will be acceptable.
      (20)   Parking lot detention may be utilized upon approval of the City
Engineer. The use of parking lots for storage shall be well-designed to
minimize the potential damage and/or threat to pedestrians, emergency
responders and vehicles, and parked vehicles. Where parking lot detention is
proposed:
         (a)   The maximum depth of the stored stormwater shall not be greater
than six inches;
         (b)   The maximum coverage of the parking area by the stored
stormwater shall not be greater than 35%; and
         (c)   Structures located on parcels with parking lot storage
facilities shall have finished floors 18 inches above the 100-year storm event
water surface elevation.
      (21)   Structures adjacent to a detention and/or retention site shall
have their finished floors (excluding ductwork) set at a minimum of two feet
above the 100-year storm event water surface elevation in the facility, and in
all cases a minimum of one foot of freeboard shall be provided from the
finished floor of the structures to the top of the projected 100-year water
surface elevation in the emergency spillway calculated under the conditions
that all other outlets of the pond are blocked.
      (22)   All detention bypass areas on the development must be identified.
Increased runoff from bypass areas shall not detrimentally affect adjacent and
downstream properties.
      (23)   All storage facilities shall be provided with landscaping which
includes the planting of appropriate trees and shrubs. The use of evergreen and
wetlands adaptable plantings should be incorporated to improve the water
quality of the storage runoff.
      (24)   Outlet control facilities shall include headwalls, slopewalls,
energy dissipaters and any additional outlet erosion and scour control measures
approved by the city. The outlet facilities, as a visible part of any storage

for detention or drainage shall be solid slab sodded with Bermuda grass sod
from a local source or have permanent established growth of vegetation. All
vegetation areas shall be fertilized, watered and in an established growing
condition with permanent vegetation prior to completion or acceptance of any
storm water drainage facility, and/or development.
   (B)   Design considerations.
      (1)   General design principles. Practical combinations of the following
principles shall be utilized, as a minimum, in planning measures to be
installed for any land disturbing activity.
         (a)    The land disturbing activity shall conform to existing
topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion
potential.
         (b)   The disturbed area and the duration of exposure of bare earth to
erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum through construction
scheduling and management.
         (c)   Cut and fill operations should be kept to a minimum.
         (d)   Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
         (e)   Natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented
whenever feasible.
         (f)   Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed in a timely
manner to protect exposed critical areas during development.
         (g)   Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures
shall be installed prior to final acceptance of developments or as soon as
seasonal planting restrictions allow.
      (2)   General practice. Soil and water conservation measures include, but
are not necessarily restricted to, vegetation, mulches, sediment basins, dikes,
grade stabilization structures, sediment traps, land grading, diversions,
waterways or outlets, and riprap.
      (3)   Vegetative practices. Vegetative practices shall be applied to
control erosion. The practice can be either temporary and/or permanent
depending on the site specific needs.
   (C)   Erosion and sediment control criteria.
      (1)   Long-term permanent vegetative cover obtained through seeding,
mulching, sprigging, sodding, or planting using acceptable varieties such as
Bermuda grass, Kentucky 31 Tall Fescue or Weeping Lovegrass shall be used to
control erosion on a permanent basis.
      (2)   Short-term vegetative cover through seeding or mulching using small
grains like oats, rye and wheat, and sundans and sorghums, shall be used to
control immediate erosion. This practice may be effective for areas where soil
is left exposed for a period of six to 12 months and shall not be deemed
permanent erosion control.
      (3)   Straw bale dikes may only be utilized where no other practice such
as silt dikes or silt fences are feasible.
      (4)   Solid slab sod shall be used for all open channels, bar ditches,
storage facilities and other steep slopes.
      (5)   Hay and sod mulching, as a temporary measure, may be used for
embankment stabilization in other areas where surface runoff is to be directed
down a slope.
      (6)   A coarse rock stabilized construction entrance shall be built in
accordance with the standard detail drawings to reduce or eliminate the
tracking or flowing of sediment onto the public right-of-way.
      (7)   A concrete or stone outlet structure shall be constructed in areas
where the entire drainage area to the structure is not stabilized or where
there is a need to dispose runoff at a protected outlet or where concentrated
flow for the duration of the period of construction needs to be diffused.
      (8)   A grade stabilization structure in the form of a paved chute or
flume shall be constructed to prevent erosion where concentrated flow of
surface runoff is to be conveyed down a slope of 3% or greater.
      (9)   Storm water detention facilities may be used temporarily as
sediment basins. A temporary outlet structure for the storm water detention
facility to work as a sediment pond shall be constructed. At the end of the
construction activity, the developer shall remove all collected sediment from
the detention facility and outlet structure and restore/construct the facility
to the approved detention design plans.
      (10)   The technologies and methodologies associated with erosion and
sediment control are continually being developed and modified. For the current
best management practices suggested for use, refer to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency website as well as recent publications by trade organizations
and others.
   (D)   New developments disturbing an area greater than one acre must obtain
authorization to discharge under the ODEQ general permit for storm water
discharge from construction activities.
      (1)   Notice of Intent (NOI) must be submitted to:

installed and maintained in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications and
good engineering practices. Maintenance and implementation of the controls will
be detailed in the erosion and storm water pollution control plan.
         (a)   Temporary best management practices.
            1.   Dikes;
            2.   Swales;
            3.   Silt fence. Silt fences can be constructed near the perimeter
of a disturbed area to intercept sediment while allowing water to percolate
through. Silt fences may not be used where there is a concentration of water in
a channel or other drainage;
            4.   Entrances. A stabilized entrance to all construction sites
shall be built to reduce or eliminate the tracking or flowing of sediment onto
public right-of-way;
            5.   Stone outlets. A stone outlet structure shall be constructed
in areas where the entire drainage area to the structure is not stabilized, or

concentrated flow for the period of construction needs to be diffused;
            6.   Paved chute. A grade stabilization structure in the form of a
paved chute or flume shall be constructed to prevent erosion, where
concentrated flow of surface runoff is to be conveyed down a slope. The maximum
allowable drainage area upstream of such a structure shall not exceed 36 acres;
            7.   Pipe slope drain. A grade stabilization structure in the form
of a pipe slope drain shall be constructed to prevent erosion, where
concentrated flow of surface runoff is to be conveyed down a slope. The maximum

               b.   At the end of the construction activity, the developer
shall make sure that the outlet structure shall meet the design requirements of
a storm water detention facility.
               c.   Condition of the detention facility that is used as a
sediment pond during construction, shall meet the following requirements at the
time of acceptance.
                  (i)   It shall be completely cleaned by the developer and be
rid of any immediate maintenance needs.
                  (ii)   It shall meet all design standards.
         (b)   Permanent best management practices.
            1.   Depending on the project layout, a division shall be
constructed across a slope less than 15% to:
               a.   Prevent runoff from higher areas having a potential for
causing erosion and thereby interfere with the establishment of vegetation on
lower areas; or
               b.   Reduce the length of slopes to minimize soil loss.
            2.   Divisions need be constructed only below stabilization or
protected areas.
            3.   Outlets from divisions shall be constructed to discharge in
such a manner as not to cause erosion. Outlets shall be constructed and
stabilized prior to the operation of diversion.
            4.   Storm drain outlet protection shall be provided when
converting pipe flow to channel flow. The reduction in velocity shall be
consistent with the roughness coefficient of the receiving waterway. The
reduction in velocity may be accomplished by:
               a.   Providing mortared riprap stabilization;
               b.   Providing energy dissipaters; and
               c.   Providing permanent vegetation, depending on the site
specific needs.
         (c)   Vegetation best management practices.
            1.   Vegetation practices. Vegetation practices can be applied very
effectively to control erosion. The practice can be either temporary or
permanent depending on the site specific needs. The specifications for
establishing vegetation both temporary and permanent are briefly outlined
below:
            2.   Temporary practices.
               a.   Small grains like oats, rye and wheat, and sorghums are the
most feasible temporary vegetation to control erosion. This practice is
effective for areas where soil is left exposed for a period of six to 12
months. The time period may be shorter during periods of erosion rainfall.
               b.   Prior to seeding, needed erosion control practices such as
diversions, grade stabilization structures, berms, dikes and the like, shall be
installed.
               c.   Temporary vegetative practice is usually applied prior to
the completion of final grading of the site.
               d.   If the area to be seeded has been recently loosened to the
extent that an adequate seedbed exists, no additional treatment is required.
However, if the area to be seeded is packed, crushed and hard, the top layer of
soil shall be loosened by other suitable means.
               e.   Fertilizer shall be applied at a rate of 600 pounds per
acre or 15 pounds per 1,000 square foot using 10-20-10, or equivalent.
               f.   Soils known to be highly acidic shall be lime treated.
               g.   Seeding requirements shall be as specified by the local
NRCS office.
               h.   Seeds shall be drilled uniformly.
               i.   Seeding implements should be used at right angles to the
general slope to minimize erosion.
               j.   After two to three months of planting, the seeded site
shall be top dressed with eight pounds per 1,000 square feet or 350 pounds per
acre of 33-0-0.
               k.   Areas that are not well covered shall be replanted.
               l.   The seeded area shall be watered when feasible and needed.
            3.   Permanent practices. Bermuda grass, Kentucky 31 Tall Fescue
and Old World Blue Stem are some of the permanent vegetation that could be
effectively used to control erosion.
               a.   Prior to seeding, needed erosion control practices such as
dikes, swales, diversions, and the like shall be installed.
               b.   The subgrade shall be loosened evenly to a depth of two to
three inches and 10-20-10 fertilizer (ten pounds per square feet or 450 pounds
per acre) shall be mixed with loosened surface soil by disking or other
suitable means.
               c.   Soils known to be highly acidic shall be lime treated.
               d.   Planting rate require- ments shall be as specified by the
local NRCS office.
               e.   Seeds shall be drilled uniformly.
               f.   Seeding implements should be used at right angles to
general slope to minimize erosion.
               g.   Mulch will be used where needed.
               h.   The area shall be watered daily, or as often as necessary
to maintain adequate soil moisture until the plants grow about one-half to one
inch.
            4.   Buffer strips. A vegetated buffer strip will be preserved
along both sides of all perennial and intermittent streams and adjacent
wetlands. The size and location of the buffer strip will be determined during
review of the erosion and sedimentation control plan, prior to any earth
disturbing activity. The naturally occurring vegetation in the buffer strip
shall not be disturbed. If any vegetation in the buffer strip is disturbed, it
shall be immediately restored as much a possible to its natural condition.
         (d)   Compliance.
            1.   Inspections. The city or its authorized representative shall
be permitted at all times to gain access to any site for purpose of inspection
or observation to determine compliance with this section.
            2.   Stop work order/revocation of permit. In the event that any
person violates the terms of this section, the city may require a stoppage of
work on the site until all violations are corrected. Any person engaged in
activities regulated by this section without first obtaining the required
approval, will be required to stop all work on the site until approval is
obtained.
            3.   Violation. Any person found in violation of the provisions of
this section will be denied issuance of any other permits, approvals or
inspections until the violation(s) is/are corrected, or written arrangements to
correct the violation(s) are submitted to and accepted by the city.
(2002 Code, § 153.091) (Ord. 651, passed 10-26-2009)
§ 153.998 VIOLATION.
   No building permit shall be issued for any new structure or change,
improvement or alteration of any existing structure on any tract of land in a
subdivision filed of record after the effective date of these regulations,
which does not comply with all the provisions of these regulations.
(2002 Code, § 153.998) (Ord. 651, passed 10-26-2009)

operate as such upon completion of all lot sales within the development in
which it is located. No structures, temporary or permanent, shall be used to

SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 154.075 “PUD” PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   General description. The Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is a
special zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to
conventional land use controls. The PUD process offers an opportunity for more
creative solutions to redevelopment issues while at the same time requiring a
proposal that conforms to the goals and policies of the city’s Comprehensive
Plan. The PUD is subject to special review procedures, and once approved by the
City Council it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it
represents. Any proposed modification in the form of a change in zoning of a
part of the PUD area constitutes a requirement to amend the entire PUD to
accommodate the area being excluded.
   (B)   Intent and purpose.
      (1)   Encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate
limitations on the character and intensity of use of the project to assure
compatibility with adjoining and neighborhood properties;
      (2)   Permit flexibility within the develop- ment to maximize the unique
physical features of the particular site;
      (3)   Encourage efficient use and re-use of land, and facilitate economic
arrangement of buildings and circulation systems;
      (4)   Achieve a continuity of function and design within the development
that results in an economically feasible project which conforms to the
Comprehensive Plan and is compatible with development patterns in the
surrounding neighbor- hood; and
      (5)   Provide a tool for negotiating modifications in standard zoning
district regulations in order to achieve innovative design solutions that will
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens.
   (C)   Planned unit development authorized.
      (1)   A PUD may be authorized by an amendment to the Official Zoning
Districts Map after public hearings by the Planning Commission and City
Council; provided, the PUD complies with the requirements contained herein.
      (2)   A PUD shall be considered a special zoning district, and it may be
authorized for any use or combination of uses permitted.
   (D)   Planned unit development submission requirements.
      (1)   The developer of a PUD shall follow a four-step application and
review procedure:
         (a)   Application for rezoning and submission of PUD master plan,
including design statement and master development plan map;
         (b)   Preliminary plat, where required by the subdivision regulations,
shall be submitted with the application for rezoning;
         (c)   Final plat, where required by the subdivision regulations; and
         (d)   Application for building permit and site plan review.
      (2)   Each required step shall be completed and approved before the
following step is reviewed. Where appropriate, other methods authorized in the
subdivision regulations may be substituted on divisions (D)(1)(c) and (D)(1)(d)
above. The Planning Commission and City Council may, however, review more than
one step at the same public hearing.
   (E)   Step 1 - planned unit development master plan. The basis for review
and approval of a PUD is the master plan, which shall be adopted as a part of
the ordinance of rezoning. The PUD master plan shall contain a design statement
and a master development plan map that shall include, at a minimum, the
following information:
      (1)   PUD design statement. The PUD design statement shall be a written
report containing the following elements:
         (a)   Title of the PUD;
         (b)   List of the property owners and proposed developers;
         (c)   Specific location of the proposal, and a legal description of
the property;
         (d)   Reference to the Comprehensive Plan policy for the subject
property, including a map showing zoning and land uses within a minimum of 300
feet of the subject; and
         (e)   A description of the development proposal including:
            1.   Existing and proposed land uses;
            2.   Existing and proposed densities where housing is involved;
            3.   Existing and proposed points of access;
            4.   Drainage information, including a topographic map of the
property with five-foot contours;
            5.   A description of building use types, proposed private
restrictions, and typical site layouts;
            6.   A list of all special development regulations requested and/or
the conventional zoning district regulations that will be applicable; and
            7.   A specific timetable for the development.
      (2)   Planned unit development master development plan map. The master
development plan map shall be a graphic representation of the plan for the PUD
area prepared at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet. It shall show, at a
minimum, the following:
         (a)   The subject property and sufficient surrounding area to
demonstrate the relationship of the PUD to adjoining uses, including
structures, streets and other physical features;
         (b)   Specific siting of planned buildings, parking, driveways,
landscaping and open space, utility easements, setbacks and other specific
information about the project;
         (c)   Detailed landscaping plans showing treatment of a minimum of 6%
of the lot area, plus street right-of-way; and
         (d)   Any other pertinent information necessary for review, approval
and administration of the PUD.
      (3)   Review and approval.
         (a)   The PUD application will be considered by the Planning
Commission and City Council at public hearings in accordance with established
review procedures for consideration of applications for rezoning. As a part of
the city review, the Planning Commission or City Council may require additional
information, including, but not limited to, the following: evidence of a market
feasibility study; drainage study or other engineering data and plans;
infrastructure improvements or dedication of necessary easements and rights-of-
way; developer meetings with surrounding property owners; re-platting; building
elevations; specific plat restrictions, covenants, height, use, setback or
coverage requirements; creation of a property owners’ association; performance
bond or other surety for required public improvements.
         (b)   Upon final approval by the City Council of the PUD master plan
and the appropriate ordinance of rezoning, these elements shall become a part
of the Official Zoning Districts Map. The ordinance of rezoning shall adopt the
PUD master plan and all supporting documentation by reference, and it shall
become a part of the official records of the city.
         (c)   The PUD master plan shall control the development of the
property, and all building permits shall be in accord with the plan until it is
otherwise amended by the City Council. The developer shall furnish a
reproducible copy of the master plan map at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet
for signature by the Chair of the Planning Commission and the Mayor, with
acknowledgment by the City Clerk. The PUD master plan, including the signed map
and all supporting data, shall be made a part of the permanent file and
maintained by the City Clerk.
   (F)   Step 2 - preliminary plat. Upon submission of the PUD master plan and
request for rezoning, the developer shall prepare a preliminary plat of the
entire development area. Where a recorded plat for the entire area comprising
the proposed PUD already exists, and where there will be no sale of lots which
do not conform to the platted lot lines, the Planning Commission may waive the
platting requirements.
   (G)   Step 3 - final plat. Where a subdivision plat has been required, the
developer shall prepare a final plat, or plats in the case of sequential
development, for review, approval and filling of record according to procedures
established by the Planning Commission and City Council. In addition to these
procedures the final plat shall include:
      (1)   Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of common open space.
This open space may be dedicated to a private association or to the public;
provided that, a dedication to the public shall not be accepted without the
approval of the City Council;
      (2)   A homeowners’ or property owners’ association shall be created if
other satisfactory arrangements have not been made for improving, operating and
maintaining common facilities, including private street drives, service and
parking areas and recreation areas; and
      (3)   Covenants shall be submitted to reasonably ensure the continued
compliance with the approved PUD master plan. If there is no plat required,
then divisions (G)(1) and (G)(2) above shall be submitted and approved as part
of the PUD master plan at the time of rezoning.
   (H)   Step 4 - building permit application and site plan review. A site plan
for the area to be developed within the PUD shall be submitted with the
application for a building permit and shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and City Council for conformance with the standards established in
the PUD master development plan. No building permit shall be issued by the city
for the PUD area until these requirements have been met.
   (I)   Review, approval and administrative procedures.
      (1)   Steps 1, 2 and 3 of the PUD application process will be considered
by the Planning Commission and City Council at public hearings in accordance
with established review procedures for consideration of applications for
rezoning and subdivisions. As a part of the city review, the Planning
Commission or City Council may require additional information, including, but
not limited to, the following: evidence of a market feasibility study; drainage
study or other engineering data and plans; infrastructure improvements or
dedication of necessary easements and rights-of-way; developer meetings with
surrounding property owners; re-platting; building elevations; specific plat
restrictions, covenants, height, use, setback or coverage requirements;
creation of a property owners’ association; performance bond or other surety
for required public improvements.
      (2)   Upon final approval by the City Council of the PUD master plan and
the appropriate ordinance of rezoning, these elements shall become a part of
the Official Zoning Districts Map. The ordinance of rezoning shall adopt the
PUD master plan and all supporting documentation by reference, and it shall
become a part of the official records of the city.
      (3)   The PUD master plan shall control the development of the property,
and all building permits shall be in accord with that plan until it is
otherwise amended by the City Council. The developer shall furnish a
reproducible copy of the master plan map at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet
for signature by the Chair of the Planning Commission and the Mayor, with
acknowledgment by the City Clerk. The PUD master plan, including the signed map
and all supporting data, shall be made a part of the permanent file and
maintained by the City Clerk.
      (4)   No building permit shall be issued by the city for the PUD area
until these requirements have been met.
   (J)   Abandonment or amendment.
      (1)   If the property owner determines to abandon the PUD zoning, he or
she shall make application for rezoning either to the original status or to a
new classification. The application shall be heard by the Planning Commission
and City Council according to regular zoning change procedures.
      (2)   (a)   An application for rezoning to change part of the area of a
PUD to a different zoning district classification shall be considered an
amendment of the original PUD. The Planning Commission shall review the
commitments and provisions of the original PUD as approved to determine the
impact of the new application on the PUD.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may require consideration of an
amendment to the entire PUD as an element of the proposed zoning change.

      WHIP ANTENNA. An omni-directional dipole antenna of cylindrical shape
which is no more than six inches in diameter.
   (C)   Communications devices subject to a special permit in general.
      (1)   It is the intent of this division to establish special permit
requirements for the location of communications towers and antennas which:
provide service for wireless telephones; provide for the needs of commercial
broadcasters; and establish standards for large private communications devices
serving as an accessory to a business located on the same property as the
primary use. Because the city is a developing community with extensive open
spaces, it is essential to promote public safety and preserve public and
private neighborhood assets by limiting the height and location of these
facilities to minimize their impact on present and future adjacent land uses.
Therefore, wireless telephone systems and commercial broadcasters are
encouraged to locate communications devices on existing towers and non-
residential structures; and other location requirements are established to
serve as minimum standards for consideration during the special permit review
process.
      (2)   The following communications devices are permitted subject to the
special permit regulations of this chapter and the specific requirements listed
in this section.
         (a)   Communications tower, subject to the following requirements:
            1.   Location requirements. To be eligible for a special permit for
construction of a communications tower, a site must be located on property that
is:
               a.   Classified in an office, retail commercial or industrial
zoning district; or
               b.   In a residential zoned district where there are no
residential uses with a property line within 300 feet of the base of the tower;
or
               c.   Owned by the city.
            2.   Height requirements. Com- munications towers shall be subject
to all height limitations related to airport environs and flight safety; plus
the following zoning district standards, whichever are the most restrictive:
               a.   Agricultural and industrial zoning districts: maximum
height is subject to spacing and height requirements of this section and other
applicable city codes;
               b.   Retail commercial zoning districts and municipally owned
property: maximum height of 150 feet; and
               c.   All other permitted zoning districts: maximum height of 80
feet.
            3.   Spacing requirements.
               a.   A site for a new telecommunications tower taller than 80
feet in height shall be located a minimum distance of one-half mile from
another telecommunications tower, including towers located outside the
corporate limits of the city.
               b.   A site for a new telecommunications tower that exceeds 35
feet in height shall be located a minimum distance of one- fourth mile from
another telecommunications tower, including towers located outside the
corporate limits of the city.
            4.   Setback requirements.
               a.   Except as provided in the location requirements above, all
towers shall be located so as to provide a minimum distance equal to 125% of
the height of the tower from the tower base to the property line of a
residential use.
               b.   All tower sites shall observe a minimum setback from their
boundary fence to any abutting street right-of-way of 25 feet.

or signage shall be allowed on any tower.
         (b)   At-grade dish antenna or antennas, with a diameter exceeding two
meters, subject to the following requirements.
            1.   Location requirements. Properties eligible for consideration
for a special permit for location of these antennas shall include appropriately
zoned retail commercial, office and institutional or not-for-profit
developments. Because of the lower height profile possible with these devices,
municipal-owned properties may also be considered suitable for location of one
or more of these antennas.
            2.   Height requirements. Maximum height of equipment and antennas:
ten feet.
            3.   Setback requirements.
               a.   All antenna sites in this category shall observe a minimum

architectural element of an existing or proposed structure, including, but not
necessarily limited to, church steeple, bell tower, arch or clock tower.
               c.   Design: Consideration should be given to the ability of the
applicant to integrate the design and location of the device into the design of
the existing structure with the objective of rendering the device
indistinguishable as an antenna.
            2.   Height and overall size. No element of the antenna shall be
extended above the height, or outside the confines, of the structure of which
it is a part.
   (D)   Communication devices permitted by right. The following communications
devices do not require a special permit and may be installed if they meet all
requirements of this division (D) and this chapter; provided that, a building
permit shall be required when there are structural modifications required for
the installation of the device.
      (1)   These are intended solely for the non-commercial use of a
residential property owner, including, but not necessarily limited to, a
monopole, dish antenna two meters or less in diameter, and whip antenna. These
devices shall be considered as accessory uses subject to plat and deed
restrictions and the following requirements:
         (a)   Maximum height:
            1.   Freestanding monopole or whip antenna: the height limit of the
zoning district or the plat restrictions, whichever is the lesser; and

(2002 Code, § 154.072) (Ord. 486, passed 5-12-2003; Ord. 515, passed 5-10-2004)
§ 154.093 OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING AND ACCESS REGULATIONS.
   (A)   General description and purpose. The intent of this chapter is to
require proper access and adequate off-street parking and loading facilities
for each use of land within the city, based on the demand created by each use.
      (1)   Off-street parking and loading required. Permanent off-street
parking and loading areas in the amount specified in this chapter for each use
shall be provided at any time a building is constructed; or at the time a main
building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding dwelling units; guest
rooms, seats, or floor area; or before conversion from one type of use to
another.
      (2)   Use of public right-of-way prohibited. No portion of any required
off-street parking space shall occupy or use any street, right-of-way, alley or
other public property. Parking spaces that use any street or public right-of-
way as a direct means of access without the intermediate use of service aisle
and entrances of at least the minimum standards specified in this chapter shall
be prohibited. A public alley shall be the only public right-of-way area
permitted for maneuvering space to reach a required parking stall.
      (3)   Minimum standards and property owner responsibility. The standards
contained in this section represent the minimum requirements. It shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to certify, at the time he or she applies
for a building permit, that his or her plan is adequate to provide sufficient
spaces and facilities necessary to assure that no activity will take place on
public streets or property. Any use developed after the date of adoption of
these requirements which fails to provide for off-street parking, loading and
access needs shall be in violation of this chapter. Upon determination by the
city that a property owner has not provided adequate parking or loading space
to serve his or her operation, the property owner shall be required to either
develop additional parking or loading space or reduce the size of the operation
to fit the space available.
      (4)   Ownership or control. The land on which the off-street parking or
loading facility is located shall be owned or controlled by the same entity
which owns or controls the land on which the principal use is located. Such
ownership or control shall be evidenced by a legal instrument duly recorded.
   (B)   Administration and enforcement.
      (1)   New construction or remodeling in all zoning districts. No building
permit shall be approved until a plan has been reviewed and approved by the
city as a part of the building and site plan review process. No certificate of
occupancy shall be issued until all off-street parking and/or loading
facilities have been constructed in accordance with the approved building
permit.
      (2)   Plan and information required. The applicant for a building permit
for new construction, expansion, or remodeling shall submit a plan showing the
number, location, and size of parking spaces. The applicant shall submit
information regarding the projected number of employees, seating capacities,
gross floor area, customer service area, gross leasable area, number of
dwelling units, and any other appropriate data necessary to verify compliance
with these requirements.
      (3)   Plans for surfacing of parking areas. Plans for surfacing of all
off-street parking areas, aisles and access driveways, including detailed
drainage plans, shall be reviewed and approved by the city for compliance with
city specifications.
      (4)   Permits required. Permits for construction of driveways, aprons or
approaches in all zoning districts are required and required improvements must
meet city specifications.
      (5)   Interpretation and appeal. If questions of interpretation or
application of these requirements to particular uses or structures arise, the
city shall, based on findings of fact, make a determination of the off-street
parking, loading or access requirements. Any aggrieved property owner may
appeal such determination to the Board of Adjustment as a part of the building
permit application review process.
   (C)   Special considerations.
      (1)   Remote parking. If the off-street parking space required by this
section cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal
use is located, such space may be provided on a separate lot in accordance with
standards established herein.
      (2)   Joint parking facilities. The required parking space for any number
of separate uses may be combined in a joint parking facility under the
following conditions:
         (a)   Multiple ownerships or structures. Where there are multiple
ownerships or structures, each owner shall provide evidence of a permanent
legal instrument which has been filed of record with the County Clerk and which
guarantees permanent right to use of the parking facility.
         (b)   Churches. One-half of the required parking spaces for churches
may be included in the total of required parking spaces for other uses that do
not operate after 6:00 p.m. or on Sundays, provided that the nearest property
line of the parking area is located within 200 feet of the church property
line.
         (c)   Specific uses. The required parking spaces, for the uses
specifically listed below, shall be permitted to be reduced by one-half;
provided, they are part of a shopping or office complex of one or more
buildings which have a total of 48,000 square feet or more of gross floor area
and which share joint access and parking facilities as described above; and
provided further that the gross floor area of all of these uses listed below in
the building or complex shall not exceed 20% of the total gross floor area of
the building or complex. Any gross floor area in excess of 20% shall require
parking spaces to be provided, according to the regular standards contained in
this chapter. The uses subject to this provision are:
            1.   Eating establishments: sit-down, alcohol permitted or not
permitted;
            2.   Drinking establishments: sit-down, alcohol permitted; and
            3.   Theaters or auditoriums.
         (d)   Shared parking - cumulative effect. Where more than one facility
shows evidence of joint use agreements for common access and a cross parking
arrangement resulting in reduced street access points, parking requirements
will be based on the cumulative gross floor area of all structures.
      (3)   Striping required. Off-street parking areas shall be designed to
provide systematic and orderly circulation, traffic separation devices and
parking spaces in accordance with sound traffic engineering practices.
         (a)   All off-street parking spaces and the means of ingress and
egress shall be laid out on the parking surface with paint or plastic striping
which provides a permanent delineation between spaces, aisles and surrounding
structures and land.
         (b)   No striping shall be required on lots having only single-family
or residential structures.
      (4)   Separation from public right-of-way. All off-street parking areas,
aisles and access driveways
shall be designed so that vehicles do not overhang public rights-of-way or
adjacent property.
      (5)   Lighting.
         (a)   All outdoor parking lots that serve commercial and institutional
uses shall be illuminated during the evening hours of operation. Evening hours
shall be deemed to begin one-half hour after sunset.
         (b)   All lighting equipment used in illumination of off-street
parking areas shall not create a nuisance or hazard for streets or adjoining
properties.
      (6)   Clearance.
         (a)   There shall be a minimum vertical clearance, free of all
obstructions to a height of ten feet, for all portions of any off-street
parking space, except when off-street parking spaces are provided in a parking
structure, a residential garage or carport. No obstruction shall project into
this minimum clearance.
         (b)   There shall be no obstruction within or near the bounds of any
required off-street parking space which would interfere with the normal
availability and use thereof.
      (7)   Landscaping required. All property used solely for off-street
parking lots shall comply with the landscaping requirements of this chapter.
      (8)   Paving required. All required off-street parking and drives within
the parking lot shall be permanently paved with a hard surface pavement that is
a minimum of two inches of hot asphaltic concrete on a four-inch compacted base
or an equivalent thereto.
      (9)   Parking lot maintenance. Parking lots in commercial districts shall
be maintained free of potholes and areas of crumbling, broken pavement, or
exposed base material. When more than 10% of the total parking lot pavement
area is in such condition, the property owner shall, in accordance with city
construction standards, repair the affected area at his or her expense within
60 days following notification by the city.
      (10)   Handicapped parking requirements. As a part of the minimum parking
space requirements established in the Americans for Disabilities Act and this
chapter, special parking spaces shall be designated for sole use by the
handicapped, for all uses other than one- through four-family residential, in
accordance with the following standards:
         (a)   If less than 20 regular spaces are required, then one such space
shall be designated as handicapped parking.
         (b)   If 20 or more spaces are required, then not less than 2% of all
parking spaces, with a minimum of two, shall be designated as handicapped
parking.
         (c)   A handicapped parking space shall be not less than 13 feet in
width. This shall include a stall width of nine feet and a four-foot-wide
pedestrian aisle on one side of the space.
         (d)   Where the pedestrian aisle of the space is provided at curbside,
a ramp to the sidewalk level shall be constructed at the end of the aisle, in
any event, a ramp from the parking area to each entrance sidewalk shall be
required.
         (e)   All handicapped parking spaces shall be permanently marked or
striped with paint or other device. In addition, each space shall be identified
by a pole mounted sign or by a wall sign, at the option of the developer, if
the space is adjacent to a building. The center of the sign shall be not lower
than four feet or more than six feet above the parking surface.
         (f)   Handicapped parking spaces shall be placed as near as possible
to building entrances or centrally located in parking lots between buildings.
         (g)   Parallel parking spaces shall not be used for handicapped
parking.
   (D)   Specific parking requirements and exceptions.
      List of specific standards. Uses that are included in this chapter are
detailed below. Each use has a specific parking standard that shall be met. In
certain cases, where a use has no specific standard determined in advance by
these requirements, the City Council shall make a determination of need after
review of the site plan.

   (E)   Parking area design standards.
      (1)   Parking stall. Minimum size: nine feet wide, 18 feet long.
      (2)   Loading/unloading (queuing) spaces.
         (a)   No queuing space may occupy any portion of a public right-of-
way.
         (b)   Queuing spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet in width and 18
feet in length.
         (c)   Queuing spaces may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking
or loading requirements of this section.
         (d)   Queuing spaces may be provided in the primary access aisle
leading to a drive-in or drive-through facility.
      (3)   Aisle requirements.
         (a)   Aisles providing access to off-street parking areas, but not
immediately adjacent to or providing direct access to an off-street parking
space, shall be at least 22 feet in width if designed for two- way traffic and
at least 12 feet in width if designed for one-way traffic.
         (b)   A drive-in window shall not project more than one foot into the
minimum aisle width.
      (4)   Exceptions to basic standards.
         (a)   Family estate, single-family and duplex structures may use a
paved driveway to fulfill the minimum parking requirements. The driveway space
for each automobile shall be a minimum of nine feet in width and 18 feet in
length and shall not be located within five feet of the street pavement.
         (b)   Where a multiple purpose retail, institutional or industrial
building is proposed to be occupied by a use which can be demonstrated by the
occupant to require less parking than the standards contained herein, the city
may permit, subject to City Council approval, paving of a smaller parking area
to meet the estimated need; provided, however, that, the balance of the land
required by these requirements shall be held in reserve as an unpaved area to
meet future needs generated by an expansion of the business or a change in land
use.
         (c)   For mixed uses containing any combination of retail,
institutional, office, manufacturing and industrial, or warehousing activity,
parking requirements shall be tabulated separately for each use within the
development using the list of specific standards or the tables above. Mixed
uses regulated under separate parking requirements shall not be combined to
achieve a larger square footage total that would result in a reduced parking
requirement. Where any part of a mixed use is converted to another use
category, then the parking requirements shall be recalculated based on the new
square footage figure.
         (c)   Where a manufacturing and industrial use has more than one
working shift of employees, parking facilities shall be adequate to accommodate
overlap requirements during transition periods.
   (F)   Off-street loading/unloading spaces for industrial, commercial and
institutional buildings.
      (1)   Requirement. Every industrial, commercial, and civic building
erected or expanded shall provide space, as indicated herein, for loading and
unloading of vehicles and hauling trailers. The number of spaces required shall
be considered as the absolute minimum, and the owner/applicant shall evaluate
his or her own needs to determine if they are greater than the minimum
specified.
      (2)   Size. All off-street loading and unloading spaces shall have
minimum dimensions of 12 feet by 60 feet with a 15-foot overhead clearance. In
no case shall required off-street loading and unloading spaces encroach upon
off-street parking space required in this code, or on a public right-of-way. No
maneuvering shall be permitted on a public right-of-way.
      (3)   Design. Off-street loading and unloading spaces shall be designed
so that vehicles shall maneuver entirely within the property lines of the
premises and not on a public right-of-way. Unenclosed off-street loading and
unloading areas shall be permanently paved with hard surfaced pavement. A six-
inch header curb must also be constructed to separate a loading area from a
public right-of-way.
      (4)   Minimum. Table 5, below, sets forth the minimum number of loading/
unloading spaces required by use category according to gross floor area:

      (1)   No dumpster or receptacle shall be placed in a required parking
space.
      (2)   Dumpsters and receptacles designed for transfer and unloading by
trucks shall not be located where they interfere with traffic circulation or
access to parking spaces and shall have a permanent location pad or enclosure
and access way designed and constructed in accordance with the city code
standards.
      (3)   Dumpsters and receptacles shall be provided with a pad, and an
access drive if necessary to enter private property, that is designed and
constructed to standards to city codes, with a minimum standard will provide
for support the weight of collection vehicles without contributing to the
destruction of the pavement.
   (H)   Access.
      (1)   Purpose. To provide access to private and public property in a
safe, efficient, and orderly manner that is compatible with the public
transportation system and to ensure orderly designs and proper location of
driveways that have a positive effect on traffic operations. In addition, this
section provides means for enhancing transportation movement and safety within
the city, including generally improved traffic capacity, maintaining uniform
traffic speeds and reducing accidents.
      (2)   Access to lots. To qualify for issuance of any new driveway permit
or approval of a new curb cut, each lot of record, regardless of zoning
district, must show access via a hard surface connection as defined in Appendix
A of this chapter to a public street, or private street that has been
recognized by the City Council as meeting all city requirements.
         (a)   Hard surface connections will be administratively reviewed if
access abuts a public or private road not in compliance with city standards
according to Ch. 153, Appendix A.
      (3)   Curb cut permit. No person shall cut or remove curbing or construct
a driveway onto a street without securing a permit from the city. All costs to
construct or remove curbs and driveways shall be the responsibility of the
applicant. Any roadway improvement that is designed to provide access to a lot
shall also be the responsibility of the applicant. All curb cuts, new
construction and curb replacement shall conform to city design and construction
standards.
      (4)   Access to streets: single- and two-family residences. Single- and
two-family residences in all zoning districts shall be permitted curb cuts for
driveway access to streets as follows:
         (a)   Maximum number of curb cuts:
            1.   One curb cut per street frontage; or
            2.   Two curb cuts on the same street frontage for a circular drive
on an interior lot. In E-1, E-2, and E-3 zoning districts, two separate curb
cuts may be permitted without a circular drive and shall not be closer to the
property line than the district’s side or rear yard setback; or
            3.   Three curb cuts on a corner lot to accommodate a circular
drive and a driveway to provide access to a garage or rear yard; or
            4.   Two-family residences shall be permitted one curb cut per
residence on the same street frontage, provided there is a minimum separation
of three feet between curb cuts for connected dwelling units.
         (b)   Curb cut dimensions: Regardless of the width of the driveway,
the maximum width of curb cuts for single and two-family residential uses shall
be 24 feet.
      (5)   Access to major streets: single-family to four-family residences.
         (a)   In no case shall a residential structure with four or less
dwelling units be allowed access onto a highway or section line road if direct
access is available onto a collector, or local street. Residential structures,
or complexes of five or more dwelling units under the same ownership, shall be
required to follow the general access provisions set forth in this chapter.
         (b)   Driveways shall be configured with an adequate turnaround or
maneuvering area on the premises to permit all vehicles to access the street by
moving in a forward direction rather than having to back into the roadway.
      (6)   Restricted access to residential areas. The City Council shall have
the authority to restrict access into a residential zoned neighborhood from any
industrial, commercial, multiple-family and other non-residential uses,
including churches and other institutional uses. It may direct that no curb
cuts be
placed on that portion of a local residential street adjacent to the
commercially zoned tract if it determines:
         (a)   That such access will create unwarranted traffic that could
adversely affect the safety, security and stability of the neighborhood; and
         (b)   There is sufficient access from other streets serving the same
development parcel.
   (I)   Corner clearance and separation requirements for driveways.
      (1)   Driveways shall be separated from street intersections and other
driveways by the distances defined in Table 6.
         (a)   These distances shall be measured from the centerline of streets
to the curb line of driveways, excluding radii.
         (b)   These requirements shall be applied to strip developments having
multiple ownership and to developments of all sizes under one ownership.
         (c)   Where a property has less frontage than the minimum requirements
contained in Table 6 below, a driveway shall still be permitted for each street
frontage, provided that it is located at a point of maximum separation from the
nearest street (first priority) and nearest driveway (second priority).
      (2)   Design.
         (a)   The intersection of a two-way driveway shall be designed to
intersect at a 90-degree angle.
         (b)   The corner radius of a driveway shall be no less than:
            1.   Fifteen feet for a local street;
            2.   Twenty feet for a collector street;
            3.   Twenty-five feet for a section line street or highway; and
            4.   Residential driveways on local or collector streets shall have
a minimum radius of three feet.
         (c)   A minimum sight distance of four hundred feet for vehicles
egressing a driveway to a section line road or highway shall be required for
each intersection. The sight distance shall be measured from a point on the
driveway at least 15 feet from the edge of the major road pavement and measured
from a height of eye of three and three-quarters feet on the driveway to a
height of an object of four and one-half feet on the major road.
         (d)   One-way egress driveways shall conform to the sight distance
requirements that are stated for two-way driveways. One-way egress driveways of
less than 90 degrees may be required by the city where it is determined that it
is in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare. All
driveways and access facilities shall be designed to meet the grade, alignment,
pavement and channelization standards and other specifications prescribed by
the city.

portion thereof, provided separate driveways, limited to one for entrance and one for
exit, may be approved by administrative review of the site design.
 
   (J)   Parking in setback area permitted. Private property that is required
to remain undeveloped for special setback line purposes may be improved for
surface-level off-street parking unless specifically restricted by a provision
of this code; provided that no improved or required off-street parking shall be
allowed within the first 40 feet from the above listed centerlines of all
section line roads, which shall be reserved for future street widening and
utility installation needs.
   (K)   Parking of mobile homes and miscellaneous trailers and commercial
vehicles.
      (1)   Boats, commercial and/or utility trailers, motor homes, campers or
camping trailers shall not be parked in front of the front building line
setback as established by the code of ordinances for more than seven days.
      (2)   A commercial and/or utility trailer shall not exceed 24 feet in
length or eight feet in width. Pickup mounted cambers shall not be included in
the above definition unless the vehicle is not used on a regular basis which
shall include being moved from the location at least once every seven days.
      (3)   A mobile home shall not be stored on a lot in a residential
district. This does not prohibit the use of a mobile home as a residence, in
those districts where a mobile home has been permitted as a residence.
      (4)   No commercial vehicle in excess of two axles or 15,000 pounds gross
weight shall be permitted to park on any lot which is zoned for residential
purposes under the R-F-l through R-MH-2 classifications, except where a yearly
permit is issued by the Code Enforcement Officer. The permit shall be issued
only if the following exist:

improvements contributing to the quality of life of the community. In
particular, all multiple-family, commercial, church, institutional and public
uses shall be landscaped with trees, ornamental shrubs and green areas
according to the following standards. Where on-site detention of storm water is
a development requirement, the required detention areas should be integrated
into the overall landscape design plan and may, therefore, be included in the
calculation of required area.
   (B)   Required area. The public right-of-way between the property line and
the curb and not less than 5% of the total area of the lot shall be landscaped.
At least 60% of the required landscape area shall be in the front or side yards

occupancy for a structure or use shall not be issued until landscaping has been
installed in accordance with the plan; provided, however, that if a structure
and all its site improvements are complete except for the landscaping
requirements and the season of the year will not permit planting, temporary
occupancy may be permitted until a date certain in the growing season. In this
case, a future inspection date shall be set by the city to determine that the
landscaping has been installed for issuance of a permanent certificate of
occupancy.
   (E)   Continuing maintenance. All landscaping shall be maintained in a live
and healthy condition by the property owner. Failure to install or maintain

§ 154.101 EXTERIOR BUILDING MATERIAL AND FAÇADE REQUIREMENTS IN COMMERCIAL AND
INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The following requirements are intended to provide for attractive,
compatible, and aesthetic commercial and industrial area development. The city
has determined that aesthetic development encourages the safeguarding of
property values, the protection of public and private investments and the
promotion of high-quality development.
   (A)   Commercial zoning designations. All commercial buildings shall be
constructed according to the following minimum requirements:
      (1)   All walls shall contain a façade with 80% of wall area, excluding
doors and windows, being masonry materials that includes brick, slump-faced or
decorative concrete masonry unit, rock, stone or stucco or like material,
concrete (poured in place, pre-cast or tilt-wall) with aggregate, sandblasted
or textured coating finish, or other structural material of equal durability
and architectural effect. Smooth faced concrete masonry unit (CMU), except as
accent to approved finish material, shall not be installed on any façade. Other
materials such as exposed exterior metal walls, untreated concrete block,
painted concrete block, or unfinished, untreated concrete panels are not
permitted and shall not be installed on any façade of any building. See
division (A)(2) below for procedure for variation or approval of other finish
materials.
      (2)   Requests for exceptions or variations to the building material
requirements of this division (A) may be presented to and considered by the
Planning Commission, which will then make recommendations to the City Council.
The City Council, upon the advice from the Planning Commission, shall consider,
approve, or deny the request. Factors to be considered and evaluated shall not
be limited to, but shall include, the specific provisions of the request, the
effect of the exception or variation on the overall and local community
appearance, the potential impact on the community quality of life, the
applicability of the exceptions or variation to the specific structure (for
example public auditorium or school gymnasiums of the type being constructed
during the 2004 calendar year by the city’s public school system), the economic
impact on the community as a whole, adjacent zoning districts, present
adjoining uses, and potential future uses of surrounding property.
   (B)   Industrial zoning designations. All industrial buildings shall be
constructed according to the following requirements:
      (1)   Any wall(s) facing a street shall contain a façade with at least

         (c)   The Board of Adjustment shall keep minutes of its proceedings,
showing the vote, indicating the fact, and shall keep records of its

         (d)   The minutes of the meeting at which a variance or special
exception is reviewed shall show that each required element for necessary for
evaluation of the variance or special exception request was considered at the
public hearing on the question and entered into the record.
      (2)   The concurring vote of three members of the Board of Adjustment
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination
of any administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any
matter upon which it is required to pass under any ordinance, or to effect any
variation in the ordinance.
   (C)   Powers and duties. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following
powers:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative
official in the interpretation or enforcement of this chapter;
      (2)   Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of
a specific piece of property at the time or the original adoption of the
regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of
property, the strict application of this chapter would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional or undue hardship upon the
owner of the property, the Board of Adjustment is hereby empowered to
authorize, upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from the strict
application so as to relieve the difficulties of hardship, but may establish
the requirements relative to the property as would carry out the purpose and
intent of this chapter;
      (3)   Upon appeal, the Board of Adjustment is empowered to permit the
following exceptions:
         (a)   To permit line extension of a zoning district where the boundary
line of a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown of record;
         (b)   To interpret the provisions of this chapter where the street
layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the
zoning map fixing the several district, which map is made a part of this
chapter; and
         (c)   To consider granting relief through a special exception from an
encroachment of a structure into a required setback area where the property
owner alleges there was an error in the survey, the title information, or a
contractor’s error that resulted in the violation of a zoning district setback
line by a permanent structure.
      (4)   Upon application the Board of Adjustment is empowered to grant
special exceptions. The special exception is intended to allow the location of
certain uses while maintaining adequate protection of the surrounding area.
These uses, while not generally conforming with traditional use groupings in
specific zoning districts, may, when consideration is given to sitting,
physical features, compatibility with surrounding land uses, traffic patterns
and aesthetics, be able to locate in an area where they will be compatible with
existing or planned uses. Each case shall be reviewed on its own merits by the
Board of Adjustment which may authorize it by granting a special exception.
   (D)   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected
by any decision of the Building Inspector or City Council related to this
chapter. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days from the date of the decision
by filing with the City Clerk a notice of appeal specifying the grounds
thereof, and paying a filing fee of $100 for either a variance, special
exception or other type of application, at the office of the City Clerk at the
time the notice is filed.
      (2)   The City Clerk shall transmit to the Chairperson of the Board of
Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the City Clerk certifies to the Board of
Adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with the Clerk, that by
reason of facts stated in the certification, a stay would, in the Clerk’s
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.
      (3)   In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a
court of record on application and notice to the City Clerk and on the cause
shown.
      (4)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of the appeal, giving public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the
parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time, at the
hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   (E)   Individual special exceptions authorized. In addition to the uses
permitted by right, conditionally or on review in each zoning district, the
Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception to authorize the following
additional uses after an application has been made and a public hearing held in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   A mobile home or manufactured house for temporary use on a lot that
is already occupied by one principal structure to be permitted only if the
applicant submits proof of a medical hardship which necessitates the temporary
location, the hardship shall include serious illness or the other medical
hardship as the Board may consider and accept. The use of a mobile home or
manufactured house for such temporary use shall only be permitted on property
within an “A”, “E-1”, “E-2” or “R-F-l” District, according to the Official
Zoning Districts Map.
      (2)   Upon consideration of all pertinent information, a special
exception may be granted by the Board of Adjustment to authorize any of the
above enumerated uses in individual zoning districts so long as the spirit and
intent of the chapter is not jeopardized and all requirements hereof are
satisfied.
      (3)   An application for a special exception shall be filed by the owner
of the site or the owner’s agent in accordance with procedures as set forth in
this chapter.
      (4)   All applicable off-street parking, intensity of use, screening,
coverage, height, area and setback provisions for the zoning district in which
the use is proposed shall be the minimum requirements for the development of
any special exception use. However, the Board of Adjustment may impose any
additional requirements that it deems necessary in order to protect the public
interest, the additional requirements shall be complied with as a condition to
the establishment of any use and shall be maintained as a condition to the
continuance of the use.
      (5)   A complete site plan, drawn to an accurate and acceptable scale,
shall be filed with each application for a special exception. The site plan
shall include at a minimum:
         (a)   The location and area of the main and accessory buildings on the
site and in relationship to each other and to adjacent uses;
         (b)   The number and arrangement of parking spaces, traffic
circulation areas, the adequacy and manner of the lighting thereof, and its
effect on surrounding properties;
         (c)   The relationship between the off-street parking areas and points
of ingress and egress, and the traffic circulation both within and without the

facilities;

disposal of garbage and trash;

manufactured house for a temporary residence:

time period at the Board’s discretion, not to exceed three years. Unless the
applicant shall file an application for extension of the special exception at
least 60 days prior to the expiration of the special exception, the use shall
terminate at the end of the period. In the event an application to continue the
special exception use is timely filed, the Board shall determine if the need
that led to the granting of the original special exception is still present and
if there has been any material change of conditions relevant to the granting of
the special exception. In the event an extension is granted, it shall be for a
period not to exceed three years.
         (b)   If the hardship that led to the granting of the special
exception ceases to exist prior to the expiration date established by the
Board’s order, the mobile home or manufactured house shall be removed within 60
days of the date that the hardship ceases to exist.
      (7)   Conditions for approval.
         (a)   The principal for whom the special exception is requested shall
be a relative by blood or marriage.

caused by the applicant. Such medical hardship shall be documented by written
medical reports.
         (c)   Only one mobile home shall be allowed accessory to a permanent

§ 155.36 ADDITIONAL HEIGHT SIGNAGE OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   General. An additional height signage overlay district providing for
and allowing additional height for accessory, commercial, non-accessory and
billboard signs located within the additional height overlay district as a “use
on review” to accommodate the signage needs in areas adjacent to and near
interstate, controlled access highways all pursuant to the following provisions
upon review by the Planning Commission and a finding of:
      (1)   The need for the additional height requested;
      (2)   That the placement in relation to the roadway frontage is
appropriate; and
      (3)   That the impact of the proposed drainage on other signage in the
district, existing and anticipated, will be compatible and complementary to the
area and the city the use under these provisions may be recommended to the City
Council for approval as “use on review”. Such signs shall conform to the
following.
         (a)   Allowable maximum sign height within the district shall be 100
feet.
         (b)   All overheight non-accessory and billboard signage in an overlay
district shall be restricted to advertising businesses located in the overlay
district.
         (c)   All other provisions of the ordinances of the city shall remain
applicable to all signage within an overlay district.
   (B)   District boundaries.
      (1)   I-35 - Highway 9 additional height signage overlay district.

         (b)   North from Highway 9 along city street, Harvey Street, for a
width measured from the I-35 right-of-way to a point 100 feet west of the
centerline of Harvey Street.
      (2)   I-44 - Highway 37 additional height signage overlay district.
         (a)   From the I-44 intersection and off- ramp west to a point 330

            1.   For that portion north of North 24th Street, a width of 150
feet measured from the centerline of the access road right-of-way on either
side of I-44 and Highway 62. This measurement description is in anticipation of
a west side frontage road right-of-way of 80 feet being acquired by the city
and such being equivalent to an overlay width of 230 feet from the existing I-
44 right-of-way on the west and from the centerline of Highway 62 on the east.
            2.   For that portion lying south of North 24th Street, the east

§ 156.01 SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “City of Newcastle
Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance.”
   (B)   The City Council has the authority to adopt this chapter pursuant to
police powers granted to municipalities of the state and specifically by 11
O.S. §§ 11-101 and 43-103.
   (C)   This chapter shall apply within the corporate limits of the city to
any person seeking the issuance of a building permit for any commercial,
industrial or residential development which requires the recording of a final
plat pursuant to the subdivision regulations of the city.
(Ord. 813, passed 6-26-2018)
§ 156.02 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The city finds, determines and declares that:
   (A)   The city must expand its transportation system in order to maintain
current levels of service if new development is to be accommodated.
   (B)   The legislature of the state has, through the enablement of land
development statutes and police power regulations authorized municipalities to
adopt a transportation impact fee ordinance.
   (C)   The imposition of impact fees is one of the preferred methods of
ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the costs of capital
facilities necessary to accommodate such development which is required to
promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens and
residents of municipalities.
   (D)   Land development will generate traffic demands necessitating either
the acquisition of land or the construction of facilities and improvements
necessitated by new developments for which the fees are to be levied.
   (E)   The fees established in this chapter are derived from, are based upon,
and do not exceed, the costs of providing new capacity, acquiring additional
land, and/or construction of improvements necessitated by the new developments
for which the fees are to be levied.
(Ord. 813, passed 6-26-2018)
§ 156.03 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.

      (6)   The word “person” includes an individual, a corporation, a
partnership, a limited partnership, an incorporated association or any other
similar entity.
      (7)   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a
regulation involves two or more items, conditions, provisions, or events
connected by the conjunction “and,” “or,” “either or”, the conjunction shall be
interpreted as follows:
         (a)   “And” indicates that all the connected terms, conditions,
provisions or events apply.
