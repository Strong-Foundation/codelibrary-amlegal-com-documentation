nature as to constitute a grave and immediate danger to the peace, health,
safety, morals or welfare of one or more persons or of the public generally. It
is recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to
require, the mayor or other appropriate officer or agency of the city
government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such
nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can
be taken toward such abatement. (1987 Code § 8-308)
   B.   Request For Abatement: The chief of the fire department, the chief of
police, the city attorney and the building inspector, or any other officer
subordinate to the mayor may submit, through or with the consent of the mayor
to the city council, a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined

be abated. The mayor himself, the health officer, any council member, or any
resident or residents of the city may submit such a statement and request a
recommendation to the city council. (1987 Code § 8-308; amd. 2004 Code)
   C.   Determination Of Nuisance; Notice; Hearing: The city council shall
determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the
purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the city council shall have power
to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects. Before
proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the city council shall give
notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property
concerned, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and
opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the owner and other
persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by a police
officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names or addresses
are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person
or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the
necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of
general circulation within the city.
   D.   Abatement By City; Assessment Of Costs: If the city council finds that
a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall direct the owner or other persons
responsible for, or causing, the nuisance to abate it within a specified time
if the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person or persons or
public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent
delay, or if the owner or other persons responsible for, or causing, the
nuisance do not abate it within the specified time, the city council shall
direct the mayor to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary
abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 16. The
city clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the
owner or other persons responsible for, or causing, the nuisance, as may be
just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are known. Until
paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city collectible as other debts
of the city may be collected. (1987 Code § 8-308)

juvenile relationship or the parental right to raise children or juveniles.

or domesticated animal when the animal, without undue provocation, bites him or
another person or domesticated animal, or attacks, or attempts to bite or

ordinarily prudent person would be led to believe that the person or animal
toward whom the efforts of the animal are directed is about to be bitten or
otherwise physically harmed. (Ord. 2011-14, 4-28-2011)
5-6-6: KEEPING OF RABID OR VICIOUS/DANGEROUS ANIMALS:
   A.   No person or other entity shall own or harbor any rabid or vicious/
dangerous animal within the city, unless the same is kept upon private premises
of such person or entity and securely locked within a sufficient enclosure to
prevent any possible means of escape. For a secure enclosure to be sufficient,
it must be constructed with four (4) sides, a top, a bottom and a locked gate
of sufficient materials, not including soil, to prevent any possible means of
escape. Any vicious/dangerous animal running at large on the streets or alleys,
or other public ways, of the city shall be immediately removed and impounded,
or terminated when deemed necessary by the animal control officer or other
authorized city employee, to protect public safety when the situation warrants,
regardless of whether or not such animal has a collar and tag or muzzle. Any
leash, tether, chain, rope or other device used to control a vicious/dangerous
animal when an animal is taken off personal property shall not exceed six feet
(6') in length without such animal being constituted running at large. Other
officers of the law may likewise, when deemed necessary to protect the public
safety, remove, impound or terminate a vicious/dangerous animal when the
situation warrants. Any animal deemed vicious/dangerous by the city court may
be terminated by euthanasia with the consent of the owner or keeper of such
animal, or upon the order of the municipal judge.
   B.   It shall be the duty of the animal control officer or other designated
city employee or official to investigate any proper claim that an animal is
vicious/dangerous within the meaning of this chapter. Should the investigating
official determine that a vicious/dangerous animal poses an immediate threat to
the public health or safety, he shall immediately seize and impound the animal.
If the owner or keeper of such animal disputes the finding of the animal
control officer or other designated official, the investigating officer shall
also refer the matter to the city attorney for filing of a verified complaint
requesting a finding by the court that the impounded animal is vicious/
dangerous and aid in the proceedings instituted in the municipal criminal court
against any person for harboring a vicious/dangerous animal. The fact that the
owner or keeper of such animal disputes the determination of the animal control
officer shall not prevent or delay the impoundment of the animal.
   C.   If the court shall fail to find, upon a preponderance of the evidence
presented in an evidentiary hearing, that the animal seized and impounded is a
vicious/dangerous animal, then the court shall order the animal control officer
to return the animal to its owner. If such animal is found by the municipal
court to be a vicious/dangerous animal, the court shall order the animal
control officer to euthanize the animal, or direct the owner of such animal to
take such steps as are reasonably necessary to protect the public health and
safety.
   D.   At the option of the owner, but subject to the approval of the animal
control officer, an animal impounded pursuant to this section may be impounded
in a private kennel or veterinary clinic during the pendency of the vicious/
dangerous animal action. The operators of the facility shall then assume full
liability for the confinement and maintenance of such animal and shall not
release it without it first being authorized by the animal control officer or
the court. All fees for such impoundment shall be the responsibility of the
owner. In no event shall the city be liable for costs or fees charged by the
private facility. Further, the court may assess the owner the cost of
transporting the animal to the privately operated impoundment facility.
   E.   A violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine of two
hundred dollars ($200.00), plus court costs, or such other amount as shall be
established, from time to time, by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2014-

an epidemic of rabies threatens the city, the city council, by resolution, may
order all dogs to be muzzled when at large within the city, and if deemed
desirable, all cats to be confined, during a period of time to be determined by
the city council. Such resolution or an adequate notice of its passage shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city and shall go
into effect on the date following such publication unless the resolution
prescribes a later time.
   B.   Dogs Or Cats At Large Prohibited: While such resolution is in effect,

granted or protected by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the
subject of the complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing
practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent

statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of
the investigation; provided, however, that the mayor first complies with the
provisions of the fourth amendment relating to unreasonable searches and
seizures. The mayor may issue subpoenas to compel his access to, or the
production of, such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court for the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The mayor may administer
oaths.
   B.   Issuance Of Subpoenas: Upon written application to the mayor, a
respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of
subpoenas by, and in the name of, the mayor himself. Subpoenas issued at the
request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and address of such
respondent and shall state that they were issued at his request.

that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or
place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any
matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   E.   Petition For Enforcement: In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a
subpoena, the mayor or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which

or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report,
account, record, or other document submitted to the mayor pursuant to his
subpoena or other order, or shall wilfully neglect or fail to make or cause to
be made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or

eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred;
provided, however, that the court shall continue such use brought pursuant to
this section or subsection
5-7-10D of this chapter from time to time before bringing it to trial if the
court believes that the conciliation efforts of the mayor are likely to result
in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of
in the complaint made to the mayor and which practice forms the basis for the
action in court; and provided, however, that any sale, encumbrance, or rental
consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the authority
of this chapter, and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant
without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil
action under the provision of this chapter, shall not be affected. (Ord. 1992-

if required for safety to stop shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection before entering the intersection; if there is no
crosswalk, the driver shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if there is

indication to proceed. (1987 Code § 15-553)
6-4-38: FAILURE TO DIM LIGHTS TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC:
   A.   Whenever a driver of a vehicle approaches an oncoming vehicle within
five hundred feet (500'), such driver shall use a distribution of light, or
composite beam, so aimed that the glaring rays are not projected into the eyes
of the oncoming driver. The lowermost distribution of light, or composite beam,
specified in paragraph 1 of section 12-203.2, title 47, motor vehicles, shall

in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 2019-04, 5-8-2019, eff. 5-8-2019)

   A.   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2019-04, 5-8-2019, eff. 5-8-2019)

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either: a) any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or
Safety Code specifications which have been identified by the local Code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions or b) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
VARIANCE: Means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National
Flood Insurance Program Regulations.)
VIOLATION: Means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,

   E.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection
10-3-14B of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   G.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (section
10-3-3 of this chapter).
   H.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   I.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   J.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon: a) showing a good and
sufficient cause; b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and c) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   K.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that: a) the criteria outlined in
subsections A through I of this section are met, and b) the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety. (Ord. 2019-04, 5-8-
2019, eff. 5-8-2019)

eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 2019-04, 5-8-2019, eff. 5-8-2019)
10-3-19: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
   A.   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
10-3-7 of this chapter, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one foot (1') to
three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at or above the
base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the
depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no
depth number is specified).
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures;
         a.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at or above
the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the
depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no
depth number is specified), or
         b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
designed so that below the base specified flood depth level in an AO Zone, or
below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
      3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in section
10-3-14 of this chapter are satisfied.
      4.   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures. (Ord. 2019-04, 5-8-2019, eff. 5-8-2019)
10-3-20: FLOODWAYS:
   A.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
section
10-3-7 of this chapter, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      1.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of sections
10-3-16,
10-3-17,
10-3-18, and
10-3-19 of this chapter and this section.
      3.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit
encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes
all of the provisions required by section 65.12. (Ord. 2019-04, 5-8-2019, eff.
5-8-2019)

a stormwater drainage system would:
   A.   Reduce flood and storm losses and inconveniences from uncontrolled
stormwater runoff in the city;
   B.   Improve conditions so that the movement of emergency vehicles is
neither prohibited nor inhibited during storm or flood periods; and
   C.   Preserve and improve the city's watercourses, improve and preserve
water quality, minimize water quality degradation and otherwise facilitate
water resource management techniques, including the reduction of pollution and
the enhancement of the urban environment and such other requirements of the
city, state and federal governments. (Ord. 2011-27, 12-20-2011)
10-4-2: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FUND ESTABLISHMENT; FUNDING:
   A.   In the event the city determines to impose a stormwater fee, the
stormwater management fund is hereby established to receive all of the
stormwater charges collected for the use of the city's stormwater drainage
system and to meet applicable local, state and federal regulations. The fund
shall be maintained for the purpose of identifying and controlling all revenues
and expenses attributable to the stormwater charge. All of the stormwater
charges collected and all loans, grants or funds received for the
administration, operation, construction and improvement of the stormwater
drainage system shall be deposited into the fund. The fund shall be used to pay
for costs of data collection, planning, designing, engineering, policing,
constructing, maintaining, operating and improving drainage services and
facilities and any other activity provided for by this chapter.
   B.   Expenditures and disbursements from the fund shall be at the direction

The determination of stormwater services to be provided, and stormwater
facilities and improvements to be constructed will be made at the sole
discretion of the city council. The manager shall recommend the provision of
stormwater services and construction, repair or replacement of stormwater
facilities and improvements to the city council based upon engineering
analyses, taking into consideration frequency of flooding events, potential
loss of life, potential property damage, potential effect upon the general
public and any other factor affecting the purpose of this chapter. (Ord. 2011-
27, 12-20-2011)
10-4-6: CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT:
   A.   All new utility, industrial, commercial, institutional and multi-family
residential facilities and all residential subdivisions shall obtain a
construction stormwater discharge permit prior to construction activity. The
construction stormwater discharge permit shall be required in addition to any
permits required by the state or elsewhere in this code for stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity or for stormwater discharges
associated with construction activity or land disturbing activity.
   B.   The minimum standards for issuance of a construction stormwater
discharge permit shall be a pollution prevention plan, and either an approved
general OPDES permit or a land disturbing permit. The application for a
construction stormwater discharge permit shall be filed with the manager and
shall:
      1.   Include, if the facility is to be covered under a DEQ OPDES permit
for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, a general OPDES
permit, an industrial OPDES permit or an NOI, copies of such documents;
      2.   Demonstrate how the owner/operator or developer will ensure that
postdevelopment off site discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates;
      3.   Unless otherwise specified, include calculations of off site
discharges for the existing and developed conditions computed using the 100-
year return frequency storm and soil conservation service (SCS type II) design;
      4.   Contain plans for facilities that serve an area with ten (10) or
more disturbed acres designed to capture the design storm in a detention or
retention basin providing three thousand six hundred (3,600) cubic feet of
storage per acre drained to reduce the "first flush" pollutant load. Where
providing three thousand six hundred (3,600) cubic feet of storage per acre
drained is not attainable, small sediment basins of equivalent total volume
shall be used;
      5.   Include detention or retention ponds that shall have at least one
foot (1') of freeboard above the design storm, provide a paved emergency
overflow and the maximum level in the pond to be one foot (1') below any
finished floor level of the facility. Ponds shall also have permanent vehicle
access for maintenance purposes. A plan for the routine maintenance of the
ponds will be incorporated in the pollution prevention plan;
      6.   Include constructed wetlands if used to deal with the "first flush"
pollutant load instead of the pond of three thousand six hundred (3,600) cubic
feet per acre storage. Grit trap and oil separators must be installed upstream
of the wetlands to prevent contamination;
      7.   Include in the pollution prevention plan a demonstration of how the
facility will collect, control and treat stormwater so as to control the
quantity and quality of stormwater leaving the site. The plan shall also
include, as necessary, structural controls and nonstructural best management
practices adequate to prevent the violation of any water quality standard, and
shall meet the provisions of the clean water act (best conventional technology
and best available technology treatment requirements).
      8.   The pollution prevention plan must be reviewed and approved by the
manager prior to the issuance of a construction stormwater discharge permit.
      9.   The manager must receive an NOI or a certificate of occupancy for
the facility or subdivision for a final inspection. (Ord. 2011-27, 12-20-2011)

discharge permit or land disturbing permit shall be made available for the
manager's review at any time. The owner/operator shall send a permit renewal
request annually to the manager prior to the anniversary date of the permit.
(Ord. 2011-27, 12-20-2011)
10-4-9: TRANSFER OF PERMIT:
An industrial or construction stormwater discharge permit or land disturbing
permit may be transferred to a subsequent owner/operator only upon the filing
of an amended application containing all of the subsequent owner/operator's
information required on an application providing there are no changes in the
operation of the facility which may affect the quantity or quality of the
stormwater runoff. If there are to be any changes in the operation of the
facility which may affect the quantity or quality of stormwater runoff, then
the subsequent owner/operator shall resubmit, by NOI, for a stormwater
discharge permit or land disturbing permit prior to the beginning of operation
of the facility. The filing of an amended application shall be treated as an
interim permit allowing the continued operation of the facility pending review
of the amended application by the manager, which shall remain in force until
the amended application shall be approved or denied by the manager. (Ord. 2011-
27, 12-20-2011)
10-4-10: LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY REGULATED:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct, or permit to be
conducted, any land disturbing activity upon any land without a land disturbing
permit issued under this chapter and a general OPDES permit, with a copy
provided to the manager. Such permit shall be required in addition to any
building permit or other permit required by this code for the site and shall be
available for inspection by the manager on the job site at all times during
which land disturbing activities are in progress. The phrase "land disturbing
activity" shall not include the following:
      1.   Such minor land disturbing activities as home gardens and individual
home landscaping, home repairs, home maintenance work and other related
activities which result in minor soil erosion;
      2.   The construction of single-family residences when built separately
on lots less than five (5) acres not within a subdivision and have been issued
building permits; provided that excavation is limited to trenches for the
foundation, basements, service and sanitary sewer connections, and minor
grading for driveways, yard areas and sidewalks, with no off site discharge of
pollutants;
      3.   Individual service and sanitary sewer connections for single- or
two-family residences;
      4.   Agricultural practices involving the establishment, cultivation or
harvesting of products of the field or orchard, preparing and planting of
pastureland, forestry land management practices including harvesting, farm
ponds, dairy operations and livestock and poultry management practices, and the
construction of farm buildings;
      5.   Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the soil
conservation service of the United States department of agriculture;
      6.   Installation, maintenance and repair of any underground public
utility lines when such activity occurs on an existing hard surface road,
street or sidewalk, provided the activity maintains pollution control and is
confined to the area of the road, street or sidewalk which is hard surfaced and
a street, curb, gutter or sidewalk permit has been obtained; and
      7.   Construction, repair or rebuilding of tracks of a railroad company.
These activities may be undertaken without the required permits; however, the
persons conducting these excluded activities shall remain responsible for
conducting these activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
and other applicable laws including responsibility for controlling
sedimentation and runoff both during the land disturbing activity and after the
land disturbing activity is complete.
   B.   The minimum standards for controlling erosion and sedimentation from
land disturbing activities shall be set forth in rules or regulations as
adopted and amended from time to time by resolution approved by the city
council. A copy of the rules and regulations shall be maintained in the office
of the city clerk and may be viewed and copied in accordance with the
provisions of this code. (Ord. 2011-27, 12-20-2011)
10-4-11: SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL:
No land disturbing activity shall be conducted within the city except in such a
manner that:
   A.   Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities
shall be conducted so as to minimize erosion. Clearing and grubbing must be
held to the minimum necessary for grading and equipment operation.
Preconstruction vegetative ground cover shall not be destroyed, removed or
disturbed more than ten (10) days prior to grading or earthmoving. Construction
must be sequenced to minimize the exposure time of cleared surface area;
   B.   Upon completion of land disturbing activities, will not leave slopes so
that they will erode. Such methods shall include revegetation, sodding,
mulching, riprapping or guniting. Regardless of the method used, the objective
will be to leave the site as erosion free and maintenance free as practicable;
   C.   Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and
supplemented;
   D.   Permanent or temporary soil stabilization is applied to disturbed areas
to the extent feasible within seven (7) days on areas that will remain
unfinished for more than fourteen (14) days. Permanent soil stabilization with
perennial vegetation shall be applied as soon as practicable after final
grading is reached on any portion of the site. Soil stabilization refers to
measures that protect soil from the erosive forces of wind, raindrop impact and
flowing water, and includes the growing of grass, sod, application of straw,
mulch, fabric mats, and the early application of gravel base on areas to be
paved;
   E.   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on disturbed areas
not otherwise permanently stabilized;
   F.   Sediment in stormwater runoff is trapped by the use of debris basins,
sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures, but not hay bales, until the
disturbed area is stabilized;
   G.   Neighboring persons and property are protected from damage or loss
resulting from excessive stormwater runoff, soil erosion or deposition upon
property or public streets of water transported silt and debris. Adjacent
property owners shall be protected from land devaluation due to exposed bare
banks;
   H.   A controlled construction entrance/exit is maintained in a condition
that will prevent tracking or flowing of sediment onto the public right of way;
   I.   Erosion and sediment control measures must be in place and functional
before earthmoving operations begin, and must be constructed and maintained
throughout the construction period. Temporary measures may be removed at the
beginning of the workday, but must be replaced at the end of the workday;
   J.   Structural controls shall be designed and maintained as required to
prevent pollution. All surface water flowing toward the construction area
shall, to the extent practicable, be diverted by using berms, channels or
sediment traps as necessary. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be
designed according to the size and slope of disturbed or drainage areas to
detain stormwater runoff and trap sediment. Discharges from sediment basins and
traps must be through a pipe or lined channel so that the discharge does not
cause erosion. Muddy water to be pumped from excavation and work areas must be
held in settling basins or treated by filtration prior to its discharge into
surface waters where practicable. Waters must be discharged through a pipe or
lined channel so that the discharge does not cause erosion and sedimentation;
   K.   All control measures are inspected, and repaired as necessary, biweekly
in dry periods and within twenty four (24) hours after any precipitation of
one-half inch (0.5") or more within a twenty four (24) hour period. During
prolonged precipitation, daily inspections and repairing must be performed. The
permittee shall maintain records of such inspections and repairs;
   L.   A specific individual is designated to be responsible for erosion and
sediment controls on each site;
   M.   There shall be no distinctly visible floating scum, oil or other matter
contained in the stormwater discharge. The stormwater discharge must not cause
an objectionable color contrast in the receiving water. The stormwater
discharge must result in no materials in concentrations sufficient to be
hazardous or otherwise detrimental to humans, livestock, wildlife, plant life
or fish and aquatic life in the receiving stream; and
   N.   When the land disturbing activity is finished and stable, perennial
vegetation has been established on all remaining exposed soil. The permittee
shall notify the manager of these facts and submit an NOI of the permit issued
under this section. The manager shall then provide a final inspection of the
site within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice and, when advisable,
may require additional measures to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. If
such requirements are given by letter, the permittee shall continue to be
covered by the provisions of this chapter until a request for termination of
the permit has been accepted by the manager. (Ord. 2011-27, 12-20-2011)
10-4-12: UNAUTHORIZED DISCHARGES A PUBLIC NUISANCE:
Discharge of stormwater in any manner in violation of this chapter or of any
condition of a permit issued pursuant to this chapter or a stormwater discharge
permit issued by the state is hereby declared a public nuisance and must be
corrected or abated by the owner/operator. (Ord. 2011-27, 12-20-2011)
10-4-13: ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL DUMPING:
   A.   The following direct or indirect discharges into community waters or
waters of the state are prohibited and shall be unlawful:

council upon the recommendation of the planning commission following the
submission of an application for such development by the applicant in such
cases where the application will provide a development that will be in harmony
with the character of the neighborhood, will ensure a density of land use no
higher and a standard of open space at least as high as required by this title
in the district in which the proposed project is to be located. In no case
shall a use or building height or density of population be permitted which is
less than the requirements of the district in which the housing project is to
be located. (1987 Code § 12-238)
11-8-10: SPECIAL USE PERMITS; REVIEW; COMMUNICATION SERVICES:
The uses listed under the various districts herein as special permit uses are
so classified because they more intensely dominate the area in which they are
located than do other uses permitted in the district; however, the nature of
such uses make it desirable that they may be permitted to locate therein. The
following procedure is established to integrate property into special permit
uses with other land uses located in the district:
   A.   Review Process; Notice; Hearing: These uses shall be reviewed and
authorized or rejected under the following procedures:
      1.   An application shall be filed with the city planning commission for
review. The application shall show the location or intended use of the site,
the names of all the property owners and existing land uses within three
hundred feet (300') and any other material or information pertinent to the
request which the planning commission may require.
      2.   Notice shall be published and mailed to property owners at least
seven (7) days before the hearing.
      3.   The planning commission shall hold one or more public hearings
thereon.
      4.   The planning commission shall, within forty five (45) days of the
date of the application, transmit to the city council its report as to the
effect of such proposed building or use upon the character of the neighborhood,
traffic conditions, public utilities, and other matters pertaining to the
general welfare, and the recommendation of the planning commission concerning
the use thereon. Thereupon, the city council may authorize or deny the issuance
of a permit for the use of land or buildings as requested.
   B.   Filing Fee: Fees for the filing of a special use permit application
shall be set by motion or resolution of the city council.
   C.   Communication Services; Towers; Cellular Telephone, Radio And
Television: The following criteria are established for each use subject to
review before issuance of a special permit:
      1.   Districts: Eligible in A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3, industrial.
      2.   Height And Anchors:
         a.   Any tower anchored to the ground which is proposed to extend to a
height of over fifty feet (50').
         b.   Any tower attached to a building which is proposed to reach a
height over twenty feet (20') above the roofline of the building.
      3.   Standards For Ground Anchored Towers:
         a.   Towers and antennas shall be located on a site so as to provide a
minimum distance equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the height of the
tower from all property lines; provided, however, that the council may modify
this requirement where tower design will assure that a collapsing tower will
fall within a smaller area.
         b.   All tower supports and peripheral anchors shall be located
entirely within the boundaries of the property and shall not be less than five
feet (5') from the property line.
         c.   A wall or chainlink fence not less than eight feet (8') in height
from finished grade shall be provided around any high voltage equipment.
            (1)   Access shall be through a locked gate;
            (2)   Signs shall be located every twenty feet (20'), attached to
the fence or wall, and shall display in large bold letters the following:
   HIGH VOLTAGE - DANGER
         d.   Equipment, mobile or immobile, that is not necessary for direct
support of the use, shall not be stored or parked on the site unless repairs to
the facility are being made, or unless the zoning district permits such a use.

Within the districts established by this title or amendments that may later be
adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which
were lawful before the regulations of this title were passed or amended but
which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this
title or future amendments. It is the intent of this title to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. Such uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this
title that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended,
nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere
in the same district. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use
of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended
or enlarged after adoption of this title. (1987 Code § 12-240)
11-10-2: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
In any district in which a lot exists of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this title which does not conform in size or area to
the provisions of this title, buildings for the uses permitted in such district
may be erected on such lot, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this title; provided, that such lot is in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. (1987 Code §
12-241)
11-10-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this title that could not be built under the terms of this title by reason
of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics
of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Enlargement Or Alteration: No such structure may be enlarged or altered
in a way which increases its nonconformity.
   B.   Destruction; Reconstruction: Should such structure be destroyed by any
means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at
time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except in conformity with
the provisions of this title.
   C.   Moving Structure: Should such structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved. (1987 Code § 12-242)
11-10-4: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES:
If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title that would
not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title, the lawful use
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
   A.   Changing To Permitted Use: No existing structure devoted to a use not
permitted by this title in the district in which it is located shall be
enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered,
except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district
in which it is located.
   B.   Extending: Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts
of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment of this title, but no such use shall be extended
to occupy any land outside such building.
   C.   Conformance With District Regulations: Any structure, or structure and
land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a
permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
   D.   Discontinuance Or Abandonment: When a nonconforming use of a structure,
or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six
(6) consecutive months, the structure, or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used, except in conformance with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   E.   Removal Or Destruction: Where nonconforming use status applies to a
structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. (1987 Code § 12-243)
11-10-5: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND:
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title, lawful
uses of land exist that are no longer permissible under the terms of this title
as enacted or amended, such uses may be continued so long as they remain
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Moving: No such conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this title.
   B.   Enlargement: No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased
or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this title.
   C.   Discontinuance: If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of such
land shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district
in which such land is located. (1987 Code § 12-244)
11-10-6: CHANGES IN NONCONFORMITY:
A nonconforming use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination,
shall not be changed unless changed to a use permitted in the district in which
located, except that the board of adjustment may permit a change to a more
restricted nonconforming use and such change shall be construed as an
abandonment of the former permitted nonconforming use. (1987 Code § 12-245)

SPECIFIC USE PERMITS
SECTION:

11-12-2: Conditions For Approval
11-12-3: Specific Use Permit List
11-12-4: Use Conditions
11-12-5: Administration
11-12-1: PURPOSES:
   A.   The City Council may, after a public hearing and recommendation by the
Planning Commission, authorize for specific parcels of land, the issuance of a
Specific Use Permit.
   B.   The uses listed in the Specific Use List located in
11-12-3, as well as other uses outlined in the McLoud Municipal Code as
requiring a Specific Use Permit, are so classified because of the size of the
land they require or the specialized nature of the use, they may more intensely
dominate the area in which they are located, or their effects on the general
public are broader in scope than other types of uses permitted in the district.
   C.   The designation of a Specific Use Permit as possible on the Specific
Use Permit List does not constitute an authorization or an assurance that such
use will be permitted. Rather, each Specific Use Permit application shall be
valued as to its probable effect on the adjacent property and community welfare
and may be approved or denied, with appropriate conditions, as the findings
indicate appropriate. (Ord. 2019-10, 11-12-2019)

requirements necessary for consideration of the application. The Commission
shall also set a deposit amount from the applicant sufficient for payment of
the application and permit expenses. The requirements and amount of deposit may
be adjusted by the Planning Commission as necessary during the application
process. The Planning Commission may require that the applicant furnish
preliminary site plans and data concerning the operation, location, function
and characteristics of any use of land or building proposed. For uses in which
the land use has possible environmental impact, the Commission may require
those engineering and/or environmental impact studies necessary for the City of
McLoud evaluation of the proposed use. Further, the Commission may require such
other information as necessary to evaluate the proposed specific use.
   B.   Planning Commission Requirements - The Planning Commission may, in the
interest of the public welfare and to assure compliance with the intent of this
ordinance and the McLoud Comprehensive Plan, require such development standards
and operational conditions and safeguards as are indicated to be important to
the welfare and protection of adjacent property and the community as a whole
and be compatible with the natural environment and the planned capacities of
public services and facilities affected by the land use. This may include the
requirement of having the property platted and/or the requirement of the
dedication of sufficient right-of-way or easement as necessary to further the
public good. The Planning Commission may recommend the City Council impose
certain safeguards and conditions including, but not limited to: bonding,
insurance, permitted uses, lot sizes, setbacks, height limits, required
facilities, buffers, open space areas, lighting, noise levels, signage,
landscaping, parking and loading, compatibility, ingress and egress, off-street
parking and loading arrangements, location or construction of buildings and
uses, and land use intensity/density as may be required depending upon the
proposed use and its potential effect on adjacent areas or the community. If
the Planning Commission fails to review and make a recommendation within 90
days from the date the application is accepted for processing, the City Council
may take action on the application.
   C.   City Council Requirements - The City Council shall have the same
authority as the Planning Commission under subsection B, and in addition may

provisions of this Zoning Code shall not be considered as an amendment to the
zoning ordinance; however, the Specific Use Permit shall be noted on the zoning
map as follows: SUP - (the number of the request for a Specific Use Permit).
Any of the conditions contained in a Specific Use Permit approval shall be
considered as conditions precedent to the granting of a Building Permit for the
specific use provided for.
   F.   Time Limits for Implementation - If for any reason the approved
specific use ceases operation for a period of two years, then the approval of
said specific use shall be considered void and will require another public
hearing review by the Planning Commission and City Council. This shall also
apply to any approved specific use that does not begin operation within two
years of approval. This voiding of approval shall not apply if orderly progress
toward completion of construction is taking place. Uses existing before the
adoption of the Specific Use Permit ordinance, including nonconforming uses and
their incidental and accessory uses, must receive a Specific Use Permit before
any expansion of the use is permitted or the municipality may act or approve

12-4-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The intent of the planned unit development (PUD) regulations is to
permit greater flexibility and consequently more creative and imaginative
design than generally are possible under conventional zoning regulations.
   B.   It is hereby intended to permit, upon application and upon approval of
site and use plans, the creation of planned unit development (PUD) districts. A
designation shall be determined by, and shall be designed to lessen congestion
in the streets, to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers, to
promote health and the general welfare, to provide adequate light and air, to
prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population,
to preserve features of historical significance, to facilitate the adequate
provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public
requirements; and with a reasonable consideration being given, among other
things, to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for
particular uses and with a view to conserving the land throughout the city. In
a PUD district, the regulations which are adopted are intended to accomplish
the same purposes as do zoning and other applicable regulations in districts
which are developed on a lot by lot rather than a unified basis. (Ord. 2001-08,
7-26-2001)
12-4-2: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
A PUD district may be proposed for any location in the city if it is in
accordance with the provisions of the zoning regulations. (Ord. 2001-08, 7-26-
2001)
12-4-3: EFFECT OF APPROVAL:
Approval of a planned unit development district shall constitute an amendment
to the zoning ordinance. Designation of a property as a planned unit
development district in accordance with an approved development plan shall
supersede all existing and prior zoning classifications. Such property shall be
for zoning purposes and will be identified by the letters PUD followed by an
identifying number. (Ord. 2001-08, 7-26-2001)
12-4-4: COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
All planned unit development districts shall at a minimum satisfy the standards
and requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2001-08, 7-26-2001)

in meeting various requirements of the city and to provide an early preview of
the application. To obtain further information, each applicant shall confer
with the city administrator and appropriate department heads in connection with
the preparation of the PUD application. It shall be the responsibility of the
city administrator to coordinate the preapplication review. Upon review, the
city administrator shall furnish the applicant with his/her written comments
regarding the proposal including appropriate recommendations to inform and
assist the applicant in preparing the PUD application. (Ord. 2001-08, 7-26-
2001)

uses, building types and prototypical site layouts, if appropriate; 3)
provisions for maintenance of common areas; 4) any proposed agreements,
dedications or easements; 5) any proposed private covenants and restrictions;
and 6) any other information required by this chapter or pertinent to a
determination of compliance with this chapter.
   D.   A circulation plan that indicates roads adjoining the property; the
location of access from public roads into the project; and vehicular and
pedestrian circulation systems within the project. The circulation plan may be
included as part of the master conceptual plan.
   E.   An improvement plan indicates that: 1) water supply and distribution
facilities, as well as the source of the water supply; 2) sewage collection and
disposal including method and location of sewage discharge; 3) methods and
facilities for the management of stormwater runoff; 4) improvements to streets
and roads; and 5) any other physical improvements required to support the
project.
   F.   A statistical summary indicates that: 1) the number of acres in the
project; 2) the number of acres allocated to each land use within the project;

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent an applicant from
submitting, at his/her option, a subdivision plat or site plan for the
simultaneous review with the development plan. (Ord. 2001-08, 7-26-2001)
12-4-10: USES PERMITTED:
   A.   Specify Permissible Principal And Accessory Uses: The development plan
shall specify both for the project as a whole and/or for subareas within the
project, as appropriate, those principal and accessory uses that are
permissible. The city council may include or exclude uses from the development
plan or include uses with attached conditions as appropriate, to achieve the
intent of these provisions.
   B.   Council Considerations: In making its determinations of the uses to be
permitted within the PUD district, the city council may consider the
compatibility and relationship of uses within the project; the compatibility
and relationship of permitted uses adjoining or in proximity to the PUD
district; the appropriateness of permitted uses for the area in general and
their overall impact on the community; and the consistency of the permitted
uses with other adopted plans and policies. (Ord. 2001-08, 7-26-2001)
12-4-11: INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Application Of Provisions: The development plan shall contain
provisions to regulate the intensity of development within the planned unit
development district. Such provisions may apply to the project as a whole or to
subareas within the project, as appropriate.
   B.   Nonresidential Development: For nonresidential development, the
intensity of development may be regulated:
      1.   By specifying an appropriate floor area ratio(s) (FAR);
      2.   By specifying maximum square footage or gross leasable area;
      3.   By specifying setbacks, height and bulk restrictions; or
      4.   By a combination of such restrictions for the project as a whole or
for components or subareas within the project.
   C.   Performance Standards: In addition, nonresidential development plans
may specify performance standards to be imposed on the project and restrictions
regarding the location and nature of industrial, commercial, and other
residential activities. The city council may impose such standards and
restrictions, as necessary, to achieve the intent of this chapter.
   D.   Criteria: In making its determination regarding the intensity of
development and appropriate performance standards, the council may consider: 1)
character and scale of similar developments; 2) the character and scale of
surrounding development and the area in general; 3) the real or anticipated
impact on public facilities and services; and 4) consistency with other plans
and policies. (Ord. 2001-08, 7-26-2001)
12-4-12: MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS:
The density of residential dwelling units within a PUD shall be computed in
accordance with the following formula:
   A.   Maximum Residential Density: The entire area of the property to be
utilized for residential purposes divided by the maximum density as shown by
table 1 below permitted within the zoning district(s) in effect for the
property at the time of PUD district application.
      TABLE 1
Zoning Uses  Maximum
             Residential Density
Zoning Uses                   Maximum
                              Residential Density
                             
Single-family housing use    6 du/acre

12-7-3: Primary Drainage Channels
12-7-4: Secondary Drainage Channels And Surface Drainage
12-7-5: Requirements Relating To Improvements
12-7-6: Improvements Outside Dedicated Drainage Easements
12-7-1: DRAINAGE CHANNELS CLASSIFIED:
For the purpose of this title, drainage channels shall be classified as
follows:
   A.   Primary: Primary drainage channels shall be those streams, creeks, and
channels which drain an area of five hundred (500) acres or more; and
   B.   Secondary: Secondary drainage channels shall be all drainage channels
which drain an area of less than five hundred (500) acres. (1987 Code § 12-460)
12-7-2: METHODS FOR CALCULATING STREAM FLOW AND RUNOFF:
The maximum condition of rainfall for a 50-year frequency shall be used for the
purpose of determining all runoff for the sizing of drainage channels and
structures, unless otherwise specified herein. The following formulas and
values shall be used for calculating all stream flow and runoff for the
policies and regulations established herein:
   A.   Nine Hundred Acres Or Less: Runoff from drainage areas of nine hundred
(900) acres or less shall be determined by the rational formula: Q = AIR
 
Q = Flow in cubic feet per second
A = Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for areas less
    than 100 acres, and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger area
    Percent of imperviousness of the area; may vary between 70 percent and 95
I = percent. Coefficients lower than these indicated values may be used;
    however, in such instances, individual block calculations will be submitted
    with plans
R = Rate of rainfall over entire drainage area in inches per hour, based on
    time for concentration and latest government records for area
 
   B.   Greater Than Nine Hundred Acres: Runoff from drainage areas greater
than nine hundred (900) acres will be determined by use of accepted engineering
principles.
   C.   Size; Manning Formula: The size of closed storm sewers, open channels,
culverts, and bridges shall be determined using the Manning formula which may
be modified for use with runoff determined by the rational formula to:
 
Q = 1.5r 2/3 s 1/2 A    
  n                   
Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second
r = Hydraulic radius of water in conduit
s = Mean slope of hydraulic gradient in feet of vertical rise per foot of
    horizontal distance
A = Cross sectional area of water in conduit in square feet
n = Roughness coefficient, based on condition and type of material of conduit
    lining, but not less than 0.013
 
(1987 Code § 12-461)
12-7-3: PRIMARY DRAINAGE CHANNELS:
All primary drainage channels lying within, or immediately adjacent to, the
subdivision shall meet the following conditions:
   A.   Drainage For Parks Or Utility Easements: All land having an elevation
below the 50-year maximum flood elevation for the final improved channel and
not protected by levies or dikes shall be dedicated to the public for the
purpose of providing drainage for public park or utility easement use. All
dedications for public park purposes will be reviewed and approved by the
planning commission.
   B.   Cleaning, Straightening Of Channel: The existing channel lying within
or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the
free flow of water, and the channel shall be straightened, widened, and
improved to the extent required to prevent overflow, resulting from a 50-year
frequency rainfall, beyond the limits of the dedicated drainage easement
provided for in subsection A of this section.
   C.   Grading Of Building Sites, Streets: Site improvement shall provide for
the grading of all building sites and streets to an elevation where all lots,
building areas, and streets will not be subject to overflow from a 50-year
frequency flood and in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff of
stormwater.
   D.   Bank Protection; Erosion Control: Whenever channel improvement is
carried out, sodding, backsloping, cribbing, and other bank protection shall be
designed and constructed to control erosion for the anticipated conditions of
flow resulting from a 50-year frequency rainfall.
   E.   Conditions For Use Of Street Easement: A drainage channel shall not be
located in a street easement unless it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer,
except as provided below:
      1.   Unless a paved street surface at least two (2) lanes wide is
provided on both sides of a paved channel so as to provide access to abutting
properties.
      2.   Except where lots are platted to back up to the street right of way
where the drainage channel is located between the rear lot line and the paved
street; provided, that there is no access to the rear of the lot from the
street; and further provided, that at no time in the future shall access be
allowed or constructed over the open drainage channel to the rear of a lot so
platted. For the purpose of this title, a lot which sides is not considered to
back up to the street right of way.
      3.   When a condition outlined in either subsection E1 or E2 of this
section is present, adequate space shall be dedicated as right of way to
provide for maintenance of the paved drainage channel and its unpaved bank.
   F.   Drainage Structures, Construction: Culverts, bridges, and other
drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications
and design criteria of the city where the public shall have present or future
maintenance responsibility.
   G.   Cost Borne By City:
      1.   Arterial Streets: Cost of construction of bridges and culverts at
arterial streets and major thoroughfares will be borne by the city. The city
may participate in the cost of construction of bridges and culverts at
collector streets where the required hydraulic cross section of the bridge or
culvert is greater than forty (40) square feet; provided, in any event, that
participation of the city is subject to the availability of funds. Cost to be
borne by the city will be determined by the following formula:
         a.   Total cost of bridge or culvert divided by the square feet of
cross section, all multiplied by the square feet of required hydraulic cross
section less forty (40) square feet; and
         b.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent owner or
owners from bearing all costs if he or they so desire.
      2.   Residential Streets: When the planning commission, subsequent to the
submission by a developer of a preliminary plat, requires a bridge or culvert
at a residential street and the required hydraulic cross section is greater
than forty (40) square feet, the city may participate in the cost of
construction of the bridge or culvert in the same manner as provided for
collector streets in subsection G1 of this section. (1987 Code § 12-462)
12-7-4: SECONDARY DRAINAGE CHANNELS AND SURFACE DRAINAGE:
Surface drainage and all secondary channels within or adjacent to the addition
shall meet the following conditions:
   A.   Collecting Surface Water: Secondary drainage channels which have a
primary function of collecting surface water from adjacent properties or
intercepting and diverting side hill drainage shall be provided with an
improved open channel.
   B.   Transporting Water: Secondary drainage channels which have a primary
function of transporting water through the block or collecting water from cross
channels and which have a drainage area of less than forty (40) acres shall be
improved with closed storm sewers; and where the secondary drainage channel has
a drainage area of greater than forty (40) acres, an improved open channel or
closed storm sewer may be provided. Within greenway developments, when the unit
area to be drained is less than four (4) acres, the city engineer may modify
the requirements of the first part of this provision to permit a paved open
channel, designed for use as a sidewalk, having a minimum width of four feet
(4') and provided with six inch (6") curbs.
   C.   Drainage Channel In Street Easement: A drainage channel shall not be
located in a street easement unless it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer,
except as provided below:
      1.   Unless a paved street surface at least two (2) lanes wide is
provided on both sides of a paved channel so as to provide access to abutting
properties.
      2.   Except where lots are platted to back up to the street right of way
where the drainage channel is located between the rear lot line and the paved
street; provided, that there is no access to the rear of the lot from the
street; and further provided, that at no time in the future shall access be
allowed or constructed over the open drainage channel to the rear of a lot so
platted. For the purpose of this title, a lot which sides is not considered to
back up to the street right of way.
      3.   When a condition outlined in either subsection C1 or C2 of this
section is present, adequate space shall be dedicated as right of way to
provide for maintenance of the paved drainage channel and its unpaved bank.
   D.   Site Grading: In a single-family residential high density development,
site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each
lot will flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel, sodded swale, or
paved street without crossing more than four (4) adjacent lots.
   E.   Surface Water Diverted To Storm Drains: Surface water collected on
streets shall be diverted to storm drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent
overflow of six inch (6") high curbs during a 25-year frequency rain for the
area and grades involved. Drainage area allowed for surface flow on streets at
point of diversion shall not exceed twenty (20) acres, regardless of flow. (See
requirements relating to improvements, subsection B of this section.)
   F.   Drainage Easement Required: Drainage easement of satisfactory width to
provide working room for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all
storm sewers.
   G.   Open Channel Improvements: Open channels shall be improved by providing
a paved section that will carry the runoff from a rain of 25-year frequency
within the lined section and a sodded section to carry the additional runoff
from a rain of 50-year frequency. Whenever an open improved channel is required
or authorized for a secondary drainage channel under the provisions of this
title and the channel crosses residential lots which have been developed under
the planned unit development or where the channel improvement is to be designed
as an area that will be maintained by a property owner's association, then,
upon recommendation of the city engineer, the city council may modify the
requirements of the first part of this subsection to permit a channel
improvement design in keeping with landscaping architectural plans, provided
all hydraulic requirements to support the overflow resulting from a 50-year
frequency rainfall are met. (1987 Code § 12-463)
12-7-5: REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Bridges And Culverts:
      1.   All flow of water across continuous streets or alleys shall be
through culverts or bridges;
      2.   Bridges and culverts shall be sized to accommodate a 50-year
frequency rain, without increasing the depth of flow in the channel; and
      3.   Design of bridges and culverts shall conform to construction
specifications of the city.
   B.   Closed Storm Sewers: Closed storm sewers shall be constructed to
precast or prefabricated pipe or built in place of closed box design to conform
with city's construction specifications. Storm sewers carrying runoff from
streets may be designed to serve a 10-year frequency rain for the drainage area
involved; provided, that overflow from a 25-year frequency rain can reach a
suitable outlet without inundating an elevation one foot (1') below any house
pad elevation. In cases where the above cannot be accomplished, the storm sewer
shall be designed to serve a 25-year frequency rain. Sizing shall be calculated
by the Manning formula.
   C.   Open Paved Storm Drainage Channels: Open paved storm drainage channels
shall be constructed in accordance with city specifications. Side slopes above
the paved section shall be shaped and sodded on a slope of three (3) horizontal
to one vertical or flatter. Fences shall be erected adjacent to the paved
section only as directed by the planning commission. (1987 Code § 12-464)
12-7-6: IMPROVEMENTS OUTSIDE DEDICATED DRAINAGE EASEMENTS:
The city reserves the right to require improvements to preclude any backup of
tail waters inundating any areas outside of the dedicated drainage easements in
the subdivision as a result of a 50-year frequency flood. (1987 Code § 12-465)
