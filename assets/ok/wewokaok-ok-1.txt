1-2-3: EFFECT OF REPEAL; COURT PROCEEDINGS:
   A.   Reviving Prior Ordinances; Effect On Punishment:
      1.   The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinances in force
before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect.
      2.   The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or
penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or
proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed under
the ordinance repealed. (1983 Code § 1-104)
   B.   Offenses: No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a

to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done,
any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or
claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any
such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as
practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be mitigated by any
provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the party
affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes
effect.

by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making
any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   D.   Current Pending Actions: Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general
ordinance of the city herein repealed, and the provisions of all general
ordinances contained in this code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions
and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this chapter be
deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or
to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the city under any ordinance or provision thereof in
force at the time of the adoption of this city code. (2005 Code)

immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or of the public generally.
      2.   It is recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and
even to require the city administrator or other appropriate officer or agency
of the city government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate
such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action
can be taken toward such abatement.
   B.   Submission Of Statement Of Nuisance Condition:
      1.   The chief of the fire department, the chief of police, the city
attorney, the building inspector, the electrical inspector, the plumbing

council, a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the
ordinances of the city or law, and a request or recommendation that it be
abated.

member, or any resident of the city may submit such a statement and request a
recommendation to the city council.
   C.   Council Determination; Hearing; Notice:

abated, the council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to
the owner of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed
responsible for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to
be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such
notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by
mail or by service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known;
but, if the names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare of the persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city.
   D.   Abatement By City; Assessment Of Costs:
      1.   If the council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate such nuisance within a specified time if the peace, health, safety,
morals or welfare of the persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other person responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
such nuisance within the specified time, the council shall direct the mayor to
abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as
authorized by 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 16.

abatement to the owner or other person responsible for or causing the nuisance,

agent is unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a
copy thereof on the premises, or by publication in at least one issue of a
newspaper having a general circulation in the city.
   B.   Abatement By City; Assessment Of Costs: If the order is not complied
with, the health officer may cause the order to be executed and complied with,
and the cost thereof shall be certified to the city clerk, and the cost of
removing or abating such nuisance shall be added to the water bill or other
city utility bill of the owner or occupant if he is a user of water from the
city water system or such other utility service. The cost shall be treated as a
part of such utility bill to which it is added, and shall become due and
payable, and be subject to the same regulations relating to delinquency in
payment, as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is not a user of
any city utility service, such cost, after certification to the city clerk, may

collected. (1983 Code § 8-311)

shall the city of Wewoka be liable for costs or fees charged by the private
facility. Further, the court may assess the owner the cost of transporting the
animal to the privately operated impoundment facility.

enforcement officer.
      4.   Grease interceptors will be pumped out a minimum of once every three
(3) months or as often as needed. If the code enforcement officer inspects the
generator, and their conclusion is that the grease interceptor or trap needs to
be cleaned, then the generator is to clean it.
   B.   Maintenance Log And Reporting:
      1.   It is mandatory that every year all facilities with a grease
interceptor maintain a current maintenance log for a period of twelve (12)
months. The facility will keep this log on file for a minimum time period of
three (3) years. This log will be kept in a conspicuous location for
inspections and will be immediately available to a representative of the city
who may be performing such inspections.
      2.   The reporting date will be from January 1 through December 31.
      3.   The facility will be required to send a copy of the maintenance log
to the code enforcement officer at the end of the reporting year. The code
enforcement officer must receive this copy no later than January 31, for the
previous year. (Ord. 445, 8-13-2002; amd. 2005 Code)

2002)
      2.   A book of manifests will be issued to each transporter, which has
been permitted, by the city. The transporter will ensure that all parts of the
form are completed entirely. The transporter will leave the appropriate copies
of the manifest with the generator, code enforcement officer and the disposal
site. All generators and transporters will keep their copies of manifests on

three hundred milligrams per liter (300 mg/l). A fee of five hundred dollars
($500.00) and one dollar ($1.00) per pound will be charged for any sample over
three hundred milligrams per liter (300 mg/l). The following formula will be
used to determine the pounds of FOGs: average monthly water usage x mg/l (over
300 mg/l) x 8.34 lbs/gal = lbs of FOGs x $1.00 per pound. This fee will be
established to recover the cost of the wastewater treatment plant to remove
FOGs from the wastewater. The amount of FOGs being discharged into the POTW by
a facility will be determined by sampling the discharge of the facility and
having the sample analyzed for the amounts of FOGs. Samples will be taken from
the facility at the discretion of the city code enforcement officer or his
designee. However, an additional sample may be requested by the facility, but
that facility will be responsible for the cost of any additional analysis and
sampling requested. (Ord. 445, 8-13-2002; amd. 2005 Code)
   D.   Sampling And Analysis Fees:
      1.   There will be no sampling or analysis fee for any generator that is
in compliance with all sewer ordinances or resolutions.

public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, and includes:
      1.   The potential for serious contamination of water wells within the
city;
      2.   A threat to the health and physical safety of children and other
residents of the city who may live, work or play in the area of operation; a
disturbance of the city's peace and serenity through noxious odors, dust, and
loud noises;
      3.   A general threat to the well being in the community through
potential fire dangers, fluid spills and other damages to the surface; and
      4.   A threat of physical destruction of municipal facilities caused by
heavy equipment.
   B.   It is therefore the intent and purpose of this chapter to recognize the
legitimate interests of oil and gas operations but to reasonably and uniformly
regulate those operations in harmony with the activities and land uses within
the city for the general benefit of the public good. (Ord. 462, 2-12-2008)

(24" x 30"), containing the name, address and emergency phone number of the oil
producing company and operator shall be posted prominently on the gate to the

and such remodeling adds to the historical character of the district,
restoration may conform to the remodeling and not to the original design.
      3.   Where the original design of the building cannot be determined, or
where full scale restoration is determined not to be economically feasible by
the commission, a design of a facade in keeping with the remainder of the
buildings in the same block shall be deemed acceptable. A contemporary design
may be approved by the commission in such circumstances; provided, that the
design is compatible with the remainder of the buildings in the same block in
scale, proportion, material, color, rhythm of solids to voids, repetition of
design elements and directional expression whether such expression shall be
vertical or horizontal.
      4.   Facades finished in decorative metal shall be preserved and
refinished so that such metal appointments will be retained. Textured metal
interior or exterior ceilings shall be retained.
      5.   The use of canvass awnings within the district shall be encouraged.
The size and scale of such awnings shall be appropriate for the building to
which they are attached, and the installation of such awnings shall be based
upon historical photographic or pictorial evidence where available. (1983 Code
§ 12-613)
      6.   Any business sign, logo or advertisement attached to or suspended
from the facade of any building or painted on the show windows and/or doors of
any business within the district shall be kept maintained and cleaned so as to
be presentable and present a positive image. Rusted, faded, broken or in any
other way deteriorated signs shall be repaired or replaced. Businesses that
move or cease operation shall remove such signs from the facade, windows and
doors of their buildings. In cases where the building is or was a rental
property, the property owner has the ultimate responsibility for removal of
signs from closed or vacated businesses. (Ord. 422, 7-8-1997)
   B.   Windows And Doors:
      1.   Original sills, lintels, frames, sash, and glass windows and
transoms shall be preserved and repaired. Original doorway elements shall be
preserved. Replacements for original materials shall duplicate original
specifications for such materials.
      2.   Translucent or clear glass may be used in windows, doors and
transoms. Plastic or synthetic glazing shall be prohibited.
      3.   Blocking of existing wall openings to accommodate standard door
frames, window sashes, and glass sizes to hide ceilings lowered beneath the
tops of existing windows shall be discouraged. Original dimensions of existing
wall openings shall be retained.
      4.   Decorative wood or metal lintels, brackets, and other window or
doorway trim shall be preserved and should be restored where possible.
      5.   Aluminum sashes and screens, when used, shall match historic frames
and sash features in white bronze or black finish. The same conditions shall
apply to aluminum door frames and screen doors.
      6.   Any remaining fire shutters or doors which are in original condition
shall be preserved. In restoration, where documents or photographs indicate the
presence of such features, reinstallation shall be encouraged. Replica fire
shutters and doors need not duplicate original specifications.
   C.   Cornices:
      1.   Restoration of cornices in original materials shall be preferred to
duplication in contemporary materials. When the commission determines that
restoration using original materials is not feasible, the use of contemporary
materials shall be acceptable. An acceptable alternative to full scale
restoration is construction of a new cornice with contemporary materials
duplicating original design. Surviving original cornice elements shall be
preserved where possible.
      2.   Wood and metal cornices shall be painted duplicating original
colors. When original colors cannot be determined, use of subdued tones shall
be encouraged including blacks and browns, bone whites, or buff colors.
Florescent or "day-glo" colors shall be prohibited.
      3.   Brick corbels shall be preserved and shall be restored and treated
in the same manner as brick wall surfaces where possible.
      4.   All gutters, downspouts and flashing shall be visually
inconspicuous.
   D.   Roofs And Rooflines:
      1.   All building roofs and rooflines shall retain their original shapes.
      2.   Contemporary roofing materials shall be acceptable. Where visible
from a public street or sidewalk, roofing materials shall be dark and
unobtrusive.
   E.   Brick And Stone:
      1.   Brick and stone are the predominant building materials in the Wewoka
switch development district. Such materials shall be treated in a manner which
will foster preservation, and they shall not be defaced or treated in a manner
which will accelerate deterioration. Synthetic materials shall not be used as a
covering. Stucco, asbestos shingles or siding, wood, aluminum siding or
plastics as covering shall be prohibited.
      2.   Since sandblasting accelerates brick and stone deterioration, this
process shall not be used as a cleaning method.
      3.   Brick and stone may be cleaned by applying mild chemical solutions;
by scrubbing with soft wire brushes; or by spraying with water under high
pressure or by steam cleaning.
      4.   Brick or stone which has been sandblasted prior to the adoption of
this chapter should be silicone treated once every four (4) years to repel
moisture.
      5.   In repointing, deteriorated mortar shall be raked out to a depth of
one-half inch (1/2") in both vertical and horizontal joints and then washed to
remove small loose particles. Hammer and chisel shall be the preferred means
for old mortar removal. New mortar shall approximate the proportions of lime,
sand, and other materials in the old mortar. The process of matching old mortar
will be such that it will assure proper color and texture and will match the
chemical composition of existing mortar.
      6.   When deteriorated brick or stone must be replaced, such replacement
brick or stone shall match the old material in color, texture, size and
alignment or coursing technique. Replacement brick shall be placed flush with
other bricks and mortar shall be laid in the same area of bond as the original.
      7.   Repainting is the preferred treatment for brick or stone material
which has been painted previously; however, the color of paint applied shall
match as closely as possible the natural color of the material. Brick or stone
which has not been painted previously shall be painted only when it is required
to unify a facade where repair work fails to match original appearance and is
visually disruptive.
      8.   The treatment recommended for brick that has been covered with
stucco prior to the adoption of this chapter is smoothing the surface with a
skim or light coat of stucco and painting such surface a color approaching the
natural color of brick or stone. Artificial mortar joints may be suggested by
painting in mortar joints in a color approximating the natural color of mortar.
   F.   Color:
      1.   Color choices may express individual taste, but shall always be
colors which contribute to the character of the individual district. Such color
choices shall be based on precedent and shall harmonize with other colors on
the same building and on the same streetscape. Bright and high gloss paints and
colors shall be prohibited.
      2.   Where wood or metal surfaces of windows, doors, porches, and other
details other than cornices are to be painted, a range of color choices shall
be available. Muted and earth as well as off white or buff colors shall be
favored, including, but not limited to, gray, brown, blue gray, beige, brick
red and terra cotta. Lead white shall be an appropriate trim and detail color.
      3.   Where brick and stone work has been painted, repairing in a color
equivalent to the color of natural brick or stone shall be preferred. Mortar
joints may also be painted in a color equivalent to natural mortar color. Lead
white shall be an acceptable color where the paint history of the building
indicates the previous use of colors other than brick red. Brick or stone
buildings which have not been painted previously shall not be painted, except
as indicated in subsection E7 of this section.
      4.   The use of one or two (2) colors in addition to white, black or gray
shall be acceptable. Secondary colors shall be used on major design or
structural elements and shall not be used to pick out individual details.
   G.   Street Accessories:
      1.   Signs and graphics for which the city is responsible shall be of
traditional style single lettering consistent in color.
      2.   Parking lots and waste receptacles shall be screened from public
view by fences, earth berm or shrubbery. (1983 Code § 12-613)
9-11-12: DEMOLITION OR REMOVAL:

a notice to correct such defects, which notice shall be delivered in person or
by mail to the owner or owners as listed on the tax rolls of the treasurer of
Seminole County. Such notice shall contain the title and section of this
chapter applicable thereto, and shall, upon postmark or personal delivery,
provide the owner with ninety (90) consecutive calendar days to correct such
defect or defects.
      2.   Failure of the owner to take any action to correct such defects
within such ninety (90) day period shall be deemed an offense and shall be
punishable by a fine as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. Each day of continuing violation shall be deemed a separate
offense.
   C.   Extension Of Time: If the owner has begun but not finished repair or
corrective work on such building or structure within the ninety (90) day period
defined herein, the inspector may grant an extension of time in which such work
must be completed, but such extension shall be for a period of not more than
one hundred eighty (180) days from the end of the initial ninety (90) day
notification period defined herein.

commission may institute an action for injunctive relief to restrain or enjoin
or to cause the correction or removal of any violation of this chapter, or for
a permanent injunction in an appropriate case, and based on the individual
merits of such a case. (Ord. 415, 3-12-1996)

10-9-1: INTENT:
Within the districts established by this title or amendments that may later be
adopted, there exist structures and uses which were lawful before this title
was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this
title or future amendment to this title. It is the intent of this title to
permit these nonconformities to continue until they are terminated but not to
encourage their survival nor to permit their enlargement, expansion, or
extension. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building,
where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date hereof, and
pursuant to such permit, construction is diligently carried to completion.
(Ord., 3-8-1971)
10-9-2: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND:
When at the effective date of this title or amendment thereto a lawful use of
land exists, which would not be permitted by the terms of this title or
amendment thereto, such use shall be deemed a nonconforming use of land and may
be continued, provided:
   A.   No such nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming
use, nor enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land
than was occupied at the effective date of this title or amendment thereof.
   B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of this title or amendment thereof.
   C.   No additional structure (other than fences) shall be erected in
connection with such nonconforming use of land.
   D.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than sixty (60) days (except when government action impedes
access to the premises), any subsequent use of such land shall conform in all
respects to the regulations of the districts. (Ord., 3-8-1971)
10-9-3: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
A sign lawfully existing at the effective date of the adoption or amendment of
this title but which would be prohibited under the terms of this title or
amendment to this title shall be deemed nonconforming, and may continue if not
altered, rebuilt, enlarged, extended, or relocated; provided, that if such
nonconforming sign is located in an R district, such sign shall be removed
within two (2) years from the effective date of this title or amendment
thereof. (Ord., 3-8-1971)
10-9-4: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OTHER THAN SIGNS:
A structure, lawfully existing at the effective date of the adoption or
amendment of this title, but which would be prohibited by the terms of this
title by reason of restrictions on floor area, height, yards, its location on
the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure shall be deemed
nonconforming and may continue, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Enlarging Or Altering: No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged
or altered in a manner which increases its nonconformity, but any structure may
be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   B.   Damage Or Destruction:
      1.   Should such structure be damaged or partially destroyed by any means
to the extent of more than ten percent (10%) but less than fifty percent (50%)
of its replacement cost at time of damage, the restoration as a nonconforming
structure shall be subject to the board of adjustment's finding, after
adherence to the procedural requirements for a special exception, that its
restoration to a conforming structure cannot reasonably be made in view of the
nature and extent of the nonconformity and the nature and extent of the
damages.
      2.   Should such structure be damaged or destroyed by any means to the
extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost, at the time of
damage, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made unless every portion of such
structure is made to conform in every respect to the provisions of the district
in which located. (Ord., 3-8-1971)
10-9-5: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES:
When at the effective date of this title or amendment thereto, there exists a
lawful use of a structure, or use of a principal structure and premises, or use
of premises and accessory structures, such structures covering more than ten
percent (10%) of the lot area, and such lawful use would not be permitted by
the terms of this title or amendment thereto, such use shall be deemed
nonconforming and may continue, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged,
extended, or structurally altered, except in changing the use of the structure
to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   B.   A nonconforming use of a portion of a building may be extended to the
remaining portions of the building if such portions were manifestly arranged
and designed for such use and the extension requires no structural alterations,
but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building.
   C.   A nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, if superseded by a permitted use, shall not thereafter be resumed.
   D.   A nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, if discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months or for
eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period (except when governmental
action impedes access to the premises) shall not thereafter be resumed.
   E.   Should the structure containing a nonconforming use be damaged or
partially destroyed to the extent of more than ten percent (10%) but less than
fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of damage, the restoration
of the structure shall be subject to the board of adjustment's finding, after
adherence to the procedural requirements for a special exception, that the
contemplated restoration is necessary for the continuance of the nonconforming
use, and will not result in any increases of incompatibility with the present
and future use of proximate properties. Should the structure containing a
nonconforming use be damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than fifty
percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of damage, the nonconforming use
shall not thereafter continue or be resumed.
   F.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, termination of the use of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the use of the land.
   G.   A nonconforming use of a structure or of a structure and premises in
combination shall not be changed unless changed to a use permitted in the
district in which located. (Ord., 3-8-1971)
10-9-6: REPAIR OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
   A.   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of walls, fixtures,
wiring, or plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the
replacement cost of the structure; provided, that the cubic content existing
when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
   B.   If a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming
use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and
maintenance, and a final order of vacation or demolition is entered by any duly
authorized official by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
used, restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the provisions
of the district in which located. (Ord., 3-8-1971)

1) where it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and
in conformity with the other requirements of this title; 2) where it is found
that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided; or 3) where it becomes necessary to acquire
the remaining half by condemnation so it may be improved in the public
interest.
   I.   Dimensions: For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the
minimum right of way widths for streets, alleys, or pedestrianways included in
any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum.

the extension of main water or sewer lines or similar utilities, easements of
greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots.
   B.   Utility Easements: Utility easements shall connect with easements
established in adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not
thereafter be changed without the approval of the city council by ordinance,
upon the recommendation of the planning commission.
   C.   Pole Guys: Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the
outside of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the
exterior angle so that pole guys will fall along the side lot lines.
   D.   Drainage Easements: Drainage easements for storm sewers may be
required. Easements for open channel drainage may be required where the cost
for the installation of storm sewers is considered to be prohibitive. These
easements may be along the side lot lines, but usually the design should be
such that the drainage will be carried along the rear of the lots. If open
channel drainage is to be carried in the street right of way, additional right
of way width shall be provided. When the drainage is carried down the rear lot
lines, the easement shall be of adequate width for workmen (with trucks if need
be) to enter the easement and keep it cleaned out. The size and location of
such easements for open channel drainage shall be determined by the city.

Notes
1 1. See section
  10-5E-4 of this code for FP floodplain district regulations.
12-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Oklahoma has
in 11 Oklahoma Statutes sections 41-47, as amended, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city of Wewoka, Oklahoma, ordains the
following, to become effective immediately.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the city of Wewoka are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter uses the following methods:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 474, 5-12-2011)

so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up
to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones AE, A, and X,
"elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 4, 1972.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).

FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within city of Wewoka subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

in subs
12-1-3B of this chapter. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use that cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair

LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of title 44 CFR.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term

elevations shown on the city of Wewoka flood insurance rate maps are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by the city of Wewoka city council and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city of Wewoka city
council.
OWRB: The Oklahoma water resources board.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (public law 97-348),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the city of Wewoka city council to a person from
the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a
manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see section
60.6 of title 44 CFR.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical
datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

special flood hazard identified by FEMA in a scientific and engineering report
entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study For Seminole County, Oklahoma And
Incorporated Areas" dated July 18, 2011, with the accompanying flood insurance
rate map (FIRM) are hereby adopted on July 18, 2011, by reference and declared
to be a part of this chapter. However, until this date the current effective
flood maps for the city of Wewoka, dated July 2, 1992, shall be used for this
purpose until July 18, 2011.
   C.   Establishment Of Development Permit: A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered,
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and any other ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   F.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the city of Wewoka or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 474, 5-12-2011)
12-1-4: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of The Floodplain Administrator: The city council of the
city of Wewoka designates a floodplain administrator to administer and
implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of

prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of
such notification to the FEMA.
      7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      8.   Shall require the developer/applicant to determine and provide the
base flood elevation on two (2) FEMA elevation certificates, one
preconstruction and one postconstruction, as well as other data as required in
order to administer the provisions of section
12-1-5 of this chapter.
      9.   When a floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zone AE as
delineated on the Seminole County FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
city of Wewoka.
      10.   After a disaster or other type of damage occurrence to structures
in the city of Wewoka, determine if the residential and nonresidential
structures and manufactured homes have been substantially damaged, and enforce
the substantial improvement requirement.
      11.   Maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal from a
decision of the city council.
      12.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining
to the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Permit Procedures:
      1.   An application for a development permit shall be presented to the
floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
         a.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; and
         b.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      2.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         c.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         d.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         e.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         f.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         h.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         i.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
         j.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area.
      3.   The floodplain administrator or city council, as applicable, may
approve certain development in zones A or AE delineated on the Seminole County
FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than
one foot (1'), provided that the applicant for the development permit in that
case first complies with 44 CFR section 65.12.
   D.   Variances:
      1.   General Provisions:
         a.   The board of adjustment may grant variances for uses which do not
satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma floodplain management act or this
chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that: 1)
compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable
taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people and 2)
satisfies the pertinent provisions of this subsection D. However, no variance
shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the
continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
         b.   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma floodplain
management act or by other laws of the state.
         c.   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
twenty (20) years.
         d.   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the city
council, accompanied by a filing fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00).
         e.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection C2 of this
section and provisions of this subsection D have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
         f.   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the chairman of the board of
adjustment which states that: 1) the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to
be built lower than the base flood elevation, and 2) such construction below
the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
         g.   At such time as the board of adjustment deems the petition ready
for notification to the public, the board of adjustment shall schedule a
hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of
general circulation in Seminole County at least thirty (30) days prior to the
hearing.
         h.   The board of adjustment shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subsection
D. This appeals group shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities
involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the
public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
         i.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances;
and
            (4)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         j.   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this subsection D and
the intent of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions
to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and

any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         c.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         d.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
            (1)   The criteria of subsections D1e, D1i, D2b and D2c of this
section are met, and

   F.   City shall not be liable to grantee for any damage to grantee's cable
system caused by any city employee while performing emergency repairs within
the public ways. In all other circumstances, when city employees negligently
injure grantee's cable system, city shall only be liable to grantee for the
grantee's actual cost of materials, equipment and labor necessary to effect
repairs, with no allowance for interruptions to service or loss of revenues,
subject to any applicable limits of liability established by the Oklahoma
governmental tort liability act. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 8: ERECTION, REMOVAL AND JOINT USE OF POLES:
   A.   No poles, conduits or other structures shall be erected or installed by
grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height,
type and other pertinent aspects. Grantee shall not have a vested right to
retain the location of any pole, conduit or structure installed by grantee.
   B.   Where poles, conduits or other structures of any public utility company
are available for use by grantee, the city may require grantee to use such
poles, conduits and structures if the permission and consent of such public
utility company may be obtained by grantee and if the terms of the use
available to grantee are just and reasonable.
   C.   Where city owned utility poles are available for use by grantee,
grantee shall pay the city the same pole rental per annum as paid by grantee
for the use of a pole owned by a public utility. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 9: PERMIT FEE:
   A.   Grantee shall pay to the city as compensation for the rights and
privileges enjoyed under this permit a fee equal to five percent (5%) of gross
revenues as defined in section 1 herein. The fee shall be paid quarterly, on or
before the forty fifth day after the end of each calendar quarter. Grantee's
payments shall be accompanied by a verified report showing the basis for the
computation, including all gross revenues received during the period for which
the payment is made.
   B.   In the event any payment due quarterly is not received within sixty
(60) days from the end of the calendar quarter, grantee shall pay interest on
the amount due (at the prime rate as listed in the Wall Street Journal on the
date the payment was due), compounded daily, calculated from the date the
payment was originally due until the date the city receives the payment.
   C.   If a net permit fee underpayment is discovered as the result of an
audit, grantee shall pay interest at the rate of the eight percent (8%) per
annum, compounded quarterly, calculated from the date each portion of the
underpayment was originally due until the date grantee remits the underpayment
to the city.
   D.   The period of limitation for recovery of any permit fee payable
hereunder shall be three (3) years from the date on which payment by the
grantee is due. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 10: RATES:
   A.   The city reserves the right to regulate cable service rates as
expressly permitted by federal or state law.
   B.   The grantee may charge a fee for the recovery of costs incurred to
collect late payments for cable services if the following conditions have been
met:
      1.   The subscriber's bill sets forth when the fee will be assessed;
      2.   The fee is not assessed any earlier than the tenth day after the due
date as reflected on the subscriber's bill; and
      3.   The bill sets forth the amount of the fee.
Any fee imposed by the grantee that does not exceed six dollars ($6.00) in 2002
dollars (as adjusted annually for inflation based on the consumer price index)
shall be presumed reasonable to cover the costs associated with the delinquent
payment. The assessment of a fee pursuant to this section shall not be
construed as a limitation on the grantee's right to charge any other lawful
fees or charges. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 11: LIABILITY OF GRANTEE, INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION:
   A.   Grantee shall defend and hold the city harmless from all loss sustained
by city by reason of any suit, judgment, execution, claim or demand resulting
from grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system in
the service area.
   B.   Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect for the term of this
permit, at grantee's sole expense, a general comprehensive liability insurance
policy, issued by a company authorized to do business in the state of Oklahoma,
naming the city as additional insured, in the amount of one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage.
The insurance coverage required hereunder shall provide thirty (30) days'
notice to the city in the event of material alteration or cancellation of any
coverage afforded in said policies prior to the date said material alteration
or cancellation shall become effective. Grantee shall provide the city with a
certificate evidencing the insurance required hereunder upon request. (Ord.
446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 12: SYSTEM EXTENSIONS:
The cable system shall be extended and cable service provided upon request to
any part of the service area where there are then existing thirty five (35)
homes within one mile of the existing cable system or ten (10) homes within
one-fourth (1/4) mile of the existing cable system. Such extensions shall be at
grantee's cost, except for the published standard/nonstandard installation fees
charged to all subscribers. For purposes of this section, the distance shall be
measured from the point of the cable system which can be technically extended
to the point at which a standard installation can be provided, following the
route along which the extension would be constructed. In areas which do not
meet this density requirement, grantee may charge for extension of the cable
system based upon the cost of labor and materials. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, grantee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the
cable system into any portion of the service area where another operator is
providing cable service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the
present service area of the grantee, or into any area which is financially or
technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or
freeway crossing. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 13: OPERATIONAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Grantee shall maintain and operate the cable system so as to provide
video, audio and other signals to be delivered with signal strength and quality
levels which meet the parameters specified by the FCC and other normally
accepted industry standards. Grantee shall construct, operate and maintain the
cable system in a manner consistent with all ordinary care and all applicable
laws, ordinances, construction standards, and FCC technical standards. Upon
request, grantee shall provide the city a copy of the results of the most
recent FCC required proof of performance test conducted by grantee within the
service area.
   B.   Grantee shall provide standby power generating capacity at the cable
system headend capable of providing at least twelve (12) hours of emergency
operation. Grantee shall maintain standby power system supplies, rated for at
least two (2) hours' duration, throughout the trunk and distribution network.
   C.   Grantee may interconnect the cable system within the service area with
cable television systems owned or operated by grantee within adjacent cities.
   D.   Upon request, grantee shall provide subscribers with a parental control
locking device or digital code capable of blocking or otherwise preventing a
television set from receiving a channel or audio signal. The charge for any
such devices, if any, shall be in conformance with applicable law.
   E.   Grantee shall comply with the customer service standards set forth in
section 76.309 of the FCC's rules and regulations, as such may be amended from
time to time.
   F.   Grantee shall establish procedures for receiving, acting upon and
resolving subscriber complaints which shall be subject to the reasonable
approval of the city.
   G.   City shall notify grantee in writing of any complaint it receives from
subscribers or of any failure of grantee to comply with the terms and
conditions of this permit. Grantee, upon receipt of such notice, shall promptly
investigate the complaint and take such action as necessary to provide cable
service to subscribers and to operate the cable system as required. (Ord. 446,
11-1-2002)
SECTION 14: GOVERNMENTAL AND EDUCATIONAL USE:
The grantee, upon request, shall provide without charge, a standard
installation and one outlet of basic cable service to those administrative
buildings owned and occupied by the city, fire station(s), police station(s),
library, and K-12 public school(s) that are passed by its cable system. The
cable service provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed
outlet without authorization from grantee. The cable service provided shall not
be used for commercial purposes, and such outlets shall not be located in areas
open to the public. The city shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any
use of the grantee's cable system in any manner that results in the
inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the cable system. The city
shall hold the grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising
out of the provision and use of cable service required by this section. The
grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a
nonstandard installation is required, unless the city or building owner/
occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary cable system
extension and/or nonstandard installation. If additional outlets of basic cable
service are provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay
the usual installation and service fees associated therewith. (Ord. 446, 11-1-
2002)
SECTION 15: EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM:
   A.   If required by the FCC rules and regulations part 11, as such
provisions may be amended from time to time, the grantee shall install and
maintain an emergency alert system for use in transmitting emergency act
notifications and emergency act terminations in local and statewide situations
as may be designated to be an emergency by the local primary, the state primary
and/or the state emergency operations center, as those authorities are
identified and defined with FCC rules and regulations part 11.
   B.   The city shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized persons
to operate the EAS equipment and shall indemnify and hold harmless the grantee,
its employees, officers and assigns from any claims arising from use of the
cable system or the emergency alert system equipment by the city, its
employees, authorized representatives, or designees, including, but not limited
to, reasonable attorney fees. Additionally, the city shall indemnify, save and
hold harmless the grantee against damage, loss or inappropriate use of the
equipment and shall agree to use due care and to take reasonable precautions
against such damage, loss or inappropriate use of the emergency alert system
equipment or other cable system equipment which may be used during a declared
emergency. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 16: GOVERNMENTAL ACCESS PROGRAMMING:
   A.   Grantee shall dedicate one channel to the city solely for noncommercial
governmental access programming (the "access channel"). The city shall be
responsible for the operation, administration, maintenance and programming of
the access channel, including all costs associated with the operation of the
access channel and the production of programming carried on the access channel.
Grantee shall, at no cost to the city, provide a direct fiber linkage between
the city location and the grantee's headend. The city shall provide, at no cost
to the grantee, the necessary equipment to transmit live, videotaped or
character generated "bulletin board" type programming to subscribers over the
cable system. If the city desires to broadcast live programming on the access
channel from any city location, any cost for a direct fiber linkage between the
city location and grantee's headend, as well as any equipment necessary to
transmit the programming to the grantee's headend, shall be the city's expense.
   B.   The access channel shall not be used for the cablecast of commercial
advertising or a program whose purpose is commercial or for-profit. Except as
authorized by law, including without limitation section 611 of the cable act,
grantee shall not exercise editorial control over programming of the access
channel, other than to ensure its use for governmental purposes.
   C.   As provided by law, the city shall prescribe: 1) rules and procedures
under which the grantee is permitted to use the access channel capacity for the
provision of other services if such channel capacity is not being used for the
purposes designated herein; and 2) rules and procedures under which such
permitted use by grantee shall cease.
   D.   Except to the extent prohibited by law and in no event beyond an amount
for which the city would otherwise be liable under the governmental tort claims
act, 51 Oklahoma Statues section 151 et seq., the city agrees to indemnify,
save and hold harmless, and defend the grantee, its officers, boards and
employees from and against any liability for damages and any liability or
claims that arise out of the transmission or content of programming carried on
the access channel, including, without limitation, damages arising out of
copyright infringement and defamation. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 17: COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING:
In the event that the city believes, based on a pattern of complaints from
subscribers, that the cable system is not operating in a manner which is in
compliance with applicable state or federal laws, city may cause the grantee to
conduct such technical tests as may be reasonably necessary to determine
compliance. Such technical tests of the cable system shall be conducted during
reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of grantee or the cable system. Except in emergency
circumstances, such tests may be required only after giving grantee reasonable
notice thereof. In the event that such testing demonstrates that grantee has
substantially failed to comply with a material technical requirement, the
reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by grantee. In the event that
such testing demonstrates that grantee has substantially complied with such
material technical requirements, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the
city. Except in emergency circumstances, such testing shall be undertaken no
more than two (2) times in a calendar year. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 18: DEFAULT OF GRANTEE, PENALTIES AND REVOCATION:
   A.   The rights and privileges granted by the city to grantee under this
permit shall continue and remain in full force and effect until revoked by the
city. In the event that the city believes that grantee has not complied with
the terms of this permit, the city shall informally discuss the matter with
grantee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem, the
city shall notify grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged
default.
   B.   Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of a written notice of
default to: 1) respond contesting the alleged assertion of a default; or 2)
cure such default; or 3) in the event that, by the nature of default, such
default cannot be cured within the thirty (30) day period, initiate reasonable
steps to remedy such default and notify the city of the steps being taken and
the projected date that they will be completed.
   C.   In the event that the grantee fails to respond to the notice described
in subsection A of this section pursuant to the procedures set forth in
subsection B of this section, or in the event that the alleged default is not
remedied within thirty (30) days of the date projected pursuant to subsection B
of this section, if it intends to continue its investigation into the default,
then the city shall schedule a public hearing. The city shall provide the
grantee at least ten (10) days' prior written notice of such hearing, which
specifies the time, place and purpose of such hearing, and provide grantee the
opportunity to be heard.
   D.   In the event the city, after such hearing, determines that grantee is
in default of any provision of this permit, the city may:
      1.   Assess liquidated damages to the city caused by the default by
grantee as follows:
         a.   For knowingly failing to provide data, documents or information
as required in this permit, fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day the
failure occurs or continues following finding by the city of the default; and
         b.   For knowingly failing to comply with the service and operational
standards of this permit, one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day
the failure occurs or continues following finding by the city of the default.
      2.   In the case of default of a material provision of this permit which
is not cured by grantee or the subject of damages assessed as provided herein,
the city may revoke this permit in its entirety.
      3.   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, commence an action at law for monetary damages, or seek
injunctive relief as an alternative to damages or termination of this permit.
Any decision and/or action taken by the city hereunder shall be delivered to
the grantee promptly and in writing.
Grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly with
any provision of this permit by reason of any failure of city to enforce prompt
compliance.
   E.   The grantee may appeal any determination of default or revocation by
the city to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the
decision of the city de novo and to modify or reverse such decision as justice
may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within sixty
(60) days of the grantee's receipt of the determination of the city.
   F.   Grantee shall not be held in default with the provisions of this
permit, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto, where such
alleged default is caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages or other
events reasonably beyond the ability of grantee to control, or where such
default results from a good faith error that results in no, or minimal,
negative impact on subscribers. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 19: ASSIGNABILITY:
   A.   If grantee shall at any time assign, sell, lease or otherwise transfer
in any manner whatsoever its rights and privileges under this permit to any
person, such action shall be in writing and a duly authenticated copy shall be
filed with the city clerk. Such action shall not become effective until the
transferee shall have agreed in writing with the city to become responsible for
the full performance of all the conditions, liabilities, covenants and
obligations contained in this permit subject to applicable law, and until such
action shall have been approved by the city, provided such approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. The city may require evidence that the transferee
possesses the financial, technical and legal capability to perform all of the
conditions, liabilities, covenants and obligations contained in this permit. If
the city fails to act upon a proposed transfer within sixty (60) days after the
transferee shall have agreed in writing to become responsible for the full
performance of all of the conditions, liabilities, covenants and obligations of
this permit, then such action shall be deemed to have been approved.
   B.   A transfer, for purposes of this section, shall have the meaning given
those terms under the rules and regulations of the FCC applicable to transfers
and assignments of cable television microwave relay licenses. Provided further,
that the transfer of ownership or other interest in the grantee in connection
with an internal reorganization or internal merger to a direct or indirect
parent, subsidiary or affiliated entity under common control with grantee shall
not be a transfer for the purpose of this permit so long as: 1) the city is
notified of the proposed transfer no later than thirty (30) days prior to the
transfer; and 2) the transferee shall ensure that insurance coverage and all
other commitments under the permit continue in force and without interruption
and provide evidence of same to the city no later than thirty (30) days prior
to the proposed transfer.
   C.   No approval of the city shall be required for a transfer in trust, by
mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title or
interest of grantee in this permit or the cable system in order to secure
indebtedness of grantee. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 20: NONDISCRIMINATION:
   A.   Grantee shall not deny any person or group of potential subscribers
access to cable service because of race, color, religion, national origin, age,
gender, physical handicap or the income of residents in the local area in which
a person or group resides.
   B.   Grantee shall not unlawfully discriminate in the rates or charges for
cable services or in making available cable services or facilities of the cable
system. Grantee shall not extend any preference or advantage to any subscriber
or potential subscriber to the cable system. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
grantee may conduct promotional campaigns to stimulate subscriptions to cable
services or other lawful uses of the cable system and grantee may establish
bulk billing rates and rate schedules for different classes of subscribers and
cable service which any subscriber coming within such bulk billing group, rate
or service classification shall be entitled.
   C.   Grantee shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for
employment because of race, color, religion, age, gender or national origin.
Grantee shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the United
States and of Oklahoma with respect to employment and personnel practices.
(Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 21: MODIFICATION PROCEDURE:
The application procedure of this section shall be followed by the city and the
grantee whenever a change to a term or condition of this permit is sought.
   A.   An application shall be filed with the city, in a form and containing
such supporting facts and information as the city, in its reasonably exercised
discretion, may determine to be necessary.
   B.   An application may be rejected for inadequacy by the city if it
contains an inadequate description of what is being applied for, is not in an
acceptable form, or contains insufficient facts and information for adequate
consideration.
   C.   A rejection of an application for inadequacy shall be made by written
notice to the grantee within thirty (30) days after the city receives such
application, and shall state the deficiencies. The city shall use its best
efforts to identify in the notice all apparent deficiencies in such application
so as to diminish, to the extent reasonably possible, the need for repeated
applications. The grantee shall use its best efforts to remedy the deficiencies
in the application identified by the city. The city shall have fifteen (15)
days after receipt of the grantee's revised application to determine the
adequacy of such application. If the city again rejects the application, the
grantee may appeal such rejection to the city council, which shall make a
determination of the adequacy of the application within thirty (30) days after
the grantee files its appeal. The city council may, if it determines that the
application is adequate, proceed to determine the merits of the application
pursuant to subsections G through L of this section.
   D.   Upon acceptance, city staff shall review and study the application and
consider the necessity of further study and reporting prior to making a
determination or submitting the matter to the city council. The review and
study shall be completed within sixty (60) days unless such period is extended
by the city council for cause shown by the city staff, or for a longer period
of time by agreement with the grantee.
   E.   The city staff shall, within the time specified for completion of
review and study, submit to the city council for its consideration the
grantee's application, the results of the review and study, together with the
city staff's recommendation and other pertinent information, documents and
exhibits. At the expiration of the review and study period, if the matter has
not been placed upon the city council agenda, the city council shall, upon
request of the grantee, place the application upon the city council agenda for
the next regular meeting.
   F.   During the review and study period, the grantee shall fully cooperate
with the city staff in providing information and documents which are related to
and reasonably necessary for the proper evaluation of the application. Failure
of the grantee to so cooperate or the grantee's unreasonable delay in providing
information and documents shall be grounds for the city council to grant a
reasonable extension of the review and study period or, if either the lack of
cooperation or the delay substantially impairs the study, the city council may
summarily deny the application.
   G.   Upon submission, the city council shall review the application or
appeal, any city staff studies, and information and documents which accompany
the application or appeal. The city council shall by ordinance approve or deny
the application or appeal based on the record within thirty (30) days after
completion of the review and study period. However, if the city council desires
a public hearing, or if one is required, the city council shall set a public
hearing to be held within thirty (30) days after completion of the review and
study period. Public notice of the hearing shall be given.
   H.   At a public hearing pursuant to this subsection, the city council shall
hear reports from the city staff, the grantee and the public. The city council
shall provide a reasonable but not unlimited opportunity for rebuttal. The city
council may impose reasonable time limitations on verbal presentations, which
may be selectively waived to facilitate adequate evaluation of the application
or appeal.
   I.   If, at the hearing, the city council determines that additional
information or documents are necessary to adequately evaluate the application
or appeal, it may continue the hearing from time to time pending receipt of
such information or documents. A continuance shall not exceed fifteen (15) days
at a time, and the duration of the hearing (including all continuances) shall
not exceed thirty (30) days.
   J.   Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, the city
council shall, by ordinance, approve or deny the application or appeal. Notice
of action on the application or appeal and grounds therefor shall be in
writing. The city council may attach reasonable conditions to its approval of
the grantee's application or its grant of the appeal; provided, that such
conditions are consistent with this permit. If conditions are attached to the
city council's approval, the grantee shall accept those conditions in writing
prior to taking the actions approved by the city council.
   K.   Any time limit provided in this subsection may be waived by consent of
both the city council and the grantee.
   L.   Any application or appeal made or brought pursuant to this section
shall be deemed to have been approved by the city council if the city council
fails to act on the matter within the times prescribed in this section.
   M.   In addition to the application procedure specified above, the city may
at any time seek a modification of this permit by so notifying grantee in
writing. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice, the city and grantee
shall meet to discuss the proposed modification(s). If the parties reach a
mutual agreement upon the city's suggested modification(s), such modification
(s) shall be submitted to the city council for its approval. If so approved by
the city council, acting by ordinance, then such modification(s) shall be
deemed part of this permit. If mutual agreement is not reached on the city's
request, there shall be no modification. (Ord. 446, 11-1-2002)
SECTION 22: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   A.   The city, after reasonable notice, shall have the right to review the
books and records of grantee during normal business hours as is reasonably

grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. Grantee shall not be
required to maintain any books and records for permit compliance purposes
longer than three (3) years. Grantee shall not be required to disclose
