cause to believe that the person will not appear in response to the citation
because that person has previously failed to appear pursuant to a citation and
a warrant has issued for that reason, or the person is arrested for an offense
against a person or property.
   B.   If the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause injury to
himself or others if released, the officer shall comply with the following
procedures:

that the person will cause injury to himself or others if released upon signing

under circumstances which abate the danger of injury to the person under arrest
or others;

himself or others and shall comply with the provisions of Section 52.1 of Title
43A of the Oklahoma Statutes regarding taking a person into protective custody.

including the source of information relied upon to make the determination that
the person should not be released upon acknowledging receipt of a citation;

recognizance in accordance with rules for the receipt of bail and release by
recognizance prescribed by the city judge; or take the person without delay
before the city judge for arraignment; and

representative other than the arresting officer and given an opportunity to be
admitted to bail or released on recognizance in accordance with rules and
procedures prescribed by the city judge.

(2) week period, as provided by law for the drawing of jurors for the district
court. Additional drawing of other names also may be requested by the judge,
when necessary, in accordance with the law for such additional drawings in the

of jury lists for the district court are changed, the judge shall take such
steps, in requesting jury lists for the court, as are necessary to comply with

confined. If the defendant does immediately satisfy the fine or the costs, no

of condition has made it possible for the defendant to commence making
installment payments toward the satisfaction of fine or costs.

above referred to and any order of the court, whether there be a court reporter
in attendance or not, should be reduced to writing and filed of record in the

eighteen (18) years of age, who is taken into custody for the alleged violation
of a municipal ordinance relating to one or more of the offenses listed in
subsection A of this Section other than truancy or curfew violation, and who

      3.   The child shall be detained in the municipal juvenile facility for
no longer than twenty four (24) hours; provided, if the child's parent, legal
guardian, legal custodian, attorney or other responsible adult fails to appear

year that any child:
      1.   Fails to appear for a court date on more than one occasion,

Court.
and after the expiration of ninety (90) days, the Court clerk shall mail notice
of such occurrence to the Department of Public Safety, which Department shall
thereafter suspend or deny driving privileges for such child for six (6)
months. The suspension may be modified as provided in section 6-107.2 of title
47 of the Oklahoma Statutes. In addition, the Court may require the child to
receive counseling or other community-based services, as necessary.
If a child is prosecuted for an offense in a Municipal Court, the child shall
not be prosecuted for the offense in the District Court. The Municipal Court
may also impose costs as authorized by law.

remain unpaid after three (3) months may be assessed by the Municipal Judge
against the child's parent, parents, legal guardian or legal custodian and
collected and paid as provided in section 27-122 of title 11 of the Oklahoma
Statutes. Provided, however, prior to such latter assessment, the Court clerk

(Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)
8-103: ABATEMENT GENERALLY:
   A.   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances may be
such as to justify, and even to require, the city manager or other appropriate
officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and proper action
summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until
more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   B.   The chief of the fire department, the chief of police, the city
attorney, the building inspector, the electrical inspector, the plumbing
inspector or any other officer subordinate to the city manager may submit,
through or with the consent of the city manager, to the city council, a
statement as to the existence of a nuisance, as defined by section
8-102 of this chapter or by other city ordinances or state law, and a request
or recommendation that it be abated. The city manager himself, the health
officer, any councilman or any resident of the city may submit such a statement
and request or recommendation to the city council.
   C.   Upon receipt of a statement and request or recommendation under
subsection B of this section, the council shall determine whether or not the
alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence
on the subject, the council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses,
books, papers and other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or to
have it abated, the council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed
statement to the owner of any property concerned and to any other person
alleged or deemed responsible for or to be causing the nuisance, and an
adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a hearing
can be given. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be
given in writing by mail or by service by a police officer, if their names and
addresses are known. If the names or addresses are not known, and the public
peace, health, safety, morals or welfare would not be unduly jeopardized by the
necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be publicized in a paper of
general circulation within the city.
   D.   If the council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time, if the public peace, health, safety, morals
or welfare would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such
peace, health, safety, morals or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the
consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons responsible for or causing
the nuisance do not abate it within the specified time, the council shall
direct the city manager to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary
abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 16. The
city clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the
owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just
under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are known. Until paid,
such cost shall constitute a debt to the city collectible as other debts of the
city may be collected.
   E.   In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance,
the city may bring suit in the district court, as provided in 50 Oklahoma
Statutes section 17. (Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)
   F.   No action for nuisance shall be brought against agricultural activities
on farm or ranch land which has lawfully been in operation for two (2) years or
more prior to the date of bringing the action. (Ord. 587, 11-17-2009)
8-104: ABATEMENT OF HEALTH NUISANCES:
   A.   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 Oklahoma Statutes section 1-209,
the city council shall appoint an officer who shall have authority to order the
owner or occupant of any private premises in the city to remove from such
premises, at his own expense, any source of filth, cause of sickness, condition
conducive to the breeding of insects or rodents that might contribute to the
transmission of disease, or any other condition adversely affecting the public
health, within twenty four (24) hours, or within such other time as may be
reasonable, and a failure to do so shall constitute an offense. Such order
shall be in writing and may be served personally on the owner or occupant of
the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the appointed officer or by a
policeman, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of abode of
the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state. If the premises
are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is unknown,
or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on
the premises, or by publication in at least one issue of a newspaper having a
general circulation in the city.
   B.   If the order is not complied with, the appointed officer may cause the
order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified
to the city clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be
added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if
he is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility service.
The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added,
and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same regulations
relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If such owner
or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost, after
certification to the city clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any
other debt due the city may be collected. (Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)
8-105: ABATEMENT PROCEDURES CUMULATIVE:
The various procedures for abating nuisances prescribed by this chapter and by
other provisions of state law and city ordinance shall be cumulative one to the
other and the city may elect to follow any such procedure which is applicable
in abating any particular nuisance. (Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)
8-106: AUTHORITY OF OFFICERS; APPEAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS:
   A.   Pursuant to the authority granted by 11 Oklahoma Statutes section 22-
111 as amended in 1986, the city hereby designates the city manager to carry
out the duties of nuisance abatement. Provided that this designation does not
diminish the authority granted to health officers under section
8-104 of this chapter, but instead shall be interpreted as granting concurrent
jurisdiction and authority.
   B.   Any administrative order issued by the city manager shall be appealable
to the city council by the person against whom the order was directed, by the
filing of a written notice of appeal with the municipal clerk within ten (10)
days after the administrative order is rendered. (Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)
8-107: RECURRING OR INTERMITTENT ABATEMENT:
   A.   Some nuisances are of such a nature as to recur intermittently over a
significant period of time, but to be interrupted or to occur in such an
unpredictable schedule that such nuisances avoid abatement under existing
procedures. Such a situation is particularly likely to occur where lawfully
licensed and operable vehicles are parked repetitively in violation of the city
codes or where such parking repetitively occurs for less than twenty four (24)
hours at a time. Nonetheless, such repetitive violations are and remain a
public nuisance with significant impacts on the general welfare within the
neighborhood in which the violations occur.
   B.   It shall be the policy of the city to utilize the abatement procedures
set forth in this chapter whenever possible. However, in those instances in
which such efforts are unsuccessful, the applicable enforcement officer of the
city shall submit, in writing, a report to the city manager summarizing the
efforts of the officer or the department to enforce the applicable traffic
ordinances and nuisance ordinances against the vehicle and the owner and
operator thereof. A copy of the report shall be mailed to the registered owner
of the personal property and real property, at the last known place of
residence as shown on the registration forms; said report or accompanying
letter shall specify the precise way in which the vehicle is being parked
illegally and constituting a public nuisance. Thereafter, the city manager has
the discretion to summarily abate the nuisance by ordering the vehicle to be
impounded and towed from any location within the city wherein it is found to be
parked illegally or to constitute a public nuisance. Such an order for
impoundment and towing shall be effective for ninety (90) days after the
issuance of this impound order by the city manager.
   C.   Any owner or operator in receipt of such notice may request a hearing
before the city manager and shall be given an opportunity to show why the
vehicle should not be impounded as a public nuisance upon its next discovery in
violation of this code.
Furthermore, such owner or operator shall have the right to appeal any decision
the city manager may make at such hearing to the city council for final
determination. (Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)
8-108: PENALTY:
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be punished as
provided in section
8-401 of this part. (Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)

The City Manager, or his designee, may cause property within the City limits to
be cleared of trash or weeds and grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with
the following procedures:
   A.   At least ten (10) days' notice shall be given to the property owner, by
mail, at the address shown by the current year's tax roll in the County
Treasurer's Office, before the City Manager or his designee holds a hearing or
takes action. The notice shall order the property owner to clean the property
of trash or to cut or mow the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate,
and said notice shall further state that unless such work is performed within
ten (10) days of the date of the notice, the work shall be done by the City,
and a notice of lien shall be filed with the County Clerk against the property
for the costs due and owing the City. At the time of mailing of notice to the
property owner, the City shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal
service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and
address of the mailee. If the property owner cannot be located within ten (10)
days of the date of mailing, notice may be given by posting a copy of the
notice on the property or by publication, as defined in 11 Oklahoma Statutes
1991, section
1-102, one (1) time not less than ten (10) days prior to a hearing or action by
the City. If the City anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance
with this chapter or applicable State law, the notice, whether by certified
mail, or posting or publication, shall state that:
      1.   Any accumulations of trash or excessive weed or grass growth on the
owner's property occurring within six (6) months after the removal of trash or
cutting or mowing of weeds or grass on the property pursuant to such notice may
be summarily abated by the City;
      2.   The costs of such abatement shall be assessed against the owner; and
      3.   A lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment all
without further prior notice to the property owner. (Ord. 644, 5-15-2012)
   B.   The owner of the property may give his written consent to the City
authorizing the removal of the trash or the mowing of the weeds or grass. By
giving said written consent, the owner waives his right to a hearing.
   C.   A hearing may be held by the City Manager or his designee to determine
whether the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass has caused
the property to become detrimental to the health, benefit, and welfare of the
public and the community or a hazard to traffic, or creates a fire hazard to
the danger of property.
   D.   Upon finding that the condition of the property constitutes a detriment
or hazard, and that the property would be benefited by the removal of such
conditions, the agents of the City are granted the right of entry on the
property for the removal of trash, mowing of weeds or grass, and the
performance of the necessary duties as a governmental function of the City.
Immediately following the cleaning or mowing of the property, the City Clerk
shall file a notice of lien with the County Clerk describing the property and
the work performed by the City, and stating that the City claims a lien on the
property for the cleaning or mowing costs.
   E.   The City Manager or his designee shall determine the actual cost of
such cleaning and mowing and any other expenses as may be necessary in
connection therewith, including the cost of notice and mailing. The City Clerk
shall forward, by mail, to the property owner, a statement of such actual cost
and demanding payment. (Ord. 505, 9-2-2003)
   F.   If payment is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the
mailing of the statement, then within the next thirty (30) days, the Municipal
Clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the
County Treasurer of the County in which the property is located and the same
shall be levied on the property and collected by the County Treasurer as other
taxes authorized by law. Once certified by the County Treasurer, payment may
only be made to the County Treasurer except as otherwise provided for in this
section. In addition the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien against
the property from the date the cost is certified to the County Treasurer,
coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special
assessment and prior and superior to all other titles and liens against the
property, and the lien shall continue until the cost shall be fully paid. At
the time of the collection the County Treasurer shall collect a fee of five
dollars ($5.00) for each parcel or property. The fee shall be deposited to the
credit of the General Fund of the County. If the County Treasurer and the
Municipality agree that the County Treasurer is unable to collect the
assessment, the Municipality may pursue a civil remedy for collection of the
amount owing and interest thereon by an action in person against the property
owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A
mineral interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the
surface owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created
pursuant to this section. Upon receiving payment, if any, the Municipal Clerk
shall forward to the County Treasurer a notice of such payment and directing
discharge of the lien. (Ord. 656, 10-2-2012)
   G.   The property owner shall have a right of appeal to the City Council
from any order of the City Manager or his designee. Such appeal shall be taken
by filing written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within ten (10) days
after the order of the City Manager or his designee is rendered. (Ord. 505, 9-
2-2003)

If the City Manager or his designee causes property within the City limits to
be cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with
the procedures provided for in section
8-203 of this chapter, any subsequent accumulations of trash or excessive weed
or grass growth on the property occurring within a six (6) month period may be
declared to be a nuisance and may be summarily abated without further prior
notice to the property owner. At the time of each such summary abatement, the
City shall notify the property owner of the abatement and the costs thereof.
The notice shall state that the property owner may request a hearing within ten
(10) days after the date of mailing the notice. The notice and hearing shall be

such abatement shall be determined and collected as provided for in subsections

12-520: Penalties For Noncompliance
12-521: Certification
12-501: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city of Grove are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 599, 6-1-2010)
12-502: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 599, 6-1-2010)
12-503: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
   A.   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 599, 6-1-2010)

construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by the city of Grove city council and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (public law 97-348),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of

manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the city of Grove board of adjustment to a
person from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full
requirements see section 60.6 of title 44 CFR.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical
datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 599, 6-
1-2010)
12-510: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
   B.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 599, 6-1-2010)
12-511: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city of Grove or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 599, 6-1-
2010)
12-512: FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   Designation: The city council of the city of Grove designates the
building inspector as floodplain administrator to administer and implement the
provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of national flood
insurance program regulations in title 44 CFR pertaining to floodplain
management. In the absence of the building inspector, the public works director
will serve as the floodplain administrator.
   B.   Duties And Responsibilities: Duties and responsibilities of the
floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      1.   Become accredited by the OWRB in accordance with 82 Oklahoma
Statutes sections 1601-1618, as amended.
      2.   Review permit applications to determine whether the proposed
building sites, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be
reasonably safe from flooding.
      3.   Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
required by this chapter.
      4.   Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits
have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval are required.
      5.   Make the necessary interpretation where interpretation is needed as
to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions).
      6.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the OWRB
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of
such notification to the FEMA.
      7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      8.   In the absence of FEMA BFE, The City of Grove shall require the
applicant or developer to provide the base flood elevation and other elevation
data on the FEMA Elevation Certificate in order to administer the provisions of
Sections
12-515 through
12-518 of this chapter.
      9.   When a floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zone AE as
delineated on the Delaware County FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
city of Grove.
      10.   After a disaster or other type of damage occurrence to structures
in the city of Grove, determine if the residential and nonresidential
structures and manufactured homes have been substantially damaged, and enforce
the substantial improvement requirement.
      11.   Maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal from a
decision of the city council.
      12.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining
to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 599, 6-1-2010; amd. Ord. 774, 8-6-
2019)
12-513: PERMIT PROCEDURES:
   A.   An application for a development permit shall be presented to the
floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
      1.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; and
      2.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   B.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      6.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
      7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
      8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      9.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
      10.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area.
   C.   The floodplain administrator or city manager, as applicable, may
approve certain development in zones A or AE delineated on the Delaware County
FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than
one foot (1'), provided that the applicant for the development permit in that
case first complies with 44 CFR section 65.12. (Ord. 599, 6-1-2010)
12-514: VARIANCES:
   A.   General provisions:
      1.   The city of Grove board of adjustments may grant variances for uses
which do not satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma floodplain management act
or this chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof
that: a) compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and
unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the
people and b) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section. However, no
variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit
the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
      2.   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma floodplain
management act or by other laws of the state.
      3.   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
twenty (20) years.
      4.   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the board
of adjustment, accompanied by a filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
      5.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 12-513B of
this chapter and provisions of this section have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
      6.   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the chairman of the board of
adjustments which states that: a) the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to
be built lower than the base flood elevation, and b) such construction below
the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
      7.   At such time as the city deems the petition ready for notification
to the public, the board of adjustment shall schedule a hearing and direct the
applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in
Delaware County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing.
      8.   The board of adjustment shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section.
The board of adjustment shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities
involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the
public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
      9.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and
         d.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      10.   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the
intent of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to
the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives stated in section
12-502 of this chapter.
      11.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance issued by the board of adjustment shall be sent by the floodplain
administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of
the variance.
   B.   Special provisions:
      1.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      4.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
         a.   The criteria of subsections A5, A9, B2, and B3 of this section
are met, and
         b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 599, 6-1-2010)
12-515: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for
all new construction and substantial improvements:
   A.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or

shall nevertheless keep in line or follow a straight course as nearly as
practical and shall not weave in and out or turn from side to side
unnecessarily. Vehicles shall move to the right or left only as necessary in

ascertained that such movement can be made safely and has signalled for a
change of course.
   C.   Upon a roadway which has been divided into three (3) lanes, a vehicle
shall not be driven in the center lane except when overtaking and passing
another vehicle where the roadway is clearly visible and such center lane is
clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation for a left turn, or
where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving
in the direction the vehicle is proceeding and is signposted to give notice of
such allocation.
   D.   Official signs may be erected directing slow-moving traffic to use a

lawful traffic movement shall be placed at every intersection where movement of
traffic in the opposite direction is prohibited.

In the event there is no crosswalk, the driver shall stop at a clearly marked
stop line before entering the intersection. If there is no marked stop line,
then the driver shall stop at the point nearest the intersecting road where the
driver has a view of approaching traffic on an intersecting roadway before
entering the intersection. A driver after having stopped shall yield the right-
of-way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway
or road, or which is approaching so close as to constitute immediate hazard;
but the driver having so yielded may then proceed and the driver of all other
vehicles approaching the intersection shall yield the right-of-way to the
vehicle so proceeding. (Prior Code, Chapter 20)
15-552: VEHICLE ENTERING YIELD INTERSECTION:
The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in observance to such

if necessary and shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian legally
crossing the roadway on which he is driving and to any vehicle in the
intersection or approaching on another road so closely as to constitute an
immediate hazard. The driver having so yielded may then proceed and drivers of
all other vehicles approaching the intersection shall yield to the vehicle so
proceeding. A driver who enters a yield intersection without stopping and has
or causes a collision with a pedestrian at a crosswalk or a vehicle in the
intersection shall prima facie be considered not to have yielded as required
herein. The provisions of this section shall not release the drivers of other
vehicles approaching the intersection at such a distance as not to constitute
immediate hazard from the duty to drive with due care to avoid a collision. The
driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign if required for safety to stop
shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection
before entering the intersection; if there is no crosswalk, the driver shall
stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if there is no stop line, then at the
point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of
approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. (Prior Code, Chapter 20)

the curb and into the line of traffic. The vehicle shall in no event enter the
line of traffic until the driver has ascertained that no hazard exists. (Prior
Code, Chapter 20)
15-555: EMERGING FROM THE ALLEY, DRIVEWAY, OR BUILDING:

15-605: TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND:
The display of signal lights, arrows and words shall be deemed to have the
following meanings and requires the appropriate response on the part of
vehicular traffic and pedestrians:
      1.   Green alone, "Go":
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless an official sign at such
place prohibits such turn, but any vehicle and any pedestrian lawfully within
the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal displays green
shall have the right-of-way over such vehicular traffic; and
         b.   Pedestrian traffic, facing a green signal may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless a "walk" signal
indicator is operating;
      2.   Steady yellow or amber alone, "Caution":
         a.   The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute
a warning that the "Red" or "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately
thereafter; and
         b.   Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near
side crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so
near the limit line when the "caution" signal first flashes that a stop cannot
be made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the
intersection and clear the same before the "red" signal flashes;
      3.   Red alone, "Stop":
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk and shall remain standing until green or "go" is shown alone.
Except where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns, vehicles in the
right traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may enter the
intersection cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield
the right-of-way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection and
the turn shall be made so as not to interfere in any way with traffic
proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street; and
         b.   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the
roadway when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal
indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety.
No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or
"go" is shown alone unless authorized to do so, by a pedestrian "walk" signal;
      4.   Steady red with green arrow:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic
lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated
by the arrow, but shall yield the right- of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the
movement indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be
made only on the red with green arrow signal; and
         b.   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until
the green or "go" is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian
"walk" signal; and
      5.   Green arrows alone. Whenever vehicular traffic movements are
controlled by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal
indication, vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by
the green arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are
displayed.
(Prior Code, Chapter 20)
State Law Reference: Similar provisions, 47 O.S. Section 11-202.
15-606: PEDESTRIANS; SIGNAL INDICATORS; REGULATIONS:
Special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "Walk," "Wait" or
"Don't Walk" shall regulate pedestrian movement as follows:
      1.   "Walk." Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the
roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by
the drivers of all vehicles; and
      2.   "Wait" or "Don't Walk." No pedestrian shall start to cross the
roadway in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially
completed his crossing on the "Walk" signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or
safety zone while the "Wait" signal is showing.
(Prior Code, Chapter 20)
15-607: FLASHING SIGNALS:
   A.   Whenever a flashing red or yellow signal is illuminated, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
      1.   "Flashing Red." When a red light is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject
to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign; and
      2.   "Flashing Yellow." When a yellow light is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection,
or pass such signal only with caution.
   B.   This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. (Prior Code,
Chapter 20)
State Law Reference: Similar provisions, 47 O.S. Section 11-204.
15-608: PEDESTRIAN-ACTIVATED SCHOOL CROSSING SIGNALS:
Whenever a pedestrian-activated school crossing signal is provided, it requires
obedience by vehicular traffic and pedestrians as follows:
      1.   "Flashing yellow":
         a.   When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers or operators of vehicles may proceed through the intersection
or pass such signal only with caution; and
         b.   Pedestrians shall not proceed in conflict with traffic, but may
activate the signal control switch, and shall wait until steady red alone is
shown before entering the roadway or intersection controlled by the signal;
      2.   "Steady yellow alone":
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
red of "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such
vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection or pass the
signal when the red or "Stop" signal is exhibited; and
         b.   No pedestrian shall enter the roadway or intersection on which
the signal controls vehicular traffic until steady red alone is shown;
      3.   "Steady red":
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and shall remain standing
until flashing yellow is shown alone;
         b.   Pedestrians may proceed across the road controlled by the signal,
and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles; and
