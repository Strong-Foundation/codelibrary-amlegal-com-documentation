ground to allow solid waste, including, but not limited to trash or debris that
is susceptible to being blown or scattered by wind, to accumulate thereon so as
to emit an offensive odor, to become unsightly, or to become injurious or
dangerous to the health of the neighborhood or any inhabitant thereof. It shall
further be unlawful to allow trash or debris to be dispersed or blown onto the
same property, adjacent properties, public rights-of-way, or common areas. To
prevent the accumulation and dispersal of refuse, all solid waste placed in any
refuse collection facility, including polycarts and dumpsters, shall be
securely bagged. Loose trash or debris shall not be deposited directly into any
such container. This requirement shall not apply to grease storage receptacles.
      2.   Violations of this chapter shall be considered a public nuisance and
punishable as such, and may be abated as such.
   B.   Construction Sites:
      1.   Any person constructing any structure within the Cit of Elgin shall,
prior to construction on any premises, furnish and place on said premises a
container of suitable size and design to contain all solid waste which might,
by the winds or elements, be distributed and blown from the premises. Said
container shall be used by the person concerned at all times to keep the
premises from becoming unsightly with solid waste, and shall always be kept
covered. Removal and disposal of all construction debris shall be the
responsibility of the individual holding the building permit.
      2.   Any person who fails to keep the premises on which any structure is
being built or installed free from solid waste and who allows said waste to
blow or be carried from the premises to adjoining or other property or into the
streets shall be deemed guilty of causing a nuisance, and shall be subject to
the penalties in this code prescribed therefor.
   C.   Lids For Dumpsters: All dumpsters used for the collection of solid
waste in the City of Elgin shall have lids to prevent blowing trash originating
from the dumpsters. If the dumpster was manufactured for a lid, the lid shall
be of a design at least similar to the original. As a minimum, each lid shall
be sufficient to keep trash, paper and other debris from blowing out of
the dumpster under windy conditions.
D. Screening Standards and Specifications for Dumpsters (Refuse Collection
Facility):
1. Each refuse collection facility shall be enclosed on three sides (two sides
and a rear) with opaque screening such that the refuse collection facility is
not visible from the street or adjacent properties. The open side shall face
away from public view to the maximum extent practicable.
2. All screening used to comply with the requirements of this article shall
have a height equal to or greater than the height of the refuse collection
facility screened, and shall otherwise comply with all requirements of this
article.
3. Screening fences shall be constructed of conventional, opaque fencing
materials. Acceptable screening fences include, but are not limited to, solid
wood fences made of treated pine, cedar or redwood, or masonry walls.
Unacceptable materials include, but are not limited to, plywood, corrugated
steel sheets, and chain link fences with weave. All required fences shall be
maintained in good condition.
4. If there is no alternative for the orientation of the refuse collection
facility other than where the open front is clearly visible from the street or
adjacent properties, then an opaque gate with the same height as the enclosure
shall be required.
5. Solid vegetative screens may be utilized only as a supplemental measure and
shall not substitute for the required three-sided enclosure. Where used, the
vegetative screen shall have a minimum height of three feet at the time of
installation and a minimum height of six feet at the time of maturity, and must
be in compliance with Subsection A of this section.
6. The use of unconventional opaque fencing materials may be used to satisfy
the requirements of this article if the fencing materials so authorized match
existing or proposed building facades.
7. Refuse collection facilities shall be located in the rear 50 percent of the
lot on which they are located.
8. This ordinance does not apply to polycarts.
E. Compliance Upon Remodeling or Site Improvement:
Any business that undergoes remodeling, expansion, site improvements or
otherwise obtains a building permit, and maintains a refuse collection facility
(dumpster) on the premises shall be required to bring the refuse collection
facility into full compliance with the screening standards and specifications
set forth in Subsection D above. Compliance shall be completed prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
F. Grease Storage Receptacles:
Shall be subject to the same location, screening, and maintenance requirements
as refuse collection facilities, and must be installed and maintained in a
manner that prevents spills, runoff, odor, and pest attraction. All such
containers shall be enclosed or shielded from public view and shall not be
located in any manner that constitutes a fire hazard or violation of applicable
building or environmental codes.
G. Owner and Operator Responsibility:
Both the owner of the property and the operator of any business utilizing
refuse collection facilities shall be jointly and severally responsible for
ensuring compliance with all requirements of this section, including but not
limited to the proper placement, maintenance, and containment of refuse. A
violation by either party shall be deemed a violation of this chapter with a
penalty as set forth in Section 8-4-7.
SECTION 3. That the remaining portions of Title 8 shall be unchanged by this
ordinance.
SECTION 4. Repealer. All ordinances or parts thereof which are inconsistent
with this ordinance are repealed upon the effective date of this ordinance.

not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance.

1-9-8: TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS; PROCEDURES:
   A.   Conditions For Release For Traffic Violations: If a police officer
observes facts which he believes constitute a violation of the traffic
ordinances of the City committed by any person, whether a resident of this
State or a nonresident, who is arrested by a law enforcement officer solely for
a violation of a Municipal traffic ordinance, such person shall be released by
the arresting officer upon personal recognizance if:
      1.   The arrested person has been issued a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle by Oklahoma, another state jurisdiction within the United States,
or any party jurisdiction of the nonresident violator compact.
      2.   The arresting officer is satisfied as to the identity of the
arrested person. (1991 Code § 11-12)
      3.   The arrested person signs a written promise to appear as provided
for on the citation, unless the person is unconscious or injured and requires
immediate medical treatment as determined by a treating physician. (1991 Code §
11-12; amd. 2013 Code)
      4.   The violation does not constitute:
         a.   A felony;
         b.   Negligent homicide; (1991 Code § 11-12)
         c.   Driving or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle
while impaired or under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicating

or a duly designated delegate:
         a.   Designate the traffic charge;

   C.   Continue Or Reschedule Arraignment: The court, or the court clerk, as

arraignment upon request of the arrested person or his attorney. If the
arraignment is continued or rescheduled, the arrested person shall remain on

and signed by the defendant. An arraignment may be continued or rescheduled
more than one time; provided, however, that the court shall require an
arraignment to be had within a reasonable time. It shall remain the duty of the

commercial money order, or other form of payment approved by the court in an
amount prescribed as bail for the offense; provided, however, that the

subsection, such plea shall be accepted by the court and the amount of the fine
and costs shall be as prescribed in section
1-9-20 of this chapter as bail for the violation.
   E.   Failure To Appear; Warrant; License Suspension:
      1.   If, pursuant to the provisions of subsection D of this section, the

court clerk, within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days from the date the
citation was issued by the arresting officer, shall notify the state department
of public safety that:
         a.   The defendant was issued a traffic citation and released upon
personal recognizance after signing a written promise to appear for arraignment
as provided for in the citation;
         b.   The defendant has failed to appear for arraignment without good

suspension of the defendant's driver's license in accordance with the
provisions of the nonresident violator compact. Such notice and request shall
be on a form approved or furnished by the state department of public safety.
The court clerk shall not process the notification and request provided for in
this subsection if, with respect to such charges:
         a.   The defendant was arraigned, posted bail, paid a fine, was
jailed, or otherwise settled the case; or
         b.   The defendant was not released upon personal recognizance upon a

released, was not permitted to remain on such personal recognizance for
arraignment; or
         c.   The violation related to parking or standing, an overweight

suspension submitted to the state department of public safety pursuant to the
provisions of this section. When the court or court clerk receives appropriate
bail or payment of the fine and costs, settles the citation, makes other
arrangements with the defendant, or otherwise closes the case, the court clerk
shall furnish proof thereof to such defendant, if the defendant personally
appears, or shall mail such proof by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the
defendant at the address noted on the citation, or at such other address as is
furnished by the defendant. Additionally, the court or court clerk shall notify
the home jurisdiction of the defendant, as listed on the citation, if such
jurisdiction is a member of the nonresident violator compact, and shall, in all
other cases, notify the department of the resolution of the case. The form of
proof and the procedures for notification shall be approved by the state
department of public safety; provided, however, that the court or court clerk's
failure to furnish such proof or notice in the manner provided for in this
subsection shall in no event create any civil liability upon the court, the
court clerk, the state of Oklahoma or any political subdivision thereof, or any
state department or agency, or employee thereof, but duplicate proof shall be
furnished to the person entitled thereto, upon request.
   G.   Residents, Issuance Of Citation: If a resident of the city is arrested
by a law enforcement officer for the violation of any traffic ordinance for
which subsections A through F of this section do not apply, the officer shall
immediately release said person if the person acknowledges receipt of a
citation by signing it; provided, however, that the arresting officer need not
release said person if it reasonably appears to the officer that the person may
cause injury to himself or others, or damage to property if released, that the

not of record may be assessed for failure of a person to have a valid driver's
license, when charged with a traffic violation.
      2.   If a nonresident of the city is arrested by a law enforcement
officer for a violation of any ordinance for which subsections A through F of
this section do not apply, the defendant shall be eligible to be admitted to
bail either before or after arraignment.
      3.   The amount and conditions of bail granted pursuant to the provisions
of subsections G, H1, and H2 of this section shall be determined by the judge
who shall prescribe rules for the receipt of bail and for the release on
personal recognizance. In the event of arrests at night, emergencies, or when
the judge is not available, a court official, the chief of police or his
designated representative may be authorized by the judge, subject to such
conditions as shall be prescribed by the judge, to accept a temporary cash bond
in a sufficient amount to secure the appearance of the accused. The cash bond
shall not exceed the maximum fine provided for by ordinance for each offense
charged. The court official, chief of police or his designated representative
is authorized, subject to such conditions as shall be prescribed by the judge,
to release a resident of the city on personal recognizance.

recognizance as provided for in subsections A through G of this section, or is
eligible but refuses to sign a written promise to appear, the officer shall
deliver the person to an appropriate magistrate for arraignment and the
magistrate shall proceed as otherwise provided for by law. If no magistrate is
available, the defendant shall be placed in the custody of the appropriate
municipal jailer or custodian, to be held until a magistrate is available, or
bail is posted as provided for by ordinance before or after arraignment.
   J.   Overweight Or Hazardous Materials Violation: If a resident or
nonresident is arrested for any overweight violation, a violation of a special
permit exceeding authorized permit weight, or a violation relating to the
transportation of hazardous material, the arresting officer may release the

or payment of the fine and costs in an amount and in the form as provided for
in section
1-9-20 of this chapter, except currency.
   K.   Additional Violation: In the event the defendant is additionally

      2.   Place any other traffic offender into custody:
         a.   Who is injured, disabled or otherwise incapacitated; or
         b.   Whose custodial arrest may require impoundment of a vehicle
containing livestock, perishable cargo or items requiring special maintenance
or care; or
         c.   Where, if extraordinary circumstances exist in the judgment of
the arresting officer, custodial arrest should not be made.
      3.   In such cases, the arresting officer may designate the date and time
for arraignment on the citation and release the person. If the person fails to
appear without good cause shown, the court may issue a warrant for the person's
arrest.
      4.   The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to:
         a.   Create any duty on the part of the officer to release a person
from custody;
         b.   Create any duty on the part of the officer to make any inquiry or
investigation relating to any condition which may justify release under this
subsection; or

program. Investments of the City shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to

market average rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking
into account the City's investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio.

investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a
specific cash flow, the City of Elgin will not directly invest in securities
maturing more than three (3) years from the date of purchase.
   F.   To the extent practicable, the City of Elgin shall utilize a system of
competitive bidding in the investment of Municipal funds.
      1.   Before investments of surplus funds are placed, a competitive
telephone, or electronic “bid” process (consisting of quoted interest or yield
rates, dollar prices, or discount rates) shall be conducted. Certificates of
deposit will be bid among approved depository banking institutions, while other
investment instruments will be bid among security dealers approved by the City
Council. Bids will be secured from at least three (3) institutions, if
possible. Bidders are required to bid a firm price or yield, which will remain
effective for a reasonable period of time (approximately 30 minutes), given
market fluctuations, to allow further bids to be received. Typically, awards
will be made to the bidder offering the highest effective yield consistent with
policy restrictions; however, transaction costs, diversification requirements,
and other factors may be considered when awarding investments such as
maintaining a local presence. (Ord. 18-09, 10-9-2018; amd. Ord. 21-32, 7-13-

3-6-2: State Department Of Health Regulations Adopted
3-6-3: Definitions
3-6-1: LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   The intent of this chapter is to ensure the health and safety of all
Oklahomans and provide reasonable and orderly regulation of medical marijuana
as authorized by the lawful passage of State Question 788. Only the powers
enumerated under this chapter shall be proper. Any power not specifically
enumerated is prohibited.
      1.   Any person, persons, or entity violating any provisions of this
chapter, either by doing anything which is prohibited or by failing to do
anything which is commanded, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall be fined in an amount not exceeding five hundred
dollars ($500.00), plus court costs. Each separate violation of this chapter
shall constitute a separate offense. Where a lesser fine is mandated by State
law then the lesser amount of fine shall be applicable.
      2.   The regulations are intended to apply to all medical marijuana for
personal use or any medical marijuana business permitted under the State
Question 788. The code is intended to provide regulations to limit the impact
that medical marijuana cultivation and production will have on health, safety,
and community resources.
      3.   Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and
transportation of medical marijuana remains illegal under Federal law and
marijuana remains classified as a "controlled substance" by Federal law.
      4.   The regulations for medical marijuana uses are not adequate at the
State level to address the impacts of medical marijuana on the City, making it
appropriate for local regulation of the impacts of medical marijuana uses.
      5.   Nothing in this chapter is intended to promote or condone the
production, distribution, or possession of marijuana in violation of any
applicable law.
      6.   This chapter is to be construed to protect the public over medical
marijuana business interests. Operation of a medical marijuana business is a
revocable privilege and not a right in the City. There is no property right for
an individual or business to have medical marijuana in the City.
      7.   Medical marijuana is a heavily regulated industry in the City and
all permittees are assumed to be fully aware of the law. The City shall not
therefore be required to issue warnings before issuing citations for violations
of this chapter.
   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare of the residents and patients of the City by prescribing the manner
in which medical marijuana businesses can be conducted in the City. Further,
the purpose of this chapter is to:
      1.   Provide for a means of cultivation, production, and distribution of
marijuana to patients who qualify to obtain, possess, and use marijuana for
medical purposes under the State Question 788.
      2.   Protect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on
business operations as they relate to noise, air and water quality, food
safety, neighborhood and patient safety, security for the business and its
personnel, and other health and safety concerns.
      3.   Impose fees to cover the cost to the City of permitting medical
marijuana businesses in an amount sufficient for the City to recover its costs
of the permitting program.
      4.   Adopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of
this chapter.
      5.   Create regulations that address the particular needs of the patients
and residents of the City and coordinate with laws that may be enacted by the
State regarding the issue.
      6.   Facilitate the implementation of State Question 788 without going
beyond the authority granted by it.
      7.   Issue medical marijuana business permits only to individuals and
entities that have demonstrated an intent and ability to comply with this
chapter without monitoring by City officials.
   C.   A commercial medical marijuana business permit issued by the City of
Elgin pursuant to this chapter is issued in accordance with the passage of
State Question 788 and all subsequent Oklahoma Statutes and regulations derived
therefrom. Should State medical marijuana laws change to an extent that an
activity allowed or permitted under this chapter becomes illegal under State
law, or should a court of competent jurisdiction determine Federal laws
concerning the prohibition of medical marijuana supersede the medical marijuana
laws and regulations of the State of Oklahoma, any and all permits issued by
the City to allow a person or entity to perform said activity shall be deemed
to be immediately revoked by operation of law, with no ground for appeal or
other redress on behalf of the permittee. (Ord. 18-07, 10-9-2018)
3-6-2: STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH REGULATIONS ADOPTED:
   A.   Oklahoma State Department of Health Regulations, title 310, chapter
681, Medical Marijuana Control Program as it may from time to time be amended
is adopted by reference and is made a part of the ordinances of the City, as if
fully set forth in this Code. The provisions of these regulations shall take
effect and be controlling within the City limits so that a violation of the
provisions of the regulations will be a violation of this Code. Nothing in this
section shall grant to the City the power or jurisdiction to prosecute offenses
that a City is not authorized to prosecute. Copies of the rules are on file in
the Office of the City Clerk.
   B.   Any crimes specified in the rules or other laws as felonies are
specifically excluded from inclusion in this chapter. (Ord. 18-07, 10-9-2018)
   C.   The penalty for a misdemeanor violation of the rules as adopted by this
chapter shall be a fine in an amount not exceeding five hundred dollars
($500.00), plus court costs. Each separate violation of this chapter shall
constitute a separate offense. Where a lessor fine is mandated by State law,
then the lesser amount of fine shall be applicable. (Ord. 19-02, 5-14-2019)

owner and an opportunity for him to be heard, if this can be done.
   B.   Nuisances Constituting Immediate Danger:
      1.   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or the public generally.
      2.   It is recognized that, in such circumstances, the mayor (or his
representative) may be justified or required to take immediate and proper
action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger
until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement. (1991 Code §
12-20)
   C.   Submission Of Statement Of Nuisance Condition: The fire chief, the
chief of police, the city attorney, the administrative officer, any council
member, any resident of the city, or any other officer subordinate to the city
council, may submit to the city council, a statement as to the existence of a
nuisance as defined by state law or the ordinances of the city, and a request
or recommendation that it be abated. (1991 Code § 12-20; amd. 2013 Code)
   D.   Council Determination; Hearing; Notice:
      1.   The city council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance
is a nuisance in fact, and before proceeding to have the nuisance abated, the
council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner
of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible
for, or to be causing, the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard,
if such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given.
      2.   Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given
in writing by mail or by service (by a police officer), if their names and
addresses are known. If the names and addresses are not known, and the peace,
health, safety, morals or welfare of the person, persons or public adversely
affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of
the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the
city or county.
   E.   Abatement By City; Assessment Of Costs:
      1.   If the city council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it
shall direct the owner and/or other persons responsible for, or causing, the
nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety,
morals or welfare of the person or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
it within the specified time, the city council shall direct the mayor to abate
the nuisance or have it abated, if summary abatement is practical.
      2.   The city clerk-treasurer shall send a statement of the cost of such
summary abatement to the owner and/or other persons responsible for, or
causing, the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names
and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the

   A.   Order Abatement:

condition conducive to the breeding of insects or rodents that might contribute
to the transmission of disease or any other condition adversely affecting the
public health. Failure to do so shall constitute an offense.
      2.   Such order shall be served on the owner or occupant (or his agent)
of the premises by the city administrative officer or county health official,
or a police officer. If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the
owner, occupant or agent is unknown or is without the state, the order may be
served by posting a copy thereof on the premises or by publication in at least
one issue of a newspaper having a general circulation in the city or county.
   B.   Abatement By City; Assessment Of Costs: If the order is not complied
with, the city administrative officer may cause the order to be executed, and
the cost thereof shall be certified to the city clerk-treasurer. The cost of
abating such nuisance shall be added to the city utility bill of the owner or
occupant (if he is a user of any city utility service) and shall become due and
payable and be subject to the same regulations relating to delinquency in
payment as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is not a user of
any city utility service, such costs, after certification to the city clerk-
treasurer, may be collected in any manner in which any other debt due the city
may be collected. (1991 Code § 12-21; amd. 2013 Code)

other. The city council may elect to follow any such procedure which is
applicable in abating any particular nuisance. (1991 Code § 12-8)

Any person who violates any provision of this chapter by doing any act
prohibited, declared to be unlawful thereby or declared to be a nuisance, an
offense or misdemeanor thereby, or who fails to do any act required by any such
provision, who fails to do any act when such provision declares such failure to
be unlawful or to be an offense or misdemeanor, who violates any legal order or
regulation made pursuant to this chapter, or who maintains any nuisance as
defined in this chapter, shall be guilty of an offense and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding the limits established in
section

constitute a separate offense. (1991 Code § 12-30)

   B.   Holding Of Hearing: A hearing shall be held by the city council or its
designated administrative officer to determine if the property is dilapidated
and has become detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the general
public and the community, or if the property creates a fire hazard which is
dangerous to other property.
   C.   Tearing Down Or Removal By City; Cost; Lien:
      1.   Pursuant to a finding that the condition of the property constitutes
a detriment or a hazard and that the property would be benefited by the removal
of such conditions, the city council or its designated administrative officer
may cause the dilapidated building to be torn down and removed.
      2.   The city council or its designated administrative officer shall fix
reasonable dates for the commencement and completion of the work.

personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date of filing of
the notice.
      4.   The agents of the city are granted the right of entry on the
property for the performance of the necessary duties as a governmental function
of the city if the work is not performed by the property owner within dates
fixed by the city council or its designated administrative officer.

costs to any property owner or mortgage holder, the city shall obtain a receipt
of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of

      3.   If the city dismantles or removes any dilapidated buildings, the
cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor,
maintenance, and equipment required for the dismantling and removal of the
dilapidated buildings.
      4.   If dismantling and removal of the dilapidated buildings is done on a
private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best
bidder.
   E.   Payment Of Costs; Lien; Remedial Action:
      1.   When payment is made to the city for costs incurred, the city clerk-
treasurer shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to the
actual cost of the dismantling and removal of the buildings is not made within

such property, the city clerk-treasurer shall forward a certified statement of
the amount of the cost to the county treasurer of the county in which the

lien against the property from the date the notice of the lien is filed with
the county clerk.

other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and superior to all

4-1B-2: Cleaning Of Trash And Weeds
4-1B-3: Boarding And Securing, Procedure
4-1B-4: Exception
4-1B-1: AUTHORIZATION:
After a building has been declared dilapidated, as provided in article A of
this chapter, and before the commencement of the tearing down and removal of a
dilapidated building, the city council or its designated administrative officer
may authorize that such a building be boarded and secured. However, if the
dilapidated building is vacant and unfit for human occupancy, the city council
or its designated administrative officer may authorize the structure to be
demolished pursuant to article A of this chapter. (Ord. 12-04, 8-23-2012)
4-1B-2: CLEANING OF TRASH AND WEEDS:
The city council or its designated administrative officer may cause the
premises on which an unsecured building is located to be cleaned of trash and
weeds in accordance with the provisions of article C of this chapter. (Ord. 12-
04, 8-23-2012)
4-1B-3: BOARDING AND SECURING, PROCEDURE:
The city council or its designated administrative officer may cause an
unsecured building to be boarded and secured in accordance with the following
procedure:
   A.   Notice Of Action:
      1.   Before the city council or its designated administrative officer
orders such action, at least ten (10) days' notice that such unsecured building
is to be boarded and secured shall be given by mail to any property owners and
mortgage holders as provided in article A of this chapter. At the time of
mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage holder, the city shall
obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall
indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. A copy of
the notice shall also be posted on the property to be affected.
      2.   However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be
located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property or
by publication as defined in 11 Oklahoma Statutes section 1-102. Such notice
shall be published one time, not less than ten (10) days prior to any hearing
or action by the city pursuant to the provisions of this article.
      3.   If the city council or its designated administrative officer
anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance, the notice shall state: that any
subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six (6) month
period after the initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant to such
notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the city council or its
designated administrative officer; that the costs of such boarding and securing
shall be assessed against the owner; and that a lien may be imposed on the
property to secure such payment, all without further prior notice to the
property owner or mortgage holder.
   B.   Written Consent Of Property Owner: The owner of the property may give
written consent to the city authorizing the boarding and securing of such
unsecured building and to the payment of any costs incurred thereby. By giving
written consent, the owner waives any right the owner has to a hearing by the
city council or its designated administrative officer.
   C.   Holding Of Hearing:
      1.   If the property owner does not give written consent to such actions,
a hearing may be held by the city council or its designated administrative
officer to determine whether the boarding and securing of such unsecured
building would promote and benefit the public health, safety or welfare. Such
hearing may be held in conjunction with a hearing on the accumulation of trash
or the growth of weeds or grass on the premises of such unsecured building held
pursuant to the provisions of article C of this chapter.
      2.   In making such determination, the city council or its designated
administrative officer shall apply the following standard: the city council or
its designated administrative officer may order the boarding and securing of
the unsecured building when the boarding and securing thereof would make such
building less available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard
created by such building, or decrease the hazard that such building would
constitute an attractive nuisance to children.
      3.   Upon making the required determination, the city council or its
designated administrative officer may order the boarding and securing of the
unsecured building.
   D.   Filing Notice Of Lien With County: After the city council or its
designated administrative officer orders the boarding and securing of such
unsecured building, the city clerk-treasurer shall immediately file a notice of
unsecured building and lien with the county clerk describing the property,
stating the findings of the city council at the hearing at which such building
was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the city claims a lien on the
property for the costs of boarding and securing such building and that such
costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date
of filing the notice.
   E.   Right Of Entry Upon Property: Pursuant to the order of the city council
or its designated administrative officer, the agents of the city are granted
the right of entry on the property for the performance of the boarding and
securing of such building and for the performance of all necessary duties as a
governmental function of the city.
   F.   Cost Determination; Statement To Property Owner:
      1.   After an unsecured building has been boarded and secured, the city
council or its designated administrative officer shall determine the actual

(6:00) A.M., the following day. (Ord. 11-8-94, 11-8-1994)
5-5A-3: EXCEPTIONS:
In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a public street during the
nocturnal hours for which sections
5-5A-2 of this article is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation,
shall not, however, be considered in violation:
   A.   When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
   B.   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor, to
take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of
time and purpose, within a specified area.
   C.   When exercising first amendment rights protected by the United States
constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by
processing a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned by a
parent of such minor, with their home address and telephone number, specifying
when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night, in
the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication.
   D.   In case of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in said
minor's possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned
by a parent of such minor, evidencing their home address and telephone number,
and establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets, at a
designated time, for a described purpose, including points of origin and
destination.
   E.   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next door neighbor where said neighbor
does not communicate an objection to the police officer.
   F.   When returning home by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes of
the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or
voluntary association; provided, that the minor has a written communication, in
the minor's possession, countersigned by the parent, indicating the home
address and telephone number, the purpose for the event, when, where and in
what manner said minor will be on the streets at night.
   G.   When authorized, by a regulation issued by the city council, in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled, but adapted to
necessary nighttime activities, or more minors than can readily be dealt with
on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the city
council permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance
to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies,
such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
streets permitted, the period of time involved (not to extend more than 30
minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity), and the reason for
finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and consistent with the
public interest and the purposes of this article.
   H.   When the minor carries a certified card of employment, briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and his place of employment,
and his hours of employment, or carries a valid proof of employment which may
include the latest payroll receipt, not over thirty (30) days old.
   I.   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel and clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement
through the city, particularly on normal routes. (Ord. 11-8-94, 11-8-1994)
5-5A-4: PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY:
It shall be unlawful for a parent, having legal custody of a minor, to
knowingly permit, or by inefficient control to allow, such minor to be, or
remain upon, any public street under circumstances not constituting an
exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this article. The term
"knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to
have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It
is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a
reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective
test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely
indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. (Ord.
11-8-94, 11-8-1994)
5-5A-5: PROCEDURE UPON APPREHENSION BY POLICE:
   A.   Apprehension; Notify Parent: A police officer of the city, upon finding
or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation
of this article, normally shall take the minor to the Elgin police station, or
other place designated by the chief of police, where a parent shall immediately
be notified to come for such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This
is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of
relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the personnel then on duty
for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and recording,
thus making available to experienced supervisory personnel, the best of
facilities and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing
evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall, in
the first instance, use his best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Refining Of Police Procedures: Police procedures shall constantly be
refined in the light of experience, and may provide, inter alia, that the
police officer may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate
circumstances; for example, a minor of tender age, near home, whose identity
may readily be ascertained or are known.
   C.   Filing Of Report: In any event, such police officer shall, within
twenty four (24) hours, file a written report with the chief of police, or
shall participate to the extent of the information for which he is responsible.
Said report shall be treated for purposes of juvenile records in accordance
with state statutes. (Ord. 11-8-94, 11-8-1994)
5-5A-6: RELEASE FROM CUSTODY:
When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor, and
the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to
the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or fails to take
charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the juvenile
authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations,
approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may temporarily be
entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will, on behalf of a
parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the
availability or arrival of a parent. (Ord. 11-8-94, 11-8-1994)

CHAPTER 2
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
10-2-1: Definitions
10-2-2: Review Development Proposals; Requirements
10-2-3: Floodplain Variance Board Of Appeals
10-2-1: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. These words and
terms shall also be consistent with the similarly used words and terms in the
zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations ordinance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH or VO zone on the community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3'), where
a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within the community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a building
in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the
elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE or V, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor or the water; and b) adequately anchored
so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of
up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99,
AO, AH, B, C, X and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30,
VE or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls, if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section
60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program (NFIP) regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of the city on which the
federal emergency management agency (FEMA) has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to said community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood hazard boundary-floodway maps.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal
water, or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from
any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated and expended, and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HABITABLE FLOOR: Any floor usable for the following purposes, including
working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation areas, or a combination
thereof. A floor used for storage purposes only is not a "habitable floor".
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program (NFIP) regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: Shall be as defined in section
10-4-2 of this title (definition of Manufactured Housing).
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program (NFIP),
the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which
base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM)
are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of the
floodplain management regulations adopted by the city.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or
other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement or permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation of basements, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: A. Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
          1. Before the improvement or repair is started; or
          2. If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred.
         For the purpose of this definition "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.
         B. The term does not, however, include either:
          1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
          2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or the state register of historic places.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this code,
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (1991 Code § 4-90)
10-2-2: REVIEW DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS; REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Commission And Council Review: The planning commission and the city
council shall review subdivision and other development proposals to determine
whether such proposals will be safe from flooding.
   B.   Requirements For Development: If a subdivision or other development
proposal is in a flood prone area, the planning commission and the city council
shall ensure that:
      1.   Such proposals are consistent with the community's adopted
comprehensive plan and the need to minimize flood damage;
      2.   All public utilities and facilities are located and constructed to
avoid, minimize or eliminate flood damage;
      3.   Adequate drainage provisions are made; and
      4.   Proposals of more than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres shall
include 100-year flood elevation data. (1991 Code § 4-90)
10-2-3: FLOODPLAIN VARIANCE BOARD OF APPEALS:
   A.   Zoning Board Of Adjustment Serve As Variance Board: The zoning board of
adjustment shall also serve as the appeals board to hear and render judgment on
requests for variances from the requirements of floodplain management
regulations.
   B.   Hearings Concerning Errors: The appeals board shall hear and render
judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any
requirement, decision or determination made by the building inspector in the
enforcement or administration of the city's floodplain management regulations.
   C.   Appeal To Court: Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeals
board may appeal such decision in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   D.   Record Of Actions; Report To FEMA: The building inspector shall
maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances
to the federal emergency management agency (FEMA), upon request.
   E.   Granting Variances; Conditions:
      1.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state register of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
      2.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size,
contiguous to, and surrounded by, lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided all relevant factors have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      3.   Upon consideration of all factors noted above, the appeals board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purpose and objectives of the city's floodplain management program.
      4.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   F.   Prerequisites For Granting Variances: Prerequisites for granting
variances shall include the following:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. (1991 Code § 1-46)
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon: a) showing a good and
sufficient cause; b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant; and c) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, the creation
of nuisances, fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances. (1991 Code § 1-46; amd. 2013 Code)
      3.   Any applicant for whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      4.   Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use; provided, that: a) the criteria outlined in this
code are met; and b) the structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety. (1991 Code § 1-46)

such as the pouring of footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. For
a structure without a basement or poured footings, the "start of construction"
includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part
thereof on its pilings or foundation, or the affixing of any prefabricated
structure or mobile home on its permanent site. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, land clearing, grading or filling, excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations, erection of temporary forms, the

because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographic condition
of the property, compliance would result in a particular hardship upon the
owner, as distinguished from an inconvenience or a desire to make more money.
VESTED RIGHT: A right which has become absolute and fixed, and cannot be denied
by subsequent changes in conditions or regulations. For example, there is no

district classification given the property.
YARD: A space at grade between the principal building and adjoining lot lines.

has its least dimension. On both corner and interior lots, the rear yard shall
in all cases be at the opposite end of the lot from the front yard.
YARD, SIDE: A space at grade between the main structure and the side line of
the lot and extending from the front lot line to the rear lot line and being
the minimum horizontal distance between a side lot line and the side of the
main building or any projections other than steps and two foot (2') eaves.
ZERO LOT LINE: A development approach in which a building may be sited on one
or more lot lines (conceivably 3 of the 4 sides of the building could be on the
lot lines), in order to allow more flexibility in site design and to increase
the amount of usable open space on the lot.
ZONING ORDINANCE: The officially adopted zoning ordinance of the City. (Ord.
13-09, 7-9-2013; amd. Ord. 17-06, 9-12-2017; Ord. 24-11, 11-12-2024)

constructed, altered, converted, maintained or used in violation of this title,
the City, in addition to other remedies available, may institute any proper
action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful activities, in order to

narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of
the original adoption of the regulations, or by reason of exceptional
topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or
condition peculiar to a specific piece of property, the strict application of
this title would result in undue hardship to the owner of such property, the
board of adjustment is hereby empowered to authorize, upon an appeal relating
to such property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such
difficulties of hardship, but may establish such requirements relative to such
property as would carry out the purpose and intent of this title. The variance,
if granted, must be the minimum necessary to alleviate the unnecessary
hardship.
      3.   Powers Relative To Exceptions: Upon appeal, the board of adjustment

   A.   Map Adopted: The city is hereby divided into zoning districts, as shown
on the official zoning district map, which, together with all explanatory
matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this title as fully as if the same were set forth herein in detail.
B. District Boundary Changes: If, in accordance with the provisions of this
title, changes are made in zoning district boundaries or other matter depicted
on the official zoning district map, such changes shall be made on the official
zoning district map within ten (10) days after the amendment has been approved
by the city council, together with an entry on said map, made by the city
clerk-treasurer, as follows: "Change number            , on  (date) , Ordinance
Number        ".
   C.   Map Changes: No changes of any nature shall be made in the official
zoning district map or matter shown thereon, except in conformity with the
procedures set forth in this title.
   D.   Maintenance Of Official Map: The official zoning district map shall be
maintained as the final authority as to the current zoning district status of
land and water areas, buildings and other structures within the city; however,
the city clerk-treasurer and the chairman of the planning commission may also
each maintain an individual zoning district atlas, reflecting the current
zoning district status of all land within the city, as shown on the official
zoning district map.
   E.   Adopting New Map:
      1.   In the event that the official zoning district map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of
changes and additions, the city council may, by resolution, adopt a new
official zoning district map which shall supersede the prior official zoning
district map.
      2.   The new official zoning district map shall include amendments and
may correct drafting or other errors or omissions, but no such corrections
shall have the effect of amending the original zoning ordinance or altering any
subsequent amendments thereof.
      3.   The prior official map shall be placed in a city file by the city
clerk-treasurer. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)

lines or extensions thereof. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of
districts as shown on the official zoning districts map, the following rules
shall apply:
      1.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
      2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
      3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following corporate boundary
lines shall be construed as following corporate boundary lines.
      4.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be the centerline of the right of way, or, if no centerline is established,
the boundary shall be interpreted to be midway between the right of way lines
of such railroad.
      5.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or extensions of, features
indicated in subsections A1 and A2 of this section shall be so construed.
Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning district map shall
be determined by the scale of the map.
      6.   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by
official action, or whenever such area is franchised for building purposes, the
zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or other public way
shall be automatically extended to the centerline of such vacated street, alley
or way and all areas so involved shall then and henceforth be subject to all
regulations of the extended districts.
   B.   Temporary Zoning Classification:
      1.   Where physical features on the ground are at variance with
information shown on the official zoning district map, or when there arises a
question as to how or whether a parcel of property is zoned and such question
cannot be resolved by the application of subsections A1 through A6 of this
section, the property shall be considered as classified A-1 agricultural-
residential district, temporarily, in the same manner as provided for newly
annexed territory.
      2.   The issuance of a building permit and the determination of permanent
zoning shall be in accordance with the provisions providing for amendments to
the zoning ordinance and official zoning district map. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)
11-3-4: ZONING OF ANNEXED TERRITORY:
   A.   A-1 Designation: All territory hereinafter annexed to the city shall be
automatically classified as A-1 agricultural-residential district, except as
provided in subsection B of this section.
   B.   Petition For Other Classification: The planning commission or owners or
developers of land annexed to the city may petition the city council for a
zoning district classification other than the A-1 agricultural-residential
district, by following the procedures outlined for "rezoning and amendment
applications" in section
11-4-3 of this title. This process may be initiated at any time subsequent to
the official annexation of the territory, but in all cases:
      1.   The procedures outlined in said section
11-4-3 of this title must be followed; and
      2.   The passage, adoption and publication by the city council of the
ordinance indicating the zoning district classification or change shall not
occur until after the land involved has been officially annexed.
   C.   Permanent Classification: The planning commission shall initiate
action, at the first planning commission meeting following annexation, to place
a permanent zoning district classification on the annexed property. Such action
shall be in accordance with subsection B1 of this section. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-

   A.   Use Authorized: The city council, acting subsequent to review and
recommendation by the planning commission, is hereby authorized to use the
provisions of any of the special districts (R-6 planned residential development
district, or the C-3 planned commercial district) provided in this title,
subject to the conditions listed in this section.
   B.   Purpose: The primary purpose for using such districts shall always be
to provide for, and encourage, flexibility in the design and development of
structures and subdivisions in order to promote the most appropriate use of
land; to facilitate the adequate, efficient and economical provisions of
streets and utilities; and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open
lands.
   C.   Conditions: The conditions under which applications for such projects
will be considered are as follows:
      1.   The owner and developer shall make written application to the city
council, through the planning commission, for the use of a special district.
      2.   The planning commission shall make a written determination that such
application would serve to benefit the city.
      3.   Where such procedure involves lands already zoned for residential
purposes, its application shall result in a permitted number of dwelling units
which shall in no case exceed the number which could be permitted, in the
planning commission's judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots
conforming to the minimum lot size and density requirements of the zoning
ordinance applicable to the district(s) in which such land is situated.
      4.   The proposed site plan, including areas within which structures may
be located, the height and spacing of buildings, open spaces and their
landscaping, off street open and enclosed parking spaces, and streets,
driveways and all other physical features as shown on said plan or otherwise
described, accompanied by a statement setting forth the nature of such
modifications, changes or supplementations of existing zoning district
provisions as are not shown on said site plan, shall be subject to review and
public hearing by the planning commission and the city council, in the same
manner as set forth in section
11-4-3 of this chapter for the consideration of rezoning applications.
      5.   Where a new or unlisted use shall develop, the application shall
contain a statement of facts listing the nature of the use, the amount of
activity involved, type of produce involved (if any), storage requirements,
anticipated employment, transportation requirements (if any), the amount of
noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material or vibration likely to be generated
and the general requirements for public utilities. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)
11-4-5: GROUP HOUSING PROJECTS:
In the case of public group housing projects, in which the application of the
normally used residential district provisions are impractical or inappropriate,
the planning commission may, with the approval of the majority of its members,
review the proposal under the terms and conditions of the R-6 planned
residential development district. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)
11-4-6: SANITARY SEWER SERVICE:
No structure or use in any zoning district shall be erected or initiated which
does not have a connection to the municipal sanitary sewer system, unless and
until the appropriate agency certifies that a septic tank or other approved
disposal system can be installed and operated effectively. As a basis for this
decision, the state department of environmental quality may require such soil
percolation tests as it deems necessary. Such tests are to be made at the
expense of the property owner. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)
11-4-7: STREET ACCESS:

Use of solar energy collectors is subject to the restraints imposed on the
topography within the corporate limits of the city, existing trees and the
zoning district height and setback limitations contained within this title. No
guarantee is hereby given that all property within the corporate limits of the
city is entitled to the use of solar collectors; however, as a general policy,
reasonable care shall be taken to protect the opportunity for the utilization
of solar collectors at all available locations. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)

land and/or structures which are lawful prior to the adoption of this title,
but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
title (or any future amendments thereto).
   B.   Intent: It is the intent of this title to:
      1.   Consider such nonconforming uses to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the zoning districts involved;

In any zoning district in which a lot of record exists at the effective date of
the adoption or amendment of this title, which does not conform in size or area

11-5-3: STRUCTURES:
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of the adoption or

concerning the structure, such structure may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions:
   A.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity;
   B.   Should such structure be destroyed by any means, to an extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement costs at the time of destruction,
it shall not be reconstructed except in accordance with the provisions of this
title; and
   C.   Should such structure be moved for any reason, for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning
district in which it is located after it is moved. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)
11-5-4: USES OF STRUCTURES:
If a lawful use of a structure or of a structure and premises in combination

permitted on review" in this district, it shall consider the impact of the
proposal upon surrounding properties and the potential for increased traffic
upon lower standard residential estates streets. If, in the opinion of said
commission, any proposed use will generate an unreasonable increase in the flow
of traffic into a residential estates development or create situations where
heavier vehicles will use the streets more frequently than under normal use and
conditions, the planning commission shall deny the application. (It is the
intent of this title that all "uses permitted on review" be located on high
standard streets or have access from a major street.) (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)

SECTION:
11-7F-1: Purpose
11-7F-2: Procedures And Standards
11-7F-3: Special Requirements
11-7F-1: PURPOSE:
This special district is intended to accommodate planned, unified developments
incorporating either a single type or a variety of types of residential and
related uses. Such developments may consist of individual lots or common
building sites, but it is not the purpose of this district to allow different,
incompatible uses or a greater dwelling unit density than would otherwise be
allowed in the applicable district. Greater flexibility will be allowed and
encouraged in the design of buildings, yards, courts and trafficways than would
otherwise be possible through strict application of other district regulations
(including the potential use of zero lot lines). In addition, use of this
district is intended to encourage a maximum choice of available residential
units, a pattern of development suited to existing natural features and open
spaces, a creative and more efficient approach to the use of land (resulting
from smaller street and utility networks), and a natural environment with a
distinct character harmoniously related to surrounding development patterns.
(Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)
11-7F-2: PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS:
Land may be rezoned for use as a planned residential development, if the
following procedures and related standards are met:
   A.   Application For Rezone: Application for rezoning of land to the R-
6 planned residential development district shall be submitted in accordance
with the procedures set forth in section
11-4-3 of this title.
   B.   Recommendation; Criteria: Prior to submitting its recommendation, the
planning commission shall review the rezoning proposal using the following
criteria:
      1.   Consistency with the existing comprehensive plan;
      2.   Compatibility of the proposal with existing and future development
in adjacent areas;
      3.   Economic feasibility, especially with respect to the area's housing
market; and
      4.   Compliance with the provisions and standards included in sections
11-7F-3 of this article.
   C.   Plan Changes: Any substantial deviation from the approved development
plan shall constitute a violation of the rezoning approval and must be
resubmitted for review following the same procedures required for the original
plan.
   D.   Time Limit: Construction of the development shall be started within two
(2) years of the date of plan approval by the city council. Failure to begin
within the said two (2) years shall void the development plan and shall cause
the land to revert to the zoning district which existed immediately preceding
the last rezoning, upon appropriate action by the city council. (Ord. 13-09, 7-
9-2013)
11-7F-3: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
Use of the R-6 planned residential development district may be authorized when
all of the following provisions are complied with:
   A.   Minimum Site Size: The minimum size of the site upon which a planned
residential development may be located shall be not less than five (5) acres.
   B.   Design Characteristics: The proposed development shall be planned and
designed as a unified residential area, compatible with existing vegetation,
soils, topography and drainageways. The development shall encourage efficiency
in the street and utility networks and extensive and creative use of open
spaces through flexible design standards. All uses must be permitted uses
(i.e., principal uses, accessory uses or uses permitted on review) in
residential zoning districts. Office commercial uses and structures may be
allowed by the planning commission and city council, if they feel the overall
residential characteristics of the development will not be damaged. Overall
dwelling unit density of the proposed development shall not exceed the density
which would be attained if the same were to be developed using a minimum lot
area of six thousand five hundred (6,500) square feet.
   C.   Development Plan: The applicant shall submit a development plan in
support of his rezoning application for the use of the R-6 planned residential
development district, which plan shall include total acreage, structure
locations, sizes, elevations and floor plans, driveway and parking areas and
dimensions, lot and yard areas and dimensions, a drainage plan, open space and
recreation areas and overall dwelling unit density. Water and sewer plans shall
also be provided, indicating the overall requirements of the development for
appropriate linkage to the municipal water and sewer systems. The development
plan may provide for staged development of the project and shall so indicate on
the plan. A study of the area's housing market shall also be provided, as proof
of the economic feasibility of the proposal.
   D.   Lot Requirements: There shall be no minimum lot size, width height or
setback requirements within the R-6 planned residential development district.
The use of zero lot lines is permitted.
   E.   Off Street Parking: Off street parking requirements shall be the same
as for permitted uses in residential districts, except that they may be met by
the use of common parking facilities. Where office commercial uses and
structures are permitted, the planning commission shall determine the
appropriate number of parking spaces, using existing standards for similar
uses.
   F.   Homes Association: If other satisfactory arrangements for improving,
operating and maintaining streets, common parking and open space areas, drives,
service areas and utilities have not been made with the city, a homes
association shall be provided for and created in accordance with accepted
procedures and financial requirements.
   G.   Subdivision Regulations: The requirements of any existing and future
subdivision regulations shall be met by the applicant for a planned residential
development subsequent to the approval of said applicant's rezoning request.
This shall include the preparation and approval of preliminary and final plats
in developments meeting the definition of a "subdivision" according to said
subdivision regulations. (Ord. 13-09, 7-9-2013)

METES AND BOUNDS: A system of describing and identifying land, by measures
(metes) and direction (bounds), from an identifiable point of reference.
MOBILE HOME: Any single-family dwelling designed for transportation on streets
and highways on its own wheels or on flatbed or other trailers (both highway

permanent chassis, designed to be used by itself or to be incorporated with
similar units on a permanent foundation. The term is intended to apply to major
assemblies and does not include prefabricated subelements incorporated into a
structure at the site. A modular unit will be considered as a permanent,
detached, single-family dwelling unit, and therefore, different from a "mobile
home", if it meets all of the following requirements:
         A. The manufacturer of the unit must certify that the structure is
designed only for erection or installation on a site built permanent
foundation. A "site built permanent foundation" is a system of supports,
including piers, either partially or entirely below grade, which is:
          1. Capable of transferring all loads imposed upon the structure into
soil or bedrock without failure;
          2. Placed at an adequate depth below grade to prevent frost damage;
and

control, and usually considered as a unit for purposes of development.
PEDESTRIANWAY: A right of way dedicated to public use to facilitate pedestrian
access to streets and properties.
PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT: A form of development usually characterized by
a unified site design for a number of housing units, and incorporating such
techniques as clustering structures, providing common open space, density
increases and a mix of building types and land uses. (This permits the planning
of a project and the calculation of densities over the entire development,
rather than on an individual lot by lot basis.)
PLANNING COMMISSION: The municipal planning commission of the city.
PLAT, FINAL: A map of a land subdivision, and any required accompanying
material, prepared in a form suitable for filing of record, with necessary
affidavits, dedications and acceptances, and with complete bearings and

any regulations controlling a subdivision.
RIGHT OF WAY: A strip of land occupied or intended to be occupied by a street,
crosswalk, railroad, road, electric transmission line, oil or gas pipeline,
water main, sanitary or storm sewer main, shade trees or another special use.
The usage of the term "right of way" for land platting purposes shall mean that
every right of way hereafter established and shown on a final plat is to be
separate and distinct from the lots or parcels adjoining such right of way and
not included within the dimensions or areas of such lots or parcels. Rights of
way intended for streets, crosswalks, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm
drains, shade trees or any other use involving maintenance by a public agency
shall be dedicated to public use by the maker of the plat on which such right
of way is established.
ROADWAY: That portion of any street so designated for vehicular traffic; where
curbs are in place, that portion of the street between the curbs.
SEDIMENTATION: Processes that operate at or near the surface of the ground to

collector to the sun, which permits radiation from the sun to impinge directly
on the solar collector.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: The first placement of permanent construction on a site,
such as the pouring of footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. For
a structure without a basement of poured footings, the start of construction
includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part
thereof on its pilings or foundation, or the affixing of any prefabricated
structure or mobile home to its permanent site. Permanent construction does not
include: land preparation, land clearing, grading or filling or excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations; or erection of temporary forms; or
the installation of piling under proposed subsurface footings; or installation
of sewer, gas and water pipes, or electric or other service lines from the
street; or existence on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not a part of the main structure. In
flood hazard areas only, "start of construction" shall include all of the
above.

streets plan and is designed to carry intercity traffic and to relate the
various neighborhoods or residential areas. Major streets shall be classified
as follows:
Limited Access Highway: A freeway or expressway providing a trafficway for

space, into two (2) or more lots, tracts, parcels, sites, areas, units or
plots, any one of which, when divided, has an area of less than ten (10) acres,
for the purpose of transfer of ownership or for development, or the dedication,
vacation or realignment of any public or private right of way easement.
Subdivisions shall be classified as follows:
         A. Major: All subdivisions not classified as minor subdivisions,
including, but not limited to, subdivisions of four (4) or more lots, or any
size subdivision requiring any new street or extension of city facilities, or

12-1-9: EXCEPTIONS TO REGULATIONS:
   A.   Lot Splits: Whenever there is a tract or previously subdivided parcel
of land, under single ownership, which is to be resubdivided into three (3) or
fewer lots, the proposed subdivision may be excepted from the procedural
requirements of this title (i.e., preliminary and final plats are not
required); however, this shall not constitute an exception from the design and
improvement requirements herein contained. These exceptions, or "lot splits",
shall be permitted under the following provisions:
      1.   An accurate survey (in plat format) of the proposed tract, and the
resubdivision thereof, prepared by a land surveyor registered in the state of
Oklahoma, shall be submitted to the planning commission.

extensive replatting be accomplished under this exception. Said lot line
adjustments shall be subject to the following provisions:
      1.   No additional lot shall be created by any lot line adjustment.
      2.   No lot line adjustment shall be allowed unless all required
improvements are either completed and accepted by the city, or their

   B.   Commission Approval: Such an instrument shall be approved by the
planning commission in like manner as plats of subdivisions. The city council
may reject any such instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in
any of its public uses, improvements, streets or alleys.
   C.   Recording Instrument: Such an instrument shall be executed,
acknowledged or approved, and recorded or filed, in like manner as plats of
subdivisions; and being duly recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the
force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated and to divest all
public rights in the streets, alleys, public grounds and all dedications laid
out or described in such plat.
   D.   Sale Of Lots: When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the
manner herein provided, by all of the owners of lots in such plat joining in
the execution of such writing, subsequent to court action as required by
applicable state law. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)

without undue delay to developers. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-1-12: AMENDMENT OF REGULATIONS:
The city council may, from time to time, adopt amendments to this title to the
end that the public is better informed and that the approval and review of
plats is improved and/or expedited. These amendments shall be adopted by the
city council by ordinance, following at least one review hearing by the
planning commission. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-1-13: AGENDA:
   A.   Fulfilling Certain Requirements: Each plat submitted for preliminary or
final review shall be placed on the agenda of the planning commission only
after fulfilling appropriate requirements of this title.
   B.   Request For Specific Exceptions: Any plat not meeting all of the
requirements may be submitted if the subdivider presents, with the plat, a
written request for specific exceptions, and enumerates, in detail, the reasons
therefor; however, the planning commission, after appropriate review of said
request, shall not be bound to continue its review if said request does not
contain adequate reasons for said omissions and a reasonable timetable for
submission of omitted elements. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-1-14: VARIANCES:
   A.   Basis For Findings: Where the planning commission finds that
extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict
compliance with this title and/or the purposes of this title may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these
subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured; provided, that such variance shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this title; and further provided, that the
planning commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area where the
variance is located;
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result (as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience), if the strict letter of this title are carried out; and
      4.   The variances will not in any manner conflict with, or vary from,
the provisions of the adopted zoning ordinance or Elgin community plan.
   B.   Required Conditions: In approving variances, the planning commission
may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements of this title. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-
1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-1-15: CONFLICT WITH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISIONS:
   A.   Public Provisions: The regulations of this title are not intended to
interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation,
statute or other provision of law. Where any provision of this title imposes a
restriction different from those imposed by any other provision of this title
or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
   B.   Private Provisions: The provisions of this title are not intended to
abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction;
provided, that where the provisions of this title are more restrictive or
impose standards or regulations higher than such easement, covenant or other
private agreement or restriction, the requirements of this title shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or of higher
standards than the requirements of this title or the determination of the
planning commission in approving a subdivision or in enforcing this title, and
such private provisions are not inconsistent with this title or determination
thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to
this title and determinations made thereunder. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff.
2-10-1985)
12-1-16: SEPARABILITY:
If any section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of this title shall be
held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
holding shall not affect any other section, clause, paragraph, provision or
portion of this title. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-1-17: VIOLATION AND PENALTY:
   A.   Building Permit Issuance: No building permit shall be issued for any
new structure or change, improvement, or alteration of any existing structure
on any tract of land in a subdivision filed or recorded after the effective
date of this title, which does not comply with all the provisions of this
title.
   B.   Penalty Imposed: A violation of this title shall be deemed an offense
and shall be punishable by fine. Any person, firm or corporation which violates
or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this title shall be fined in
an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. Each
day a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense.

12-3-1: GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS:
   A.   The design of each new subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with
the principles established by the community plan for the city, and with the
minimum standards of these and other regulations.
   B.   The arrangement of lots, blocks and the street system should be
designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical
features. The system of sidewalks, roadways and the lot layout should be
designed to take advantage of the visual qualities of the area. (Ord. 1-10-85,
1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-2: STREETS:
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided
shall have frontage on, and access from, an existing street, unless such street
is:
         a.   An existing state or county roadway; or
         b.   A street shown upon a plat approved by the planning commission
and recorded in the county clerk's office. Such street or highway must be
suitably improved as required by the highway regulations and specifications, or
be secured by a performance bond required under this title, with the width and
right of way required by this chapter.
      2.   Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road
frontage, such road shall be suitably improved as provided herein.
      3.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall conform to all of the elements of the community plan and be
designed in accordance with the provisions of this title and other applicable
regulations.
      4.   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local roads
shall be curved wherever possible to provide topographic compatibility. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. A combination of steep grades
and curves shall be avoided.
      5.   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators (such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and
shopping centers), to population densities, and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
      6.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, the
location of rail facilities, the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic (including pedestrian).
      7.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided (unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions), unless, in the opinion of the planning commission, such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracks.
      8.   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned
or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of the proposed
future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and
submitted by the subdivider.
      9.   No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the planning commission and the city council.
      10.   Major streets in the subdivision shall be planned to conform with
the major street plan adopted by the city, and provision shall be made for the
extension of major and secondary thoroughfares. Except for courts, places or
cul-de-sacs, streets normally shall provide for a reasonable linkage with
streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, provide for
future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts, be a reasonable projection
of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts, or conform to a neighborhood plan
approved or adopted by the planning commission.
      11.   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major street, the planning commission may require service streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
through and local traffic.
      12.   Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
      13.   Railroad rights of way and limited access highways, where so
located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as
follows:
         a.   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least twenty five
feet (25') in depth, in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the
district, shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right of way or limited
access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be
designated as follows on the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The
placement of structures hereon is prohibited.".
         b.   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses,
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
         c.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least one hundred fifty feet (150') from the railroad right of
way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
      14.   Reserve strips controlling access to minor streets by parties or
persons other than public agencies shall be prohibited.
      15.   Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of this title, and provided that the planning commission finds it
will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half of the street
easement when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street is
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
platted within the tract which is being subdivided.
      16.   Whenever the major or minor street is located wholly within the
proposed subdivision, the total width of the right of way shall be dedicated.
Whenever the major or minor street is located adjacent to the outer edge of the
subdivision, one-half (1/2) of the right of way shall be dedicated, if it is
determined by the planning commission that it is equitable and feasible from an
engineering and design standpoint for the other half of the right of way to be
dedicated from adjacent property.
      17.   The finished elevation of proposed streets within the designated
floodplain shall be no more than two feet (2') below the level of the 100-year
flood.
      18.   The criteria established in the table below (Street Design
Standards) shall be followed in the layout and design of all major and minor
streets. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)

08, 5-13-2008)
   B.   Alignment:
      1.   The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
principal streets between adjacent properties, when such continuation is
necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection,
efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation is in accordance
with the community plan.
      2.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty
feet (150') shall be avoided.
      3.   A tangent of not less than one hundred feet (100') in length shall
be introduced between reverse curves on major streets and collector streets.
   C.   Cul-De-Sacs And Dead End Streets:
      1.   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall normally be five hundred
feet (500'), including a turnaround which shall be provided at the closed end,
with an inside curb radius of at least forty feet (40') and right of way radius
of not less than fifty feet (50').
      2.   In the case of temporarily dead ended streets which are incomplete
but designed to provide future connection with adjoining unsubdivided areas,
proper provisions shall be made for adequate storm drainage so that stormwater
does not collect at the ends of these streets. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead end street temporarily, the right of
way and the improvements shall be extended to the property line. The planning
commission may limit the length of temporary dead end streets in accordance
with the design standards of this title.
      3.   Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and
its continuation is not required by the planning commission for access to
adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary
than fifty feet (50'). However, the planning commission may require the
reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities,
pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at
the end of a permanent dead end street. For greater convenience to traffic and
more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead end streets shall, in
general, be limited in length, in accordance with the design standards of this
title.
   D.   Intersections:
      1.   Streets shall be laid out to intersect at right angles and may be
curved, if necessary, in order to make this possible. In no event shall a
street intersect any other street at any angle of less than seventy five
degrees (75°).
      2.   Street corners on local residential streets shall have a minimum
radius of twenty feet (20') at the curb line or its equivalent.
      3.   Street corners on commercial and industrial streets shall have a
minimum radius of twenty five feet (25') at the curb line or its equivalent.
      4.   Street intersections involving major streets shall have a minimum
street corner radius of thirty feet (30') at the curb line or its equivalent.
      5.   A twenty five foot (25') area of clear vision at street
intersections in subdivisions shall be provided. This area shall be kept clear
of all structures and vegetation exceeding a height of three feet (3') above
the established city street elevation. Where any street intersection will
involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner, that would
create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such
ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of
the public right of way, to the extent deemed necessary to provide adequate and
unobstructed vision.
      6.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent (2%) rate
at a distance of sixty feet (60'), measured from the nearest right of way line
of the intersecting street. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-3: ALLEYS:
   A.   Alleys Or Easements Required; Exception: Alleys or easements (as
directed by the planning commission) shall be provided in all subdivisions,
except that the planning commission may waive this requirement in commercial
and industrial districts, where other definite and assured provisions are made
for service access, such as off street loading, unloading and parking,
consistent with and adequate for, the uses proposed.
   B.   Alley Width:
      1.   Residential Areas: Alleys or easements for residential areas shall
not be less than twenty feet (20') in width.
      2.   Commercial And Industrial Areas: Alleys serving commercial and
industrial areas shall not be less than twenty feet (20') in width.
   C.   Intersections, Alignment: Alley intersections and sharp changes in
alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall permit safe
vehicular movement.
   D.   Dead End Alleys: Dead end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but
if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the
dead end, as determined by the planning commission. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985,
eff. 2-10-1985; amd. Ord. 24-09, 1-14-2025)
12-3-4: PEDESTRIANWAYS:
See chapter 4, "Subdivision Improvements", of this title. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-
1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-5: EASEMENTS:
   A.   Street And Alley:
      1.   Where alleys are not provided, easements not less than ten feet
(10') wide shall be provided along each rear lot line, and alongside lot lines
where necessary for use by public and private utilities. The planning
commission may require aerial easements and easements of greater width for the
extension of main storm and sanitary sewers and other utilities, where it is
deemed necessary.
      2.   Right of way widths in excess of the standards designated in this
title shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is
necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess
of three to one (3:1).
   B.   Utility:
      1.   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities
(private and municipal). Such easements shall be at least ten feet (10') wide.
Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the
applicable utility companies for the establishment of utility easements in
adjoining properties.
      2.   In large lot or "residential estates" subdivisions, or where
topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion
of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed easements at
least ten feet (10') in width shall be provided along side lot lines with
satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines. Easements shall be indicated
on the final plat.
   C.   Drainage:
      1.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage
right of way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width, and/or construction as will be adequate for the purpose. Wherever
possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel
with landscaped banks and adequate width, for maximum potential volume of flow.
      2.   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make the
inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights of way impractical,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen feet (15') in width for such
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines
and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the
final plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
      3.   When a proposed drainage system will carry waste across private land
outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the final plat.
      4.   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee simple title, or by
drainage or conservation easement, land on both sides of existing watercourses,
to a distance to be determined by the planning commission.
      5.   Low lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or overflow
during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall be
preserved and retained in their natural state as drainageways. Such land or
lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in determining the
number of lots to be utilized for average density procedure, nor for computing
the area requirements of any lot. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-6: LOTS:
   A.   Arrangement: Lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning
ordinance and health regulations, and in providing driveway access to buildings
on such lots from an approved street. Where possible, driveways shall be
designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on
major streets or collector streets.
   B.   Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of
the zoning ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area
for the zoning district, the planning commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance
with the zoning ordinance and this title.
   C.   Side Lot Lines: In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to
street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this
rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be
large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum front
yard setback from both streets.
   D.   Depth: The depth of residential lots, other than lots for townhouses,
should not be less than seventy-five feet (75').
   E.   Area: The area of residential lots, other than lots for townhouses,
shall not be less than five thousand (5,000) square feet.
   F.   Septic Tank Installation; Lot Size: In subdivisions where septic tanks
or other individual sewerage disposal devices are to be installed, the size of
all lots included in such subdivision shall be subject to the approval of the
state department of environmental quality (DEQ). The DEQ shall notify the
developer and the planning commission in writing of its findings.
   G.   Double Or Reverse Frontage: Double frontage and reverse frontage lots
shall be avoided, except where they are needed to provide for the separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation.
   H.   Commercial And Industrial Use: Lots shall not be required for
subdivisions for commercial and industrial use, but when provided should be of
appropriate size and arrangement to provide for adequate off street parking and
loading facilities based on the intended use. No individual parcel shall be
created for a particular commercial or industrial use that has an area, width
or depth that is less than is required for the permitted use under the
applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff.
2-10-1985; amd. 2013 Code; Ord. 24-09, 1-14-2025)
12-3-7: BLOCKS:
   A.   Dimension And Shape: The dimensions and shape of blocks shall consider
the following:
      1.   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated;
      2.   Zoning requirements (lot sizes and dimensions);
      3.   Convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street
traffic; and
      4.   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
   B.   Length: Blocks for residential use shall not be longer than one
thousand eight hundred feet (1,800'), measured along the centerline of the
block.
   C.   Pedestrianways Or Crosswalks: Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less
than four feet (4') wide or more than ten feet (10') in width, may be required
by the planning commission through the center of blocks more than eight hundred
feet (800') long, where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community
facilities.
   D.   Width: Blocks used for residential purposes should be of sufficient
width to allow for two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended
for business and industrial use should be of a width suitable for the intended
use, with due allowance for off street parking and loading facilities. (Ord. 1-
10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-8: BUILDING LINES:
   A.   Residential Subdivisions: Building lines shall be provided for all
residential subdivisions, in accordance with the setback requirements of the
zoning ordinance.
   B.   Side Yard: A side yard building line shall be provided not less than
five feet (5') back of a crosswalk right of way line on the side of a lot
abutting a midblock crosswalk or pedestrianway.
   C.   Oil Or Gas Well Restrictions:
      1.   Where there is found to be a producing oil or gas well which is in
or within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the boundaries of the proposed
subdivision, or an abandoned oil or gas well which is not adequately plugged
according to the standards established by state law and the Oklahoma
corporation commission (and so certified by said corporation commission) and
which is outside of the boundaries of a proposed subdivision but within one
hundred fifty feet (150') thereof, there shall be a building setback line so
placed on the plat so as to prevent the erection of any building within one
hundred fifty feet (150') of such wells.
      2.   Where there is found to be an abandoned oil or gas well which is
adequately plugged according to the standards established by state law and the
Oklahoma corporation commission, which well is within the boundaries of a
proposed subdivision, certificate or clearance from the Oklahoma corporation
commission shall be obtained for each such well before the final plat of the
subdivision is approved. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-9: PUBLIC AREAS:
   A.   Incorporation Into Plats: Except when an applicant utilizes planned
development provisions, whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a school,
recreation uses (in excess of the requirements of section 12-3-10 of this
chapter), or other public use as indicated in the community plan or any portion
thereof, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant into his
sketch plat. After proper determination of its necessity by the planning
commission and the appropriate local official or other agency involved in the
acquisition and use of each such site, and after a determination has been made
to acquire the site by the public agency, the site shall be suitably
incorporated by the applicant into the preliminary and final plats.
   B.   Recommendations For Acquisition: The planning commission shall refer
the sketch plat to the public body concerned with acquisition for its
consideration and report. The planning commission may propose alternate areas
for such acquisition and shall allow the public body or agency thirty (30) days
for reply. The agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map
showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired, and an estimate
of the time required to complete the acquisition.
   C.   Notify Property Owner: Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the
planning commission shall notify the property owner and designate on the
preliminary and final plats that area proposed to be acquired by the public
body.
   D.   Time Limit: The acquisition of land reserved by a public agency on the
final plat shall be initiated within twelve (12) months of notification, in
writing, from the owner that he intends to develop the land. Such letter of
intent shall be accompanied by a sketch plat of the proposed development and a

   A.   Requirements: Where, as indicated by the community plan, a proposed
subdivision contains, wholly or in part, a proposed public open space (parks,
recreation areas, etc.), the following requirements shall apply:
      1.   In subdivisions containing eighty (80) acres or more, the subdivider
shall make a dedication of suitable land for public purposes of not less than
two percent (2%) of the total land area of the subdivision.

commission shall require the dedication of one percent (1%) of the total land
area, or shall require the payment of a fee equal to the market value of one
percent (1%) of the total land area of the subdivision. Such fee is to be
deposited in a fund reserved and expended for park facilities and improvements
only.
      3.   In lieu of either of the above standards, the subdivider may elect
to retain two percent (2%) of the total land area, to be designated as park or
open spaces, etc., such land to be maintained by the subdivider or by agreement
of the purchasers of lots in the subdivision (formal agreement required).
      4.   In no case will the subdivider dedicate land for public parks and
open spaces unless the city agrees to develop and maintain such parks or open
spaces.
   B.   Preservation Of Existing Features: Existing features which would add
value to residential development or to the city as a whole, such as tree
masses, watercourses, landmarks, historic sites and similar irreplaceable
assets shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision, whenever possible.
No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of grade of the
land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. All
trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees,
where required, shall be welled and protected against change of grade. The
sketch plat shall show the number and location of existing trees and shall
further indicate all those marked for retention, as well as the location of all
proposed shade trees along the street side of each lot.
   C.   Tree Planting Approval: New trees provided in new subdivisions shall be
approved by the planning commission and shall be planted in accordance with all
city regulations. Only long lived trees, acceptable to the planning commission,
shall be planted, consistent with the community plan.
   D.   Easement For Shade Trees: The preliminary plat and final plat shall
include an easement authorizing the local government to plant shade trees
within five feet (5') of any required access or right of way. This provision
may be waived at the option of the planning commission. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-
1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-11: NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Layout: If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall be made according to such provisions as the planning
commission may require.
   B.   Compliance With Zoning, Other Regulations: A nonresidential subdivision
shall be subject to all of the requirements of the zoning ordinance, as well as
such additional standards as may be required by the planning commission.
   C.   Principles And Standards: In addition to the principles and standards
in this title, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
planning commission that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is
specifically adapted to the uses anticipated, and takes into account other uses
in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed:
      1.   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions
to the types of industrial development anticipated;
      2.   Street rights of way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon;
      3.   Special requirements may be imposed with respect to street, curb,
gutter and sidewalk design and construction;
      4.   Special requirements may be imposed with respect to the installation
of public utilities, including water, sewer and stormwater drainage;
      5.   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent areas from the
potential nuisance of a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary; and
      6.   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-3-12: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT:
Whenever a subdivision is developed as a planned development under the
appropriate provisions of the zoning ordinance, wherein adequate park or
recreation area is provided, through traffic is cared for adequately and the
majority of the minor streets are of the cul-de-sac or loop type, the planning
commission may vary the design requirements of this title, in order to allow
the subdivider more freedom in the arrangement of streets and lots, but at the
same time protect the convenience, health, safety, and welfare of the entire
community. In no case, however, shall the overall density, intensity of use or
land area coverage for the planned development exceed those minimums
established in the zoning ordinance for the district in which such uses would
normally be located. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)

12-4-12: WATER SYSTEM:
   A.   Water Lines And Fire Hydrants: The developer shall install water lines
and fire hydrants in accordance with the standards and specifications of this
title and other applicable regulations. In no case shall the use of flexible
PVC pipe or any rigid plastic with a wall thickness and strength of less than
ASA standard schedule 40 be allowed.
   B.   Water Supply District: Action shall be taken by the developer to extend
or create a water supply district for the purpose of providing a water supply
system capable of providing domestic water use and fire protection. This system
shall provide an adequate supply of potable water to every lot in the
subdivision.
   C.   Installation Of Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants shall be required for all
subdivisions except those approved for low density zoning districts in which
individual wells are to be used. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than
six hundred feet (600') apart and within five hundred feet (500') of any
structure. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for
fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves and all other supply
improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street shown on
the subdivision plat.
   D.   Public Water Main Accessible: Where a public water main is accessible,
the developer shall install adequate water facilities (including fire
hydrants), subject to the specifications of state or city requirements. All
water mains shall be at least six inches (6") in diameter.
   E.   Approval Of Water Main Extensions: Water main extensions shall be
approved by appropriate government agencies.
   F.   Preliminary Plat; Improvement Bond: To facilitate the above, the
location of all fire hydrants, all water supply improvements and the boundary
lines of proposed districts, indicating all improvements proposed to be served,
shall be shown on the preliminary plat, and the cost of installing same shall
be included in the improvement bond to be furnished by the developer.
   G.   Use Of Water Wells: In subdivisions approved by the planning commission
for low density zoning districts, if a public water system is not available,
individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in such a
manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot
in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the state health
department for its approval, and individual wells and central water systems
shall be approved by the state health department.
   H.   Arrangement For Future Water Service: If the planning commission
requires that a connection to a public water main be eventually provided as a
condition to approval of an individual well or central water system, the
applicant shall make arrangements, including the provision of necessary
easements for future water service at the time the plat receives final
approval. Improvement or cash bonds may be required to ensure compliance. (Ord.
1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
   I.   Locater Wires: Copper locater wires shall be placed at each meter and
valve along all water lines. (Ord. 11-01, 1-11-2011)
   J.   Depth Of Lines: Lines shall be buried a minimum depth of thirty inches
(30"). (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-4-13: SEWAGE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:
   A.   Connection To Public Sanitary Sewer: In accordance with the standards
and specifications of these and other applicable regulations, the subdivider
shall install sanitary sewers whenever a sanitary sewer is reasonably
accessible, as determined by this code or the planning commission. If a public
sanitary sewer is placed in a street or alley abutting any property, the owner
thereof shall be required to connect to said sewer for the purpose of waste,
and it shall be unlawful for any such owner or occupant to maintain upon any
such property an individual sewage disposal system, consistent with this code.
   B.   Private Disposal Systems; Requirements: Whenever a sanitary sewer is
not reasonably accessible, septic tanks or other unit disposal systems may be
used; provided, that such systems comply with the requirements of the Oklahoma
state department of health and are not located within twenty feet (20') of the
lot line of the lot on which the system is located. Where sanitary sewer
systems are not reasonably accessible and will not become available for a
period in excess of five (5) years, the applicant may install sewage systems as
follows:
      1.   Medium Density Residential Districts: Central sewerage system only;
no individual disposal systems will be permitted. Where plans exist for a
public sewer system to be built in a greater period than five (5) years, the
applicant shall install all sewer lines, laterals and mains to be in permanent
conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such public sewer main.
      2.   Low Density Residential Districts: Individual disposal systems or
central sewerage systems may be used; however, easements for future use shall
be included on the final plat.
   C.   Design, Approval: All sanitary sewer improvements shall be designed by
an engineer registered in the state of Oklahoma, and shall be approved by the
city council, the planning commission, the state health department and other
appropriate agencies. Sanitary sewer design shall be in accordance with the
design criteria for sanitary sewers in this chapter. In no case shall the use
of flexible PVC pipe or any rigid plastic pipe with a wall thickness and
strength of less than ASA standard schedule 40 be allowed. Locater wires shall
be placed at all main connections.
   D.   Compliance With Plan Or Report: When required or proposed improvements
correspond with recommended improvements contained in the city's community
plan, or other approved sanitary sewer report or document, said facility shall
be designed in accordance with said plan or report.
   E.   City Participation In Excess Cost: When an improvement required by the
community plan, or other approved sanitary sewer report or document, exceeds
the capacity needed to serve the proposed development, the city may participate
in the excess cost of such facility, in accordance with the city's adopted
utility extension policies.
   F.   Low And Medium Density Residential Districts; Alternative Systems: In
low and medium density residential districts, where a public sanitary sewerage
system is reasonably accessible, and will become available within a reasonable
time (not to exceed 5 years), the developer may choose one of the following
alternatives:
      1.   Central Sewerage System: (Maintenance cost to be assessed against
each property benefited.) Where plans for future public sanitary sewerage
systems exist, the developer shall install the sewer lines, laterals and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains; or
      2.   Individual Disposal Systems: The developer shall install sanitary
sewer lines, laterals and mains from the street curb to a point in the
subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public sewer main shall
be made, in addition to allowing the use of individual systems on each site. As
a condition of building permit approval on each housing unit in such an area,
sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the street line, and a connection
shall be available in the home to connect from the individual disposal system
to the sewer system when the public sewers become available. Such sewer systems
shall be capped until ready for use and shall conform to all plans for
installation of the public sewer system, where such exist, and shall be ready
for connection to such public sewer main.
   G.   High Density Residential And Nonresidential Districts: Sewage
collection and disposal systems in high density residential and nonresidential
districts shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems. Sewers shall be
installed to serve each lot and to grades and sizes required by local officials
and approving agencies. No individual disposal system or treatment plants
(private or group disposal systems) shall be permitted. Sanitary sewerage
facilities (including the installation of laterals in the right of way) shall
be subject to the specifications, rules, regulations and guidelines of the city
and the state health department.
   H.   Individual Disposal Systems; Minimum Lot Areas: If public sewer
facilities are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed,
minimum lot areas shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance,
and percolation tests and test holes shall be made as directed by the city
building official and the results submitted to the health department. The
individual disposal system, including the size of the septic tanks and size of
the tile fields or other secondary treatment devices, shall also be approved by
the city building official, and be in accordance with the state statutes. (Ord.
1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-4-14: DESIGN CRITERIA FOR SANITARY SEWERS:
   A.   Deviations In Design Criteria: These design criteria are not intended
to cover extraordinary situations. Deviations will be allowed and may be
required in those instances where considered justified by the city council.
   B.   Design Factors: Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for the
ultimate tributary population. Due consideration should be given to current
regulations and reports, where applicable. Sewer capacities should be adequate
to handle the anticipated maximum hourly quantity of sewerage and industrial
waste, together with an adequate allowance for infiltration and other
extraneous flow.
   C.   Maximum Size: The diameter of sewers proposed shall not exceed the
diameter of the existing or proposed outlet, whichever is applicable, unless
otherwise approved by the planning commission.
   D.   Minimum Size: No public sewer shall be less than eight inches (8") in
diameter, except that the use of a six inch (6") diameter sewer may be
permitted in situations where it cannot be extended and no more than four
hundred feet (400') will be installed in any one place.
   E.   Velocity Of Flow:
      1.   All sewers shall be designed and constructed with hydraulic slopes
sufficient to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two
feet (2') per second (based on Kutter's or Manning's formula using an "n" value
of 0.013). Use of other practical "n" values will be approved for the longer
pipe sections, if deemed justifiable on the basis of research or field data
presented. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided,
especially where the depth of flow may be small, and are desirable minima in
all parts of the system:
   MINIMUM SLOPES FOR SEWER SIZES
Sewer Size (Inches) Minimum Slope
                    In Feet Per 100 Feet
Sewer Size (Inches) Minimum Slope
                    In Feet Per 100 Feet
8                   0.40
10                  0.29
12                  0.22
14                  0.17
15                  0.15
16                  0.14
18                  0.12
21                  0.10
24                  0.08
 
      2.   Under special conditions, if full and justifiable reasons are given,
slopes slightly less than those required for the two foot (2') per second
velocity when full may be permitted. Such decreased slopes will only be
considered where the depth of flow will be 0.3 of the diameter or greater for
design average flow. Whenever such decreased slopes are selected, the engineer
must furnish with his report his computations of the depths of flow in such
pipes at minimum, average and peak rates of flow. It is recognized that such
flatter grades may cause additional sewer maintenance expense and odor
nuisance. The selection of the size of pipe shall be determined on the basis of
the most desirable flow characteristic obtainable.
   F.   Alignment: All sewers shall be laid with straight alignment between
manholes, unless otherwise directed or approved by the planning commission or
the city council.
   G.   Manhole Location: Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line;
at all changes in grade, size or alignment; at all intersections; and at
distances not greater than four hundred feet (400') for sewers fifteen inches
(15") and smaller and five hundred feet (500') for eighteen inches (18") in
diameter and larger.
   H.   Manholes: The difference in elevation between an incoming sewer and the
manhole invert shall not exceed twelve inches (12") except where required to
match crowns. The use of drop manholes will require approval by the local
government engineer. The minimum inside diameter of the manholes shall conform
to those specified by the city council or the planning commission. Inside drop
manholes will require special considerations; however, in no case shall the
minimum clear distance be less than that indicated above. When a smaller sewer
joins a larger one, the crown of the smaller sewer shall not be lower than that
of the larger one. The minimum drop through manholes shall be 0.2 foot.
   I.   Sewerage Locations: Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or
alley rights of way, unless topography dictates otherwise. When located in
easements on private property, access shall be to all manholes. A manhole shall
be provided at each street or alley crossing. End lines shall be extended to
provide access from street or alley right of way where possible. Imposed
loading shall be considered in all locations. Not less than six feet (6') of
cover shall be provided over top of pipe in street and alley rights of way or
three feet (3') in all other areas.
   J.   Water Supply Interconnections: There shall be no physical connection
between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer, which will
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells and other water supply
sources and structures.
   K.   Relation Of Sewers To Water Mains: A minimum horizontal distance of ten
feet (10') shall be maintained between parallel water and sewer lines. At
points where sewers cross water mains, the sewer shall be constructed of cast
iron pipe or encased in concrete for a distance of ten feet (10') in each
direction from the crossing, measured perpendicular to the water line. This
will not be required when the water main is at least two feet (2') above the
sewer. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
12-4-15: STORM DRAINAGE AND FLOOD HAZARD AREAS:
   A.   Compliance With Design And Improvement Requirements: All subdivisions
of land shall comply with the design and improvement requirements herein
established for the protection of flood hazard areas and the prevention of
erosion.
   B.   Drainage Classifications: For the purpose of this title, drainage shall
be classified as follows:
      1.   Surface drainage is runoff of such a limited quantity and/or slow
rate that it does not cause erosion of a defined channel;
      2.   A minor tributary is any drainage channel having a drainage basin of
six hundred forty (640) acres (1 square mile) or less in area;
      3.   A major tributary is any channel having a drainage basin of not less
than one square mile or greater than twenty five (25) square miles; and
      4.   A river is any channel having a drainage basin of greater than
twenty five (25) square miles.
   C.   Allocation Of Responsibility: Responsibility for drainage shall be
allocated as follows, unless otherwise specifically designated:
      1.   The developer of a subdivision is responsible for the following:
         a.   All surface drainage on the subdivision;
         b.   All increase in surface drainage outside the subdivision which
results from the development of the subdivision;
         c.   The improvement of all minor tributaries lying within the
subdivision;
         d.   Any significant increase in the rate or quantity of runoff in any
minor or major tributary, or river, which results from the development of the
subdivision; and
         e.   Provision for the maintenance of all floodway and floodway fringe
areas of major tributaries and rivers which have not been dedicated to the
public.
      2.   The city and other levels of governments will be responsible for the
following:
         a.   The improvement of floodways of major tributaries;
         b.   The improvement of river floodways; and
         c.   The maintenance of floodway and floodway fringe areas dedicated
to the public.
   D.   Designation On Maps And Plats: Flood hazard areas are designated on the
official zoning district map of the city. The boundaries of all floodway and
floodway fringe areas shall be designated on the preliminary and final plats
and shall be clearly marked.
   E.   Preparation Of Drainage Assessment: For all areas not otherwise
designated in a floodway or floodway fringe area, the developer shall be
responsible for having an engineer (registered in Oklahoma) prepare a drainage
assessment of all of the area of the proposed subdivision, and all areas
affected by runoff resulting from development of the proposed subdivision in
accordance with the following provisions:
      1.   The 100-year maximum flood shall be used as the basis for the sizing
of all drainage channels, bridges and other structures, unless otherwise
specified herein;
      2.   The calculation of all runoff shall be based on saturated
urbanization of the drainage basin for minor tributaries and surface drainage,
as reflected in the community plan, and shall be based on the maximum degree of
urbanization, as reflected in the community plan, for the drainage basin of a
major tributary or river; and
      3.   The calculation of stream flow and runoff characteristics of the
subdivision shall be carried out in consultation with the planning commission
and the city council, and the methodology and formulas used shall result in
quantities which would be not less than those derived from the application of
the following formulas and values:
         a.   Runoff from all drainage areas shall be not less than that
determined by the rational formula:
      Q = AIR
      Q = Cubic feet per second.
      A = Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for areas
less than 640 acres, and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger areas.
      I = Percent of imperviousness of the area. This may vary between 40
percent and 95 percent, but no value of less than 50 percent may be used for
saturated urban development.
      R = Rate of rainfall over entire drainage area in inches per hour, based
on time of concentration and latest government records for the area.
         b.   The size of closed storm sewers, open channels, culverts and
bridges shall not be less than that determined by using the Manning formula:
   Q = 1,486r 2/3 s1/2 A
         n
      Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second.
      A = Cross sectional area of water in conduit in square feet.
      r = Hydraulic radius of water in conduit.
      s = Mean slope of hydraulic gradient, in feet of vertical rise per foot
of horizontal distance.
      n = Roughness coefficient, based on condition and type of material of
conduit lining, but not less than 0.013.
   F.   Flowage Easements: All floodways located within the subdivision shall
be designated by the developer as "flowage easements" and shall be maintained
as permanent open space for private recreation or agriculture for which no
buildings or structures are required, or dedicated to the public for drainage,
recreation and utility use.
   G.   Uses Restricted: All floodway fringe areas shall be planned for uses
which are permitted in the appropriate district of the zoning ordinance, and in
no case shall the proposed use or construction cause a displacement of
floodwater in the floodway fringe that will increase flooding in other areas of
the floodway or floodway fringe.
   H.   Reduction Of Adverse Effects: When it is determined by the planning
commission that the development of the subdivision will significantly increase
runoff in the flood hazard area or will otherwise adversely affect stormwater
runoff, the planning commission may require any or all of the following to the
extent needed to reduce the adverse effects of the development:
      1.   The existing floodway lying within or immediately adjacent to the
subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the
channel shall be straightened, widened and improved to the extent required to
prevent overflow beyond the limits of the floodway;
      2.   Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building sites
and streets to an elevation where all lots, building areas and streets will not
be subject to overflow, and in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff
of all rainfall; however, such improvements shall be carried out in a manner
that will preserve and protect large trees and attractive physical features of
the area;
      3.   Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, backsloping,
cribbing and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to control
erosion for all the anticipated conditions of flow for the segment of channel
involved;
      4.   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement, unless
it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer, or unless a paved street surface is
provided on both sides of a paved channel to give access to abutting
properties; or
      5.   Culverts, bridges and other drainage structures shall be constructed
in accordance with the specifications of the city at all locations where
drainage channels intersect with continuous streets or alleys.
   I.   Minor Tributary And Surface Drainage Channels: All minor tributary and
surface drainage channels located within the subdivision shall be improved in
accordance with the standards set forth in subsections G through O of this
section, and the diagram headed "Improved Drainage Channel, Width For 100-Year
Frequency Rain, 5 - 25 Year Frequency Rain", or other equivalent standards, as
determined by the city engineer. The diagram headed "Improved Drainage Channel,
100-Year Frequency Rain, 6'-6" Min." shall be used only for channels of minor
tributaries which drain less than eighty (80) acres, and which are designed as
an integral part of the landscape of the area, so that maintenance of sodded
slopes will be the responsibility of the property owners abutting the channel.
All channels shall be designed to carry a 100-year maximum flood, shall be
designed for self-cleaning and care or maintenance, shall have sufficient hard
surface along the flow line to prevent ponding of water, and shall have design
characteristics of alignment, materials of construction and cross sectioned
elements that will be hydraulically efficient and visually harmonious with the
adjacent landscape.
   J.   Enclosed Storm Sewers: Enclosed storm sewers may be required by the
city council where special or unusual conditions make open channels hazardous
or otherwise unfeasible.
   K.   Site Grading: Site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that
surface water from each lot shall flow directly to a storm sewer, improved
channel or paved street without crossing more than two (2) adjacent lots.
   L.   Surface Water Diverted To Storm Drains: Surface water collected on
streets shall be diverted to storm drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent
overflow of six inch (6") high curbs during a 50-year frequency rain for the
area and grades involved; provided, however, that in no case shall the drainage
area served by one street exceed twenty (20) acres, regardless of the amount of
flow.
   M.   Drainage Easements: Drainage easements of satisfactory width to provide
working room for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all storm
sewers. In no case shall the total easement be less than twenty feet (20').
   N.   Construction Of Closed Storm Sewers: Closed storm sewers shall be
constructed of precast or prefabricated pipe or built in place of closed box
design to conform with municipal construction specifications to serve a 100-
year frequency rain for the drainage area involved.
   O.   Bridges Or Culverts: Bridges or culverts shall be provided where
watercourses cross continuous streets or alleys, shall be sized to accommodate
a 100-year frequency rain (based on the drainage area involved), and shall be
designed in conformance with municipal construction specifications.

   P.   Open, Paved Storm Drainage Channels; Fences: Open, paved storm drainage
channels shall be constructed in accordance with municipal construction
specifications. Side slopes above the paved section shall be shaped and sodded
on a slope of four horizontal to one vertical (4:1), or flatter. Fences shall
be outside of the 100-year frequency flooding line, shall not be erected below
the shoulder of the sodded section and in no case shall fences be closer than
six feet (6') (measured horizontally) to the edge of the paved section. Hand
laid riprap may be substituted for sodded shoulders where desired.
   Q.   City Right To Require Certain Improvements: The city reserves the right
to require: 1) improvements; 2) the provision of drainage easements; and 3) the
provision of agreements beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, to facilitate
flow of water through the addition, to avoid probability of lawsuits, based on
damage from changed runoff in the subdivision and to provide continuous
improvements of the overall storm drainage system. The following kinds of
improvements may be required:
      1.   Enlargement or replacement of undersized drainage structures to
provide free flow;
      2.   Removal of obstructions;
      3.   Straightening of channel;
      4.   Widening or deepening of the channel;
      5.   Construction of erosion control structures;
      6.   Backsloping, sodding and/or riprapping of bank; or
      7.   Construction of closed or open, paved storm sewers for the purposes
of closing gaps or continuation of the overall storm sewer system.
   R.   Property Owner Agreements: Property owner agreements, where required,
shall be designed to protect the city from probable lawsuits for damage caused
by changed runoff conditions.
   S.   Retention Reservoirs: When subdivision development will result in
increased runoff beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, which cannot be
accommodated through channel improvements without causing downstream flooding,
the planning commission may require the construction of one or more retention
reservoirs on the subdivision which will temporarily impound and discharge
water from the subdivision site at the rate and volume equivalent to the
discharge from the undeveloped subdivision site. The design shall be for a 100-
year frequency flood. Plans shall be approved by the city's engineer. The
construction and maintenance of retention reservoirs shall be the
responsibility of the developer. (Ord. 1-10-85, 1-10-1985, eff. 2-10-1985)
