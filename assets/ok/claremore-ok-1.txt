all officers, employee, members of boards and committees, and trustees of
public trust with the city as a beneficiary; and that such individuals shall
not use their public positions for personal gain nor should they act in such a
way as to give an appearance of any impropriety.

evidence of occupancy or any bill, statement or charge made for such occupancy

personally liable for the tax collected or required to be collected under this
title.
      (4)   The operator shall have the same right in respect to collecting the

if the tax were a part of the rent for the occupancy payable at the same time
such tax shall become due and owing, including all rights of eviction,
dispossession, repossession and enforcement of any innkeeper’s lien that he or

however, that the city shall be joined as a party in any action or proceeding
brought by the operator to collect or enforce collection of the tax.

constitute a prior, superior and paramount claim as against the claim of
unsecured creditors and may be collected by suit as any other debt.

collect a tax as imposed by this chapter, then, in addition to all other
rights, obligations and remedies provided, such tax shall be payable by the
occupant directly to the city, and it shall be the duty of the occupant to file
a return thereof with the Tax Collector and to pay the tax imposed thereon to
the Tax Collector, within 15 days after such tax was due.

herein imposed at such times as returns are required to be filed and payment
over made by the operator.

or other term basis, the rent so paid, charged, billed or falling due shall be
subject to the tax herein imposed to the extent that it covers any portion of
the period after May 1, 2001, and such payment, bill, charge or rent due shall
be apportioned on the basis of the ratio of the number of days falling within
such portion to the total number of days covered thereby.
      (2)   Where any tax has been paid hereunder upon any rent which has been
ascertained to be worthless, the Tax Collector may, by regulation, provide for
credit or refund of the amount of such tax upon application as provided herein.
   (H)   To properly administer this subchapter and to prevent evasion of the
tax it imposes, it shall be presumed that all rentals are subject to the tax
until facts to the contrary are established; and the burden of providing that a
rent for occupancy is not taxable hereunder shall be upon the operator or the
occupant.
   (I)   No operator shall advertise or hold out to the public in any manner,
directly or indirectly, that the tax imposed by this subchapter is not
considered as an element in the rent charged to the occupant.

         (a)   The utility shall measure the net electricity produced or
consumed by the customer during each billing period, in accordance with normal
metering practices.
         (b)   If the energy supplied by the utility exceeds the energy
generated by the customer during
the billing period, then the customer shall be billed for the net energy
supplied by the utility together with the appropriate customer charge and
applicable fees, if any, paid by other customers of the utility in the same
rate class.
         (c)   If the energy generated by the customer during the billing
period exceeds the energy supplied by the utility, then the customer shall:
            1.   Be billed for the appropriate customer service charge and
applicable fees, if any, paid by other customers of the utility in the same
rate class.
            2.   Not have any excess energy generated during each billing
period be purchased by the utility.

action is necessary to protect persons, or the utility's facilities, or the
property of others from damage or interference caused by the customer's
electric generating facilities, or a lack of properly operating protective
devices or inability to inspect the same.
         (b)   The utility inspection or other action shall not constitute
approval by the utility. The customer remains solely responsible for the safe
and adequate operation of its facilities.
      (9)   Indemnity.
         (a)   Customer shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the
utility, its directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any
and all losses, liability, damages, claims, costs, charges, demands, or
expenses (including any direct, indirect or consequential loss, liability,
damage, claim, cost, charge, demand, or expense, and reasonable attorneys'
fees) for injury or death to persons and damage to property, arising, directly
or indirectly, out of or in connection with (a) engineering, design,
construction, maintenance, repair, operation, supervision, inspection, testing,
protection or ownership of customer's facilities; provided, however, customer's
duty to indemnify utility shall not extend to any loss, liability, damage,
claim, cost, charge, demand, or expense resulting from interruptions in
electrical service to utility's electric utility customers other than customer.
Utility shall not be indemnified hereunder for its loss, liability, damage,

   (B)   All solid waste must be placed inside a poly-cart, commercial
container, or roll-off container. Bulk refuse or oversized solid waste requires
contacting the provider of such services to arrange for a bulk pick up for an
additional charge.
   (C)   Improper use of containers:
      (1)   No one may place any hazardous, dangerous, or otherwise prohibited
item or substance in a container for collection by the city. The city and any
third-party provider reserves the right to refuse to collect solid waste from
any container containing any such items or substances. Prohibited items

propane, or butane;
         (b)   Dangerous or hazardous chemicals and solvents, paint, or
pesticides;
         (c)   Tires or batteries; and
         (d)   Any object(s) that are deemed by the Sanitation Superintendent
or third-party provider to be hazardous to the operation of the sanitation
truck.
      (2)   Violations of division (C)(1) of this section shall be an offense
punishable as provided in §
10.99.
      (3)   No one may place more solid waste in a container than the container
is designed to hold. The city or third-party provider reserves the right to
refuse to collect solid waste from an overweight or overloaded container. A
container shall be considered overloaded if the lid of any container will not
completely close and/or if the maximum poly-cart weight limit of 200 pounds is
exceeded.

   (D)   Except in quantities, or concentrations, or with provisions as
stipulated herein, it shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, or
individual to discharge waters or wastes to the public sanitary sewers
containing:
      (1)   Free or emulsified oil and grease exceeding on analysis an average
of 100 mg/l (834 pounds per million gallons) of either or both or combinations
of free or emulsified oil and grease, if, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
it appears probable that such wastes:
         (a)   Can deposit grease or oil in the sanitary sewer lines in such a
manner as to clog the sanitary sewers;
         (b)   Can overload the discharge’s skimming and grease handling
equipment;
         (c)   Are not amenable to biological oxidation and will therefore pass
to the receiving waters without being affected by normal wastewater treatment
processes; or
         (d)   Can have deleterious effects on the treatment process due to the
excessive quantities.
      (2)   Acids or alkalies which attack or corrode sanitary sewers or
wastewater disposal structures or have a pH value lower than 5.0 or higher than
12.5;
      (3)   Salts of the heavy metals, in solution or suspension, in
concentrations, toxic to biological wastewater treatment processes, or
adversely affect sludge digestion or any other biochemical, biological, or
other wastewater treatment process, or to the biota of the receiving steam to
which the effluent of wastewater treatment facility discharges, or exceeding
the following from the Technically Based Local Limits (TBLL) Study approved by
ODEQ June 2014. The analytical results to be expressed in terms of the elements
indicated:
   Toxic Substance      mg/l
   Cadmium         0.54
   Chromium         2.77
   Copper            3.38
   Lead            0.69
   Mercury         0.26
   Nickel            3.98
   Zinc            2.61
or other elements which will damage collection facilities or are detrimental to
treatment processes or are detrimental to the biota of the receiving stream to
which the effluent of the wastewater treatment facility discharges. When the
volume of a single toxic industrial waste discharge, or the combined toxic
industrial waste discharge of a group of industries within a single
contributory area, is so large as to raise a question of the ultimate
concentration of toxic substances entering a treatment plant or a receiving
stream, the Superintendent shall impose separate or special concentration
limits upon the discharge to insure:
         (a)   That the concentration in wastewater of any toxic substances
shall not exceed those concentrations in the influent of any wastewater
treatment plant toxic to biological wastewater treatment processes, or
adversely affect sludge digestion, or sludge quality, or any biochemical,
biological or other wastewater treatment process; and
         (b)   That in no instance will be binned concentrations of any toxic
substances in the effluent of any wastewater treatment plant exceed the
discharge stream limitations as published by the state regulatory agency;
      (4)   Cyanides or cyanogen compounds capable of liberating hydrocyanic
gas on acidification in excess of two mg/l as CN in the wastes from any outlet
into the public sanitary sewers;
      (5)   Radioactive materials exceeding the existing standards of the State
Department of Health, or unless they comply with the Atomic Energy Commission
of 1954 (68 O.D. 919 as amended and Part 20, Subpart D-Waste Disposal, Section
20.303, of the regulations issued by the Atomic Energy Commission, or
amendments thereto);
      (6)   Any wastewater containing phenols or other waste producing
substances in such concentrations as to produce odor or taste in the effluent
as to affect the taste and odor of the receiving waters;
      (7)   Materials which exert or cause:
         (a)   Unusual concentrations of solids or composition, as for example
in total solids of inert nature (such as Fuller's Earth) or in total dissolved
solids (such as sodium chloride, calcium chloride, or sodium sulfate);
         (b)   Excessive discoloration;
         (c)   Unusual biochemical oxygen demand or an immediate oxygen demand;
         (d)   High hydrogen sulfide content; or
         (e)   Unusual flow and concentration;
      (8)   Toxic substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction
by the wastewater treatment process employed, or are amenable to treatment only
to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant cannot meet the requirements
of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters
without pretreating to a concentration acceptable to the city. When wastewater
containing any of the aforementioned materials is discharged into the sanitary
sewer and such wastes are not properly pretreated or otherwise corrected, the
Superintendent may:
         (a)   Reject the wastes and terminate the service to the sanitary
sewer;
         (b)   Require control of the quantities and rates of discharge of such
wastes with flow regulating devices; or
         (c)   Require payment of surcharges for excessive cost of treatment

than 25% of the content of the interceptor. If repairs are required, they shall
be performed within seven days.
   (B)   When required by the Superintendent, grease interceptors shall be
pumped and cleaned within 48 hours. When in the opinion of the Superintendent
the environment is threatened, the Superintendent may require a facility to
immediately cease operations until the facility’s grease interceptor is cleaned
and pumped.
   (C)   Grease interceptors shall have monitoring locations adequate for
obtaining representative effluent samples. Unless otherwise stated in an
industrial wastewater discharge permit, the local limits set forth in §§
52.027,
52.028 and
52.067 shall apply at these monitoring locations.
   (D)   Users shall document all cleaning and maintenance activities performed
on their grease interceptors. Copies of grease hauling and handling manifests
shall be maintained on site. These records shall be maintained for a minimum of

accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Waste-water,” published by the American Public Health Association,
and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable
samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic
grab samples.

N, Parts 405-471 are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference and
are enforceable by the city as fully as if set out at length herein.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
   (B)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Superintendent
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
   (C)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in
40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.
   (D)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.067 LOCAL LIMITS.
   (A)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in
excess of the following instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits:
      (1)   0.34 mg/l arsenic.
      (2)   0.54 mg/l cadmium.
      (3)   2.77 mg/l chromium.
      (4)   3.38 mg/l copper.

      (8)   3.98 mg/l nickel.
      (9)   0.43 mg/l silver.
      (10)   2.61 mg/l zinc.
      (11)   1.71 mg/l selenium.
      (12)   2.28 mg/l molybdenum.
   (B)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal
unless indicated otherwise. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations in
addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
   (C)   No person shall discharge wastewater containing concentrations of
molybdenum that in combination with other contributors shall exceed the
calculated maximum allowable mass headworks loading of that pollutant for the
Claremore Wastewater Treatment Plant. The city in issuing wastewater discharge
permits shall allocate a concentration limit for molybdenum to each significant

collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum
of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Superintendent
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by this section, the

Part 7. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 52.155 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation or notice
of noncompliance. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user
to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. A notice of violation may incorporate compliance orders and/or cease
and desist orders as described in §§
52.158 and
52.159 of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of
the Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.156 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
52.158 and
52.159 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.157 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.158 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.159 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.160 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
52.161 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§
52.157 or
52.161 of this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
52.065 through
52.069 of this chapter.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
52.157 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.

§ 52.200 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section, are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.201 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
52.065(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §§
52.065(B)(3) through (7) and
52.065(B)(9) through (17) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 93-5, passed 2-15-93)
§ 52.202 BY-PASS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section:
      (1)    BY-PASS means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)    SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a by-pass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any by-pass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These by-passes are
not subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a by-pass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of
the by-pass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated by-pass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the by-pass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the by-
pass. The written submission shall contain a description of the by-pass and its
cause; the duration of the by-pass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the by-pass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the by-pass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   (1)   By-pass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a by-pass, unless:
         (a)   By-pass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the by-pass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a by-pass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated by-pass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in subdivision (1) of this division.

lines and water lines. Each and all of the regulations, provisions, conditions
and terms of the “Sanitary Sewer and Water Line Construction and Installation
Policy” are hereby referred to, adopted and made a part hereof, as if fully set
out in this code.
(`83 Code, § 17-101) (Ord. 874, passed 3-15-82)
§ 53.10 DEVELOPMENT, EXTENSION OF WATER AND SEWER SERVICES TO NON- RESIDENTIAL
PROPERTY.
   (A)   The policy shall apply to non-residential property within the
corporate limits of the city, and to non-residential property contiguous to the
corporate limits of the city, provided that the owner of the non-residential
property shall agree to the annexation of the property into the city limits.
   (B)   For any non-residential sanitary sewer or water service in which the
city shall participate under the provisions of this section, the owner of the
non-residential property (hereinafter referred to as “owner”) shall furnish the
City Engineer and facilities manager a copy of the plans and specifications for
the sewer or water improvements and an itemized estimate of the cost for the
sewer or water pipe, all of which shall be prepared by a registered
professional engineer.
   (C)   The owner shall secure, at its expense, good and sufficient easements
and rights-of-way at least 25 feet in width for the purpose of installing the
sewer or water lines in question. The easements and rights-of-way shall also
permit the installation of all other city utilities over, under, through and
across the property to be burdened by the easements and rights-of-way. The
easements and rights-of-way shall prohibit the construction of permanent
structures and encroachments in the easement. The easements and rights-of-way
shall be to and for the benefit of the city and they shall be in a form
acceptable to the city. The easements and rights-of-way shall begin at the
point where the services then exist and shall extend to the owner's property
boundary, and across the owner's property at reasonable places if so desired by
the city.
   (D)   The city shall participate in the construction of the sanitary sewer
or water lines beyond the boundaries of the owner's property (off-site) on the
following basis:
      (1)   The owner, at its expense, shall pay for the construction of the
water or sanitary sewer lines for the first 250 linear feet, commencing at the
point where the water or sanitary sewer lines then exist;
      (2)   The city, at its expense, shall install the next 500 linear feet of
sanitary sewer or water lines, provided that the pipe and materials necessary
for the installation shall be furnished by the owner at its expense, and
further provided, that if it becomes necessary to remove rock in order to
install the lines, the owner, at its expense, shall be responsible for the
removal of the rock; and
      (3)   The construction of any additional off-site or water lines shall be
at the sole expense of the owner.
   (E)   Should the city request the owner to install sanitary sewer or water
lines greater in size than those lines which a registered professional engineer
has determined are adequate to service the owner's property, then the owner
shall install the larger lines (excess capacity lines) and the city shall
contribute to the difference between the cost of the pipe for the lines needed
by the owner and the cost of the pipe for the excess capacity lines. The city's
participation shall be as follows: The city shall determine what its pipeline
installation cost per linear foot is and it shall install off-site excess
capacity lines for more than the 500 feet provided for hereinabove, provided
that once the city's cost of installing additional excess capacity lines has
equalled the difference in pipe cost, the city shall cease to install
additional excess capacity lines. The owner shall continue to be liable for the
removal of any rock. In determining the need for excess capacity lines, the
city shall follow the guidelines of the City of Claremore-Rogers County
Metropolitan Area Comprehensive Plan or it shall base its decision upon
anticipated future development in the area. The cost of the pipe for the excess
capacity lines shall be based upon a supplier's itemized statements and
invoices showing the costs.
   (F)   The city's participation in the installation of the lines shall be
done at the convenience of the city and upon the availability of the equipment
necessary to perform the installation.
   (G)   The owner, at its expense, shall construct the water distribution
system, fire hydrant system, the sanitary sewer system, and the storm, water
run-off facilities (including detention or retention basins if required) within
the owner's property boundary lines (on-site).
   (H)   If the sanitary sewer system improvements require the construction of
a sanitary sewer lift station, the lift station shall be constructed at the
owner's expense. After the lift station has been in operation for 12 months,
the owner may request the city to accept maintenance of the lift station. Prior
to the acceptance of the lift station, the city shall reinspect the lift
station to satisfy itself that the lift station still meets the city's
standards and regulations regarding the construction, installation and
operation thereof. The city shall become responsible for maintenance of the
lift station from the time it reinspects the lift station and it accepts
responsibility for maintenance of the lift station in writing, provided that as
express conditions of its acceptance, the lift station must be in compliance
with city standards and regulations and the owner must furnish the city a good
and sufficient bond in a sum equal to the cost of construction of the lift
station, with adequate surety, on behalf of the city, to protect the city
against defective workmanship and materials for a period of one year after the
city's acceptance of the lift station. Further, prior to acceptance of the lift
station, the owner shall have furnished to the city all operational manuals,
pump curve charts, impeller size, electrical control panel configuration and
any other information regarding the operation of the sanitary sewer lift
station.
   (I)   All sanitary sewer or water lines and appurtenances thereto, including
but not limited to lift stations, water taps and sewer taps, shall be
constructed and installed in strict compliance with city specifications and
other applicable municipal, state and federal laws and regulations.

activity NPDES and/or OPDES Stormwater Discharge Permit shall comply with all
provisions of such permit(s). Proof of compliance with said permit(s) may be
required in a form acceptable to the Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater
Inspector prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. All construction
activities including but not limited to the development, excavation, clearing,
grading, regrading, paving, land filling, berming and diking of land shall be
conducted in such a manner as to minimize erosion and prevent the discharge of
pollutants, including but not limited to rock, sand, soil, discarded building
materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary waste into
the city’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4). Persons conducting the
construction shall implement and maintain adequate structural and/or
nonstructural BMPs for controlling erosion and preventing the discharge of
pollutants to the MS4. The discharge shall not result in a violation of the
city’s OPDES Municipal Stormwater Discharge
Permit. The discharge, based upon the determination of the Stormwater Manager
and/or Stormwater Inspector, shall not cause contamination of surface water,
stormwater or groundwater within the city. The discharge, based upon the
determination of the Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector, does not
transport sediment into the city’s MS4. All construction site stormwater runoff
control BMPs and post-construction stormwater runoff BMPs shall comply with the
current ODEQ OKR10 construction permit and the City of Claremore Engineering
Design Criteria and Standard Specifications.
      (2)   Responsible person. The person with overall responsibility of the
construction, such as the general contractor, shall be jointly responsible with
the person at whose direction the construction is being conducted for
compliance with division (A)(1) of this section.

make available to the Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector, for
inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained
under this section or order issued hereunder. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years after expiration of the
applicable permit. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration
of any litigation concerning compliance with this section, or where the person
or persons responsible have been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector.
   (B)   Construction. All construction activities, including the development,
excavation, grading, regrading, paving, landfilling, berming, and diking of
land shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize erosion and prevent the
discharge of pollutants, including but not limited to rock, sand, and soil into
the city’s MS4. Persons conducting the construction shall implement and
maintain adequate structural and/or nonstructural BMPs for controlling the
discharge of pollutants. In the case of ten acres or more draining to one
discharge point, a sediment basin or adequate alternate measures shall be
implemented. The adequacy of any BMP shall be based upon the fulfillment of the
following requirements:
      (1)   The discharge shall not result in a violation of the city’s OPDES
Municipal Storm Water Discharge Permit;
      (2)   The discharge, based upon the determination of the Director, shall
not cause contamination of surface water, stormwater or groundwater within the
city; and
      (3)   The discharge, based upon the determination of the Director, does
not transport sediment into the city’s MS4.
   (C)   Erosion control.  
      (1)   Erosion control shall be provided during the construction phase on
all construction sites as necessary to prevent impacts to offsite areas and/or
public rights-of-way. The primary goal of erosion control and best management
practices is to minimize erosion and sedimentation during construction
activities until final grading, landscaping and storm sewer structures are in
place. Best management practices include but are not limited to seeding,
sodding, sprigging, silt fences, straw bale dikes, earth dikes or swales,
temporary stream crossings, storm sewer inlet protection, temporary sediment
basins and stabilized construction entrances. Failure to provide sediment and
erosion control protection can result in suspension of the earth change,
stormwater development and building permits. A violation of this section by the
failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute an offense and
any person or entity convicted thereof shall be punishable as set forth in
Claremore Code. Provided, that each lot upon which such violation occurs shall
constitute a separate offense; and each day on which a violation occurs or is
allowed to remain shall constitute a separate offense. The imposition of
criminal sections shall not prevent Claremore from taking any lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy a violation.
      (2)   Sediment and Erosion Control Permit.
         (a)   Unless specifically exempted, a Sediment and Erosion Control
Permit, as defined and regulated by this section, shall be obtained from the

for the period during which the proposed land disturbing or filling activities
and soil storage takes place or is scheduled to take place, whichever is
shorter, but in no event shall such a permit be valid for more than one year
after cessation of construction activity.
         (j)   Responsibility of permittee. The permittee shall maintain a copy
of the Sediment and Erosion Control Permit, approved plans and reports required
under the Sediment and Erosion Control Permit on the work site, or if unable to
store on the work site, must be locally available for public inspection during
all working hours. The permittee shall, at all times, be in conformity with the
approved Sediment and Erosion Control Plan and also conform to the following:
            1.   General. Notwithstanding other conditions or provisions of the
Sediment and Erosion Control Permit, or the minimum standards set forth in this
section, the permittee is responsible for the prevention of damage to adjacent
property. No person shall grade on land in any manner, or so close to the
property line as to endanger or damage any adjoining public street, sidewalk,
alley or any other public or private property without supporting and protecting
such property from settling, cracking, erosion, sedimentation or other damage
or personal injury which might result; and
            2.   Public ways. The permittee shall be responsible for the prompt
removal of, and the correction of damages resulting from any soil,
miscellaneous debris or other materials washed, spilled, tracked, dumped or
otherwise deposited on public streets, highways, sidewalks or other public
thoroughfare, incident to the construction activity, or during transit to and
from the construction site.
         (k)   Liability. The permittee is responsible for safely and legally
completing the project. Neither the issuance of a Sediment and Erosion Control
Permit under the provisions of this section, nor the compliance with the
provisions hereto or with any condition imposed by the city, shall relieve any
person from responsibility for damage to persons or property resulting
therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor impose any liability upon the
city for damages to persons or property.
         (l)   Action upon noncompliance.
            1.   In the event work does not conform to the Sediment and Erosion
Control Permit or to the plans and specifications or to any conditions imposed
by the city, notice to comply shall be given to the permittee in writing. The
notice shall set forth a notification and compliance period of at least 15 days
for the permittee to comply with the requirements of the notice, except that
when an imminent hazard exists, the Planning and Development Services
Department may require that corrective work begin immediately. The notification
and compliance period will begin on the day the notice is mailed to the
permittee or the day the notice is posted on the property that is not
conforming to the permit requirements, except that when an imminent hazard
exists, the Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector may order an
immediate summary abatement action to abate the violation. At the time of
mailing of notice, the city shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the Postal
Service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and
address of the mailee. Said notice shall further advise that, should the
permittee fail to comply with the requirements of the notice by the established
deadline, the work necessary to achieve compliance may be done by the city or a
designated contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the
permittee. Issuance of a notice to comply shall not be a prerequisite to taking
any other enforcement action.
            2.   If the city finds any existing conditions not as stated in the
application or approved plans, the Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater
Inspector may issue a stop-work order requiring that all construction
activities halt when a construction site is in violation of this section. The
stop-work order may apply to all construction activity on the subject property
which may be directly or indirectly related to site drainage and which is being
performed pursuant to any permits, licenses, franchises or contracts issued or
approved by the city. The stop-work order may order a work stoppage on all
construction activity on buildings or structures and appurtenances thereto,
including but not limited to building, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, street
work, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, gas lines, and all utilities including but
not limited to gas, electric, telephone and cable television. The Planning and
Development Services Department may also suspend or revoke any Sediment and
Erosion Control, site preparation, grading, erosion control, earth change,
construction, or any other permit when any part of this section is violated.
            3.   The violation of any provision of this section, upon
conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or 30 days in
jail, or both, plus court costs as set by the city. Each day or any portion of
a day during which any violation of this section shall continue shall
constitute a separate offense.
            4.   Other actions described in the penalties and administrative
remedies section of this chapter may be taken by the city, including but not
limited to suspension of MS4 access, water supply severance, injunctive relief,
abatement, remediation, and restoration of lands. The permittee shall be
responsible for the costs incurred by the city. Failure to pay will result in
the city seeking recovery of costs and damages pursuant to the conditions set
forth in this chapter.
         (m)   Changes to plans. All proposals to modify the approved Sediment
and Erosion Control Plans must be submitted in writing to the Planning and
Development Services Department. No grading or any type of work in connection
with any proposed modification shall be initiated without prior written
approval of the Planning and Development Services Department.
         (n)   Inspection and supervision. The city shall conduct construction
site inspections upon receiving a complaint of violation of this section and as
needed to evaluate compliance with this section. The permittee shall notify the
Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector when there are any departures
from the approved Sediment and Erosion Control Plan and at the following
stages:
            1.   Upon completion of installa- tion of perimeter sediment and
erosion controls;
            2.   At least 24 hours but not more than 72 hours (exclusive of
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) prior to commencing initial grading or land
disturbing activities;
            3.   When construction and land disturbing activities are halted
for a period of 30 days or more;
            4.   At least 24 hours but not more than 72 hours (exclusive of
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) prior to when construction or land disturbing
activities shall recommence after being halted for a period of 30 days or more;
            5.   Upon submitting a notice of termination to ODEQ in compliance
with any OKR10 permit requirements; and
            6.   Upon completion of final grading, permanent drainage and
erosion control facilities including established ground covers and planting,
and all other work of the permit.
         (o)   Maintenance during and after construction. For any property on
which grading or other work has been done, pursuant to a Sediment and Erosion
Control Permit granted under the provisions of this section, the permittee or
owner or an agent of the owner shall inspect all sediment and erosion control
measures and other protective measures identified in the Sediment and Erosion
Control Plan at least once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of the
end of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater and shall maintain and repair all
sediment and erosion control measures, graded surfaces and erosion control
facilities, drainage structures or means and other protective devices,
plantings, and ground cover installed while construction is active. After
construction is complete, the owner or their agent shall continue to regularly
inspect the vegetation until adequate turf establishment or other suitable
vegetative cover is established.

      (10)   In the event that the owner or responsible party fails to properly
operate or maintain the stormwater drainage system such that negative
stormwater quality or quantity impacts to stormwater drainage systems and/or
receiving streams either on the subject property or on offsite properties
occurs or is imminent, the city or its designated contractor may enter the
property to perform required operations or maintenance, and the cost shall be
paid by the owner of responsible party.
   (B)   Allowing construction materials to spill onto public ways. No person
shall place, spill or allow the flow of concrete or similar construction
materials on any public road, alley, highway or sidewalk, except as may be
required for the construction or the maintenance of the public road, street,
highway or sidewalk.
   (C)   Construction debris.
      (1)   Construction debris shall not be allowed to blow off the site of
origin.
      (2)   Trash containers of sufficient size, but not less than four feet
wide by four feet deep by four feet high, shall be located on each construction
site no later than the time the rough plumbing is ready for inspection.
   (D)   Responsible person.
      (1)   Any person with overall responsibility for the construction, such
as the general contractor, shall be jointly responsible with the person at
whose direction the construction is conducted, for purpose of compliance with
divisions (A) through (C) of this section.

may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2015-29, passed 11-16-15)
§ 55.07B MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   The Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector shall be permitted
to enter facilities, premises, watercourses and waterways subject to regulation
under this chapter for the purpose of observing, measuring, sampling, testing
and inspecting as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with
chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger
shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
authorized enforcement agency.
   (B)   Facility operators shall allow the Stormwater Manager and/or
Stormwater Inspector ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes
of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES or OPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and
the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
Any permits, pollution prevention plans, or other documents regarding a
facility’s stormwater discharge shall be made available to the Stormwater
Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector when requested.
   (C)   The Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector shall have the
right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the
opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge.
   (D)   The Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector has the right to
require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Stormwater Manager and/or
Stormwater Inspector and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the operator.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Stormwater Manager and/or
Stormwater Inspector access to a permitted facility is a violation of a
Stormwater Discharge Permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator
of a facility with a NPDES permit or an OPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
   (G)   If the Stormwater Manager and/or Stormwater Inspector has been refused
access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the
city is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as
part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance
with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

the notification requirements specified within this section. These reporting
requirements shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other reporting
requirements imposed under federal, state and local laws or regulations.
   (D)   Reports. All persons or industrial facilities may be required to
provide other reports deemed necessary by the Director to monitor, maintain and
ensure compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 2007-25, passed 11-19-07)
§ 55.10 COMPLIANCE MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Stormwater sampling event criteria.  When the Director requires that a
sample of a storm event be obtained, the following criteria must be met:
      (1)   The depth of the rainfall must be greater than one-tenth inch or
its equivalent;
      (2)   The sample storm event must be preceded by at least 72 hours of
less than one-tenth inch of rainfall; and
      (3)   All point sources from the premises or industry required to sample
must be sampled, unless otherwise specified.
   (B)   Sampling.  When the Director has reason to believe that any person or

facility may be required to obtain either a grab or composite sample and
analyze any discharge, stormwater, groundwater and/or sediment and provide a
copy of the analysis to the Director for review.
   (C)   Illicit discharge sampling. When the Director has cause to believe
that any discharge is an illicit discharge, the Director may obtain either a
grab or composite sample and analyze the discharge. If the Director determines
that the discharge is an illicit discharge, then the Director may fully recover
all cost of the sampling and analysis from the person or industrial facility.
When the discharge is likely to contain illicit discharges on a recurring
basis, the person or industrial facility may be required by the Director to
conduct monitoring activities at its expense.
   (D)   Chain-of-custody. Upon completion of sample collections and
documentation, a written record of the chain-of-custody must be completed. The
chain-of-custody record is an accurate step-by- step documentation of the
sampling path from origin
through analysis. It must contain the following information:
      (1)   Name of the person(s) collecting the sample;
      (2)   Sample ID numbers;
      (3)   Date and time of sample collection;
      (4)   Location of sample collection;
      (5)   Name(s) and signature(s) of all persons handling the sample in the
field and in the laboratory;
      (6)   Type of sampling equipment used;

industry is required to sample a storm event and that person or industry has
two or more point sources with substantially identical effluents, the person or
industry may petition the Director to allow the sampling of only one point
source and report that the data apply to the substantially identical point
source(s).
   (F)   Monitoring methods. Monitoring must be conducted according to test
procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136, unless other test procedures have
been specified by the Director.
(Ord. 2007-25, passed 11-19-07)
§ 55.11 REQUIREMENTS FOR BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (A)   Implementation.  If the Director determines that a stormwater
discharge into the MS4 is, or has the potential of, contributing to water
quality degradation, has potential to cause any violation of this chapter or,
causes a violation of the city’s OPDES Municipal Storm Water Discharge Permit,
a BMP shall be implemented. The type and number of BMPs shall be addressed
individually, with the initial implementation of nonstructural BMPs, followed
by structural BMPs. The Director may require additional BMPs to be implemented
for any discharge from a commercial, residential and industrial source.
   (B)   Spill BMPs. All persons and industrial facilities shall take measures
to prevent spills or any other accidental introduction of pollutants into the
MS4. These measures shall take the form of BMPs.
(Ord. 2007-25, passed 11-19-07)

available to the owner or person in charge of such premises, after finalization
of the inspection report.
(Ord. 2007-25, passed 11-19-07)
§ 55.13 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   The following enforcement provisions are intended to encourage compliance
with this chapter.
   (A)   Investigation.  The Director or authorized representative may
investigate any premises where there is reason to believe that there may be a
failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Notice of violations.  Whenever the Director determines that a
violation of this chapter has occurred or is occurring, the Director may issue
a notice of violation (NOV) to the person or industry. This NOV shall include
the nature of the violation and provide a reasonable time for correction. The
Director may require, within 15 days of the receipt of this NOV, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention, including specific required actions.
The explanation and plan shall be submitted by the violator to the Director in
writing. Submission of this plan shall in no way relieve the person or industry
of liability for any violation(s) occurring before or after receipt of the NOV.
Issuance of a NOV shall not preclude any other enforcement action.
   (C)   Administrative orders.
      (1)   Consent orders. The Director is empowered to enter consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing a
consensus with any person or industry for noncompliance. Such an order shall
include specific action to be taken by the violator to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified in the order. Consent orders shall
be judicially enforceable.
      (2)   Compliance orders. When the Director finds that a person or
industry has violated or continues to violate this chapter or orders issued
hereunder, the Director may issue an order to the violator directing that
compliance be obtained within a specified time period. If compliance is not
achieved within the time period, water service or sewer service, or both
services may be discontinued, unless adequate BMPs or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also
contain other requirements addressing noncompliance, including additional self-
monitoring. A compliance order shall not extend the deadline for compliance
established by a federal standard or requirement, nor shall a compliance order
release the violator from liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not preclude any other
enforcement action.
      (3)   Cease and desist orders.  When the Director finds that a person or
industry is violating provisions of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, or that past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue
an order directing the violator to cease and desist all such violations or
activities likely to cause a recurrence, and to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive actions as may be
necessary to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations or terminating the discharge.
      (4)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not preclude other
action against the violator.
      (5)   Administrative orders may be revised by the Director at any time in
order to insure compliance with this chapter.
   (D)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the Director finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of the chapter, or order issued hereunder, the Director,
upon good cause shown, may impose an administrative fine against such user in
an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines may be assessed on a per violation,
per day basis.
      (2)   Notice of an administrative fine shall be served personally on the
user or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Payment of the fine shall
be received by the Director within 15 days after such notice is served.
      (3)   Failure to submit payment for an administrative fine within 15 days
shall be considered a violation of this chapter.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Director may require
any person and or industry found to have violated any provision of this
chapter, or orders issued hereunder, to reimburse the city for any goods or
services used to remove pollutants from the city’s MS4, prevent further
discharge of pollutants into the MS4, and shall become liable to the city for
any expense, loss, or damages experienced by the city as a result of a
violation. The city may pursue its right of action to recover all such costs,
by utilizing any and all reasonable methods, including installment payment
administered by the Finance Department. The city may recover the costs incurred
by adding them to the utility bill of the violator or filing a lien on the
subject property.
   (F)   Water supply severance.  Whenever a person has violated, or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, or orders issued hereunder, water
service may be severed. Service shall only recommence at the violator’s
expense, after the violator has satisfactorily demonstrated an ability to
comply, and actual compliance.

issued by the Director pursuant to this section may appeal the action as
provided in this section.
      (1)   The initiation of an appeal shall be in writing and filed with the
Director no later than 15 days after service of notice of the action appealed
from. The written notice of appeal shall specify the action appealed, detail
why the action is in error, and specify provision of ordinances or statutes
supporting the person’s appeal.
      (2)   Upon receipt of a notice of appeal by the Director, the Director
shall conduct any necessary investigation into the basis of the appeal and hold
a hearing within 30 days of receipt. However, upon review of the notice of
appeal, if the Director determines that the basis of the appeal is patently
frivolous or filed only for purposes of delay, then the Director may deny the
appeal without a hearing. Upon the Director’s denial without a hearing, the
appellant shall be notified in writing of the denial and the grounds for
denial.
      (3)   At the conclusion of a hearing on an appeal, if the appeal is
sustained in favor of the appellant, the Director may modify or withdraw the
notice, fine or order. If the Director fails to act on the appeal within 30
days of concluding the hearing, the appeal shall be deemed denied. Any ruling,

evidence in any civil action or proceeding for damages unless the plaintiff in
such action or proceeding is a child under 16 years of age.
   (F)   In any action brought by or on behalf of an infant for personal

(47 O.S. § 11-201(b)) (`83 Code, § 15-604)
§ 70.54 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   The display of signal lights, arrows and words shall be deemed to have the
following meanings and requires the appropriate response on the part of
vehicular traffic and pedestrians:
   (A)   Green alone, “Go.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless an official sign at such
place prohibits such turn, but any vehicle and any pedestrian lawfully within
the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal displays green
shall have the right-of-way over such vehicular traffic; and
      (2)   Pedestrian traffic, facing a green signal may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless a “Walk” signal
indicator is operating.
   (B)   Steady yellow or amber alone, “Caution.”
      (1)   The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute a
warning that the “Red” or “Stop” signal will be exhibited immediately
thereafter; and
      (2)   Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near side
crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so near
the limit line when the “caution” signal first flashes that a stop cannot be
made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the
intersection and clear the same before the “red” signal flashes.
   (C)   Red alone, “Stop.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk and shall remain standing until green or “go” is shown alone. Except
where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns, vehicles in the right
traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may enter the intersection
cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield the right-of-
way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection and the turn shall
be made so as not to interfere in any way with traffic proceeding on a green
signal indication on the cross street; and
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the roadway
when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal
indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety.
No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or
“go” is shown alone unless authorized to do so, by a pedestrian “walk” signal.
   (D)   Steady red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic
lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated
by the arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the movement
indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be made only
on the red with green arrow signal; and
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or “go” is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian “walk”
signal.
   (E)   Green arrows alone. Whenever vehicular traffic movements are
controlled by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal
indication, vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by
the green arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are
displayed.

§ 70.55 PEDESTRIANS; SIGNAL INDICATORS; REGULATIONS.
   Special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words “Walk”, “Wait” or
“Don't Walk” shall regulate pedestrian movement as follows:
   (A)   “Walk.” Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the
drivers of all vehicles; and
   (B)   “Wait” or “Don't Walk.” No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway
in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
his crossing on the “Walk” signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone
while the “Wait” signal is showing.

   (A)   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is showing, it
shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
      (1)   “Flashing red.” When a red light is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject
to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign; and
      (2)   “Flashing yellow.” When a yellow light is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection,
or past such signal only with caution.
   (B)   This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings.

Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.57 PEDESTRIAN-ACTUATED SCHOOL CROSSING SIGNALS.
   Whenever a pedestrian-actuated school crossing signal is provided, it
requires obedience by vehicular traffic and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   “Flashing yellow.”
      (1)   When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers, or operators of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or pass
such signal only with caution; and
      (2)   Pedestrians shall not proceed in conflict with traffic, but may
activate the signal control switch, and shall wait until steady red alone is
shown before entering the roadway or intersection controlled by the signal.
   (B)   “Steady yellow alone.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or “Stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection or pass the signal when
the red or “Stop” signal is exhibited; and
      (2)   No pedestrian shall enter the roadway or intersection on which the
signal controls vehicular traffic until steady red alone is shown.
   (C)   “Steady red.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and shall remain standing until
flashing yellow is shown alone; and
      (2)   Pedestrians may proceed across the road controlled by the signal,
and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
   (D)   “Steady red and steady yellow combined.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
flashing yellow signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and that such
vehicular traffic shall remain standing until the flashing yellow is shown
alone; and
      (2)   Pedestrians are thereby warned that the flashing yellow signal is
about to be shown and shall not enter the signal-controlled roadway or
intersection or in a direction which conflicts with the movement of vehicular
traffic, but any pedestrian who has partially completed crossing shall proceed
to the nearest sidewalk or safety island and shall be given the right-of-way by
the drivers of all vehicles.

railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic,
or which projects any flashing or revolving beams of light, or which hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic-control
device or any railroad sign or signal.
   (B)   No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any highway any traffic sign, signal, or device bearing thereon any
commercial advertising.

which because of the size or location of the parcel cannot be provided on the
same zoning lot with the principal use, may be provided on other property not
more than 200 feet distant from the building site. Such parking space shall be
deemed to be required parking associated with permitted principal use and shall

residential use, off-street parking shall be provided on the same tract,
adjacent to said tract, or essentially inline with same tract across the alley
or street right-of-way therefrom but not more than 200 feet distant from the
building site.

location, arrangement, and dimensions of the off-street parking, turning
spaces, drives, aisles, and ingress and egress in a matter satisfactory for the
safety and convenience of pedestrian, as well as vehicular, traffic. The plans
must also show landscaping materials and screening. A title block will
accompany the plan showing: scale date, north arrow, name and address of
property owner, and person drawing parking and landscaping plan.
      (2)   Size. Each space shall be at least 8 ½ feet wide and 19 feet long.
      (3)   Access. Adequate access drive shall be provided for all parking
spaces not abutting a public street or alley. Ingress and egress driveways
shall be no wider than 30 feet for residential uses, and 35 feet for

all open off-street parking areas with more than five spaces that are located
within 20 feet of a common property line shall be screened from any adjoining
residentially zoned lot by a solid and opaque ornamental fence, wall, dense
evergreen hedge, berm, or effective equivalent or combination, having a height
of not less than six feet. Such fence, wall, hedge, or effective equivalent
shall be maintained in good condition.
      (5)   Improvement.
         (a)   Surfacing, Marking and Drainage.  All off-street parking spaces
and their access roads shall be paved with an all-weather surface of asphaltic
concrete, portland cement concrete or any equivalent material acceptable to the
City Engineer and maintained such that no dust will result from continued use.
Spaces shall be arranged and marked so as to provide for orderly and safe
parking. Drainage shall be provided to dispose of all surface water without
crossing sidewalks.
         (b)   Barriers/Bumpers. Except for parking areas provided for single-
family and two-family units, suitable barriers or curbs shall be provided to
protect public sidewalks. Wheel or bumper guards shall be located so that no
part of any vehicle shall extend beyond the parking area, intrude on pedestrian
ways, or come in contact with walls, fences or plantings.
         (c)   Lighting. Lighting for off-street parking shall be adequate and
so arranged as to direct the light away from any adjoining property in a
residential district.
         (d)   Landscaping. From the effective date of this section, all new
off-street parking areas with six or more spaces shall be landscaped. For
enlarged parking areas, only the increment of expansion shall be subject to
landscaping requirements.
         (e)   Waiver of Surfacing Requirements for the Handicapped. The
Planning Director may, upon written request, consider a waiver of surfacing
requirements which would permit persons with a handicap to park their vehicles
on unimproved front or side yard surfaces in order to allow access to a walkway
suitable for safe transport to their dwelling unit. Consideration will be given
only to individuals that qualify for Emergency Access Grant funds as
administered by the city and to owners of vehicles currently displaying a
handicapped person decal. The applicant shall, in writing, describe why he/she
is unable to comply with this section and what special needs will be met
through a waiver. After review of the letter of application, the Planning
Director shall either approve or deny the request. The Director's decision may
be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
   (C)   Additional requirements for parking lots permitted as a special use
and for parking lots for uses adjacent to a residential use or district. In any
case where (1) special use is granted for the use of property for off-street
parking in a residential district, or (2) when parking is provided for a
commercial, industrial or church use and abuts or faces a residential district,
or (3) when parking is provided for a multifamily use abutting or facing a
single-family use or district, the following restrictions shall apply:
      (1)   The sides and rear of any such lot shall be screened from the
residential district by a solid and opaque ornamental fence, wall, dense
evergreen hedge, berm, or effective equivalent, having a height of not less
than six feet. Such fence, wall, hedge, or effective equivalent shall be
maintained in good condition and observe the setback requirements of division
(2) below.
      (2)   No parking shall be permitted within a front yard setback line
established 20 feet back on the property line of interior and corner lots
wherever the parking lot immediately abuts or is directly across the street
from the front yard of a residential unit.
      (3)   All yards shall be landscaped with grass, shrubs, or evergreen
ground cover and maintained in good condition the year around.
      (4)   Any lighting that is installed shall have minimal impact on
abutting properties. All lights must be shielded or oriented so that the light
source does not shine onto nor is visible from any abutting property or right-
of-way.
   (D)   No person shall park, stop or stand any motor vehicle in the space
between the curb line of the street and the private property line on any street
unless there be an approved cutback especially provided for such purpose. This
requirement as to cutback shall not apply where there is no permanent curb, and
this section shall not be construed to prevent parking of vehicles outside of
the front property line of commercial parking lots or outside of the front
property line of residential property where commercial parking is allowed as a
use permissible on certain days or as special use. In the event the owner of
any land lying between the right-of-way lines of the street and setback lines
of his tract desires to surface with concrete or asphalt he shall first submit
the plans and specifications of the proposed cut, paving, drainage, and lot
design to the City Engineer for the Engineer's approval.

§ 92.32 COMMERCIAL ANIMAL ESTABLISHMENTS.
   (A)   Each commercial animal establishment of any type shall keep and

which animals are kept in such a manner as to prevent a nuisance or health
hazard to humans and to avoid injury and minimize illness to such animals. All
holding areas shall be disinfected periodically (minimum of once daily) to
reduce disease pathogens. A commercial animal establishment is not a commercial
breeder’s license. One must obtain a commercial breeder’s license from the
State of Oklahoma. No Type A establishment shall operate except veterinarian
clinics without this permit. If the animal establishment of any kind is not
being kept in compliance with this chapter, the establishment shall receive a
summons and notice to the owner-business manager, for a hearing, whereby the
judge of the municipal court will determine the conclusion of a hearing. The
establishment then:
      (1)   Has a set amount of time by the municipal court to comply with this
chapter;
      (2)   Could be put on a six month probation period. During that time if
the establishment receives three or more valid complaints the establishment
shall go before the municipal court a second time to pull their license
permanently; and
      (3)   Is subject to having the commercial license revoked due to failure
to comply.
   (B)   All animals housed in any commercial animal establishment shall have a
wholesome, adequate diet and potable water consistent with the requirements and
habits of the animal’s species, type, size, age and condition. Available
shelter that meets the requirements of the animals size and habitat with
adequate ventilation and protection from the elements. Such animal showing
evidence of disease or injury shall be immediately isolated and shall receive
treatment by a licensed veterinarian or euthanized by same. Euthanasia of any
domestic animal shall be performed by a licensed veterinarian. The reason and
the procedure used for such euthanasia shall be documented. Upon receipt of a
signed report or complaint alleging animal abuse or other conditions not in
compliance with this chapter at any commercial animal establishment, an
investigation shall be made by Animal Control. Its findings shall be documented
and appropriate action taken.
   (C)   Commercial Establishment A includes, but is not limited to, stables,
boarding facilities, grooming, bathing facilities, carriage horse or pony
service or sentry or guard dog service. All operators of a Type A establishment
shall apply to the City Clerk for a permit to operate such establishment in the
city. No Type A establishment shall operate except veterinarian clinics without
this permit. There will be two inspections; one before the permit is issued and
one three months after the establishment is open to the public. The Type A
establishments must have a veterinarian on contract with their facility to
ensure the safe keeping of the public’s pets. The City Clerk shall perform a
background check encompassing the past ten years, to ascertain if the applicant
has been convicted of animal abuse, animal cruelty or other city charges in
that time. Conviction of any animal charges shall be grounds for denial or
revocation of a commercial animal establishment permit. The permit fee shall be
$50 annually. An application processing fee of $20 shall be assessed for the
first application. If the applicant is a corporation, then the background check
required by this subsection will be done on the manager of the establishment,
and the city has the ability to do a background check on any employee that
directly handles animals at this establishment. Each time the manager of the
establishment changes, a new background check will be required and a background
check fee of $20 shall be assessed.
   (D)   Commercial Establishment B includes, but is not limited to, any
business keeping animals in stock for retail or wholesale trade, wholesale
distributors, pet stores, stockyards, breeders and hatcheries. All operators of
a Type B establishment shall apply to the City Clerk for a permit to operate
such establishment in the city. The City Clerk shall perform a background check
encompassing the past ten years, to ascertain if the applicant has been
convicted of animal abuse, animal cruelty or other city charges in that time.
Conviction of any animal charges shall be grounds for denial or revocation of a
commercial animal establishment permit. The applicant shall provide proof that
the establishment has a veterinarian on contract to see the animals. There will
be two inspections: one before the permit is issued and one three months after
the establishment is open to the public. The permit fee shall be $50 annually.
An application processing fee of $20 shall be assessed for the first
application. If the applicant is a corporation, then the background check
required by this subsection will be done on the manager of the establishment,
and the city has the ability to do a background check on any employee that
directly handles animals at this establishment. Each time the manager of the
establishment changes, a new background check will be required and a background
check fee of $20 shall be assessed.
   (E)   Type B establishments must have on the premises all registration
papers for animals kept on the premises. Registration papers may include, but
not limited to, where the animals were purchased or breeders name and the state
where the animal was born, or animals origin except those when attached to a
contract of sale. All vaccination (including, but not limited to, rabies and
first distemper, parvo, leptospira and grippotyphosa) shot and other medical
care of such animals shall be current and the purchaser shall receive a
complete health record on the animal purchased. The establishment shall upon
request from an Animal Control Officer provide proof of such documents. The
establishment must have a “quarantine area” for sick or injured animals. This
area is to be separate from the healthy animals and public to prevent the
spread of any disease or illness. If not in compliance the establishment is
found to be in violation of this chapter. At no time are the animals allowed to
be outside for showing of sale. There are no kennels allowed to be placed
outside the establishment. All animals are to be kept inside the establishment
to avoid any nuisance to the public. All of the reptiles and rodents must be
kept in appropriate cages to avoid escape. Any establishment that sells any
animal found to be illegal in the city ordinances, state or federal laws will
result in their permit being revoked.

§ 96.18 ABATEMENT OF WEEDS AND TRASH; NOTICE; PROCEDURE; COLLECTION; LIEN.
   The municipal governing body of the city may cause property within the
municipal limits to be cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed
in accordance with the following procedures:
   (A)   At least ten days' notice shall be given to the owner of the property
by mail at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the County
Treasurer's office before the governing body holds a hearing or takes action.
The notice shall order the property owner to clean the property of trash, or to
cut or mow the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate, and the notice
shall further state that unless such work is performed within ten days of the
date of the notice the work shall be done by the municipality and a notice of
lien shall be filed with the County Clerk against the property for the costs
due and owing the municipality. At the time of mailing of notice to the
property owner, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the
postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name
and address of mailee. How-ever, if the property owner cannot be located within
ten days from the date of mailing by the municipal governing body, notice may
be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property or by publication, as
defined in 11 O.S. § 1-102, one time not less than ten days prior to any
hearing or action by the municipality. If the municipal governing body
anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the provisions
of §
96.19 of this chapter, the notice, whether by certified mail, posting or
publication, shall state:
      (1)   That any accumulations of trash or excessive weed or grass growth
on the owner's property occurring within six months after the removal of trash
or cutting or mowing of weeds or grass on the property pursuant to such notice
may be summarily abated by the municipal governing body;
      (2)   That the costs of such abatement shall be assessed against the
owner; and
      (3)   That a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment,
all without further prior notice to the property owner.
   (B)   The owner of the property may give his written consent to the city
authorizing the removal of the trash or the mowing of the weeds or grass. By
giving the written consent, the owner waives his right to a hearing by the
municipality.
   (C)   A hearing may be held by the municipal governing body to determine
whether the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass has caused
the property to become detrimental to the health, benefit, and welfare of the
public and the community or a hazard to traffic, or creates a fire hazard to
the danger of property.
   (D)   Upon a finding that the condition of the property constitutes a
detriment or hazard, and that the property would be benefitted by the removal
of such conditions, the agents of the municipality are granted the right of
entry on the property for the removal of trash, mowing of weeds or grass, and
performance of the necessary duties as a governmental function of the
municipality. Immediately following the cleaning or mowing of the property, the
Municipal Clerk shall file a notice of lien with the County Clerk's office
describing the property and the work performed by the municipality, and stating
that the municipality claims a lien on the property for the cleaning or mowing
costs.
   (E)   The governing body shall determine the actual cost of such cleaning
and mowing and any other expenses as may be necessary in connection therewith,
including the cost of notice and mailing. The Municipal Clerk shall forward by
mail to the property owner specified in division (A) of this section a
statement of such actual cost and demanding payment. If the cleaning and mowing
are done by the municipality, the cost to the property owner for the cleaning
and mowing shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, maintenance and
equipment required. If the cleaning and mowing are done on private contract
basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder.
   (F)   If payment is not made within 30 days from the date of the mailing of
the statement, the Municipal Clerk shall forward a certified statement of the
amount of the cost to the County Treasurer in which the property is located and
the same shall be levied on the property and collected by the County Treasurer
as other taxes authorized by law. Once certified by the County Treasurer,
payment may only be made to the County Treasurer except as otherwise provided
by this subchapter. Until fully paid, the cost and the interest thereon shall
be the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date the
cost is certified to the County Treasurer. In addition, the cost and the
interest thereon shall be a lien against the property from the date the cost is
certified to the County Treasurer, coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes
and all other taxes and special assessments and prior and superior to all other
titles and liens against the property, and the lien shall continue until the
cost shall be fully paid. At the time of collection, the County Treasurer shall
collect a fee of $5 for each parcel of property. The fee shall be deposited to
the credit of the general fund of the county. If the County Treasurer and the
municipality agree that the County Treasurer is unable to collect the
assessment, the municipality may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the
amount owing and interest thereon including an action in personam against the
property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property.
A mineral interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the
surface owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created
pursuant to this section. Upon receiving payment, if any, the Municipal Clerk
shall forward to the County Treasurer a notice of such payment and directing
discharge of the lien.
   (G)   The city may designate by ordinance an administrative officer or
administrative body to carry out the duties of the governing body in this
section. The property owner shall have a right to appeal to the municipal
governing body from any order of the administrative officer or administrative
body. Such appeal shall be taken by filing written notice of appeal with the
Municipal Clerk within ten days after the administrative order is rendered.

   (A)   If a notice is given by the City Council to a property owner ordering
the property within the municipal limits to be cleaned of trash and weeds, or
grass to be cut or mowed, in accordance with the procedures provided for in
§ 96.18 of this code, any subsequent accumulation of trash or excessive weed or
grass growth on the property occurring within a six-month period may be
declared to be a nuisance and may be summarily abated without further prior
notice to the property owner. At the time of each such summary abatement, the
municipality shall notify the property owner of the abatement and the costs
thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request a hearing
within ten days after the date of mailing the notice. The notice and hearing
shall be as provided for in
§ 96.18 of this code. Unless otherwise determined at the hearing the costs of
such abatement shall be determined and collected as provided for in divisions
(E) and (F) of

same manner as other taxes and fees. The local exchange telephone company shall
annually provide the govern-ing body of the city with a list of amounts

to be nonpayment of any fee imposed pursuant to the authority of this
subchapter.
   (B)   All fees collected by a local exchange telephone company pursuant to
this subchapter shall be remitted to the city, together with any accumulated
interest, no later than 30 days, after the close of the month in which the fees
were collected. Such remittance shall be submitted with a return on a form
acceptable to the city and the local exchange telephone company.
   (C)   The local exchange telephone company shall maintain a complete and
accurate set of records on the amount of any fees collected. Such records shall
be maintained for a period of one year from the end of any fiscal year in which

audit of such records.
   (D)   All fees collected by the local exchange telephone company and
remitted to the City Council and any other money collected to fund the

shall be used to fund the expenditures authorized by the 911 emergency number
system.

§ 98.07 SUMMARY ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances may be
such as to justify, and even to require the Mayor or other appropriate officer
or agency of the city government to take immediate and proper action summarily
to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more
deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   (B)   The Chief of the Fire Department, the Chief of Police, the City
Attorney, the Building Inspector, the Electrical Inspector, the Plumbing
Inspector, or any other officer subordinate to the Mayor may submit through or
with the consent of the Mayor to the City Council, a statement as to the
existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or law, and a
request or recommendation that it be abated. The Mayor himself, the Health
Officer, any Council person, or any resident or residents of the city may
submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the City Council.
   (C)   The Council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a
nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the
Council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and
other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the
Council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner
of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible
for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if
such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the
owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by
service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the
names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be
published in a paper of general circulation within the city.
   (D)   If the Council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
it within the specified time, the Council shall direct the Mayor to abate the
nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized
by 50 O.S. § 16. The City Clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such
summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the
nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses
are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city
collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.
(`83 Code, § 8-508)
§ 98.08 ABATEMENT BY SUIT IN DISTRICT COURT.
   In cases where it is deemed impractical sum-marily to abate a nuisance, the
city may bring suit in the district court of the county where the nuisance is
located, as provided in 50 O.S. § 17.
(`83 Code, § 8-509)
§ 98.09 NUISANCE UNLAWFUL.
   It is unlawful for any person, including but not limited to any owner,
lessee, or other person to create or maintain a nuisance within the city or to
permit a nuisance to remain on premises under his control within the city.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 98.10 HEALTH NUISANCES; ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 O.S. § 1-1011, the Health Officer
shall have authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises in
the city to remove from such premises, at his own expense, any source of filth,
cause of sickness, con-dition conducive to the breeding of insects or rodents
that might contribute to the transmission of disease, or any other condition
adversely affecting the public health, within 24 hours, or within such other
time as may be reasonable, and a failure to do so shall con-stitute an offense.
Such order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the owner or
occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the Health Officer or
by a police officer, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of
abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state. If the
premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is
unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy
thereof on the premises, or by publication in at least one issue of a newspaper
having a general circulation in the city.
   (B)   If the order is not complied with, the Health Officer may cause the
order to be executed and com-plied with, and the cost thereof shall be
certified to the City Clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance
shall be added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or
occupant if he is a user of water from the city water system or such other
utility service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to
which it is added, and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same
regulations relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If
such owner or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost,
after certification to the City Clerk, may be collected in any manner in which
any other debt due the city may be collected.

whatever loose, soft, spongy or foamy soil is found in the subgrade shall be
removed to such an additional depth as may be directed by the City Engineer,
and shall be refilled with good material and the whole subgrade well compacted
by ramming. All such excavations and refillings shall be included in the
contract price for the sidewalk. All refuse material shall be removed from the
line of work. After the grading is done, a foundation of cinders or mill-
tailings, not less than six inches thick, shall be placed upon the subgrading,
which shall be consolidated by ramming, to an even surface, and moistened just
before the concrete is placed thereon. After the subfoundation has been
finished, the artificial stone flagging shall be laid in good workmanlike
manner, the same to consist of two parts: first, bottom course to be of 4½
inches in depth; second, a finishing or wearing course, to be one inch in
depth. The bottom course shall be composed of mill-tailing or broken limestone,
and the best portland cement and capable of withstanding a tensile strength of
400 pounds to a square inch of ten having been three hours in the air and seven
days in water, and shall be mixed in the proportion of one part of cement to
five parts of mill-tailings or broken limestone which shall consist of
irregular sharp-edged, broken pieces, so broken that each piece will pass
through a ¾-inch ring in all diameters, and which shall be free from dust and
dirt. The mill-tailings or limestone shall be mixed dry, then sufficient clear
water shall be slowly added by sprinkling while the material is constantly
stirred and worked up, and the stirring and mixing shall be continued until the
whole is thoroughly mixed. This mass shall be spread upon the subfoundation and
shall be rammed until the interstices are thoroughly filled with cement.
Particular care must be taken that the bottom course is well rammed and
consolidated along the outer edges. The slab or flag divisions shall be formed
by cutting the concrete entirely through on the required line as soon as laid;
the space made by the cutting tool shall be immediately filled with dry sand
and well rammed. After the bottom course is completed, the finishing or wearing
course shall be added. This shall consist of a stiff mortar composed of equal
parts of portland cement and river sand, free from loamy, earthy substance and
to be laid to a depth of one-inch, and to be carefully smoothed and troweled to
a perfectly smooth and even surface, which, after the first setting takes
place, must not be disturbed by additional rubbing. The surface shall then be
cut into flags, the marking to be directly over the joints in the concrete and
cut through the wearing surface. When the pavement is completed, it must be
covered for three days and kept moist by sprinkling.

mixed dry and then sufficient water added and the mixing continued until a
uniform composition, and the proper consistency, is produced. The concrete
shall then be put in place and well compacted by ramming with a 20-pound
rammer, until the moulds are full and curb is ready for surfacing. The entire
exposed surface of the curb shall be faced with mortar one inch in thickness,
composed of equal parts of portland cement and clean river sand floated and
troweled so as to give it a uniform surface, and the color throughout the work
shall be carried uniformly and the whole curb com-pleted while in a soft and

with one inch in thickness of facing or finish mortar, as shown by drawing in
the office of the City Engineer. The core or backing shall be constructed of
concrete compound of one part portland cement and four parts of mill-tailings
or broken limestone, which shall be well mixed dry, and then sufficient water
added and the mixing continued until a uniform composition and the proper
consistency is produced. The concrete shall then be put in place and well
compacted by ramming with a 20-pound rammer until the moulds are full and curb
is ready for surfacing. The entire exposed surface of the curb and gutter shall
be faced with mortar, one inch in thickness, composed of equal parts of
portland cement and clean river sand, floated and troweled so as to give a
uniform surface and color throughout. The work shall be carried on uniformly,
and the whole curb and gutter completed while in a soft and plastic state, so
that it will become a monogenous solid when set. Sections in the curb and
gutter shall not be less than six feet long, nor more than seven feet long. The
curb and gutter shall be constructed as shown on drawings on file in the office
of the City Engineer. The face corner of the curb shall be rounded to a radius
of two inches. The corner where curb meets the gutter shall be rounded to a

the facility that would cause the facility to no longer be in compliance with
the conditions of approval granted by the City Council.
            2.   Said notice shall include detailed information about the
nature of all such changes; and
            3.   Such changes shall cause the approval of the special use
permit to be revoked and become the basis for requiring submission of a new
application if the operation is to continue.
         (l)   Regardless of the preceding sections, upon obtaining approval
for colocation of a specified number of users on a particular facility by a
special use permit from the City Council, subsequent users up to the specified
number may be permitted by right upon demonstrating compliance with all
conditions of the original approval.

§ 150.120 REMOVAL AND ABATEMENT; NOTICE; PROCEDURES; LIEN.
   The municipal governing body may cause dilapi-dated buildings within the
municipal limits to be torn down and removed in accordance with the provisions
of this section.
   (A)   At least ten days' notice that a building is to be torn down or
removed shall be given to the owner of the property before the governing body
holds a hearing. A copy of the notice shall be posted on the property to be
affected. In addition, a copy of the notice shall be sent by mail to the
property owner at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the
office of the County Treasurer. Written notice shall also be mailed to any
mortgage holder as shown by the records in the office of the County Clerk to
the last known address of the mortgagee. At the time of mailing of notice to
any property owner or mortgage holder, the municipality shall obtain a receipt
of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of
mailing and the name and address of mailee. However, if neither the property
owner nor mortgage holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy
of the notice on the property, or by publication as defined in 11 O.S. § 1-102.
Such notice may be published once not less than ten days prior to any hearing
or action by the municipality pursuant to the provisions of this section.
   (B)   A hearing shall be held by the governing body to determine if the
property is dilapidated and has become detrimental to the health, safety, or
welfare of the general public and the community, or if the property creates a
fire hazard which is dangerous to other property.
   (C)   Pursuant to a finding that the condition of the property constitutes a
detriment or a hazard and that the property would be benefitted by the removal
of such conditions, the governing body may cause the dilapidated building to be
torn down and removed. The governing body shall fix reasonable dates for the
commencement and completion of the work. The Municipal Clerk shall immediately
file a notice of dilapidation and lien with the County Clerk's office
describing the property, the findings of the munici-pality at the hearing, and
stating the municipality claims a lien on the property for the destruction and
removal costs and that such costs are the personal obligation of the property
owner from and after the date of filing of the notice. The agents of the
municipality are granted the right of entry on the property for the performance
of the necessary duties as a governmental function of the municipality if the
work is not performed by the property owner within dates fixed by the governing
body.
   (D)   The governing body shall determine the actual cost of the dismantling
and removal of dilapidated buildings and any other expenses that may be
necessary in conjunction with the dismantling and removal of the buildings,
including the cost of notice and mailing. The Municipal Clerk shall forward a
statement of the actual cost attributable to the dismantling and removal of the
buildings and a demand for payment of such costs, by mail to the property
owner. In addition, a copy of the statement shall be mailed to any mortgage
holder at the address provided for in division (A) of this section. At the time
of mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner or mortgage holder,
the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service,
which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of
the mailee. If the municipality dismantles or removes any dilapidated
buildings, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of
the labor, maintenance and equipment required for the dismantling and removal
of the dilapidated buildings. If dismantling and removal of the dilapidated
buildings is done on a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to
the lowest and best bidder.
   (E)   When payment is made to the municipality for costs incurred, the
Municipal Clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to
actual cost of the dismantling and removal of the buildings is not made within
six months from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner of such
property, the Municipal Clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount
of the cost to the County Treasurer in which the property is located. Once
certified to the County Treasurer, payment may only be made to the County
Treasurer except as otherwise provided in this section. The costs shall be
levied on the property and collected by the County Treasurer as are other taxes
authorized by law. Until finally paid, the cost and the interest thereon shall
be the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date of the
notice of dilapidation and lien is filed with the County Clerk. In addition,
the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien against the property from the
date the notice of the lien is filed with the County Clerk. The lien shall be
coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special
assessments and shall be prior and superior to all other titles and liens
against the property. The lien shall continue until the costs are fully paid.
At the time of collection, the County Treasurer shall collect a fee of $5 for
each parcel of property. The fee shall be deposited to the credit of the
general fund of the county. If the County Treasurer and the municipality agree
that the County Treasurer is unable to collect the assessment, the municipality
may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest
thereon including an action in personam against the property owner and an
action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest,
if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface owner, shall
not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section.
Upon receiving payment, the Municipal Clerk shall forward to the County
Treasurer a notice of such payment and shall direct discharge of the lien.
   (F)   The municipality may designate, by ordinance, an administrative
officer or administrative body to carry out the duties of the governing body
specified in this section. The property owner shall have a right to appeal to
the municipal governing body from any order of the administrative officer or
administrative body. Such appeal shall be taken by filing written notice of
appeal with the Municipal Clerk within ten days after the administrative order
is rendered.
   (G)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DILAPIDATED BUILDING.
      (1)   A structure which through neglect or injury lacks necessary repairs
or otherwise is in a state of decay or partial ruin to such an extent that the
structure is a hazard to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public;
      (2)   A structure which is unfit for human occupancy due to the lack of
necessary repairs and is considered uninhabitable or is a hazard to the health,
safety, and welfare of the general public;
      (3)   A structure which is determined by the municipal governing body or
administrative officer of the municipal governing body to be an unsecured
building, as defined by §
150.121, more than three times within any 12-month period;
      (4)   A structure which has been boarded and secured, as defined by §
150.121, for more than 36 consecutive months; or
      (5)   A structure declared by the municipal governing body to constitute
a public nuisance.
   GOVERNING BODY. The City Council. The City Council designates the City
Manager as the administrative officer to carry out the duties of the governing
body.
   OWNER. The owner of record as shown by the most current tax rolls of the
County Treasurer.
   (H)   Nothing in the provisions of this section shall prevent the
municipality from abating a dilapidated building as a nuisance or otherwise
exercising its police power to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the
general public.
   (I)   The officers, employees or agents of the municipality shall not be
liable for any damages or loss of property due to the removal of dilapidated
buildings performed pursuant to the provisions of this section or as otherwise
prescribed by law.

§ 150.121 SECURING AND BOARDING DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS.
   (A)   After a building has been declared dilapi- dated, as provided in §
150.120, and before the commencement of the tearing and removal of a
dilapidated building, the governing body of the municipality may authorize that
such a building be boarded and secured. However, if the dilapidated building is
vacant and unfit for human occupancy, the governing body may authorize the
structure to be demolished pursuant to §
150.120.
   (B)   The governing body of the municipality may cause the premises on which
an unsecured building is located to be cleared of trash and weeds in accordance
with the provisions of §
96.18 of this code.
   (C)   The governing body of the municipality may cause an unsecured building
to be boarded and secured in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   Before the governing body orders such action, at least ten days'
notice that such unsecured building is to be boarded and secured shall be given
by mail to any property owners and mortgage holders as provided in §
150.120. At the time of mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage
holder, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal
service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and
address of the mailee. A copy of the notice shall also be posted on the
property to be affected. However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage
holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on
the property or by publication as defined in 11 O.S. § 1-102. Such notice shall
be published one time, not less than ten days prior to any hearing or action by
the municipality pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the municipal
governing body anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with
the provisions of subdivision (C)(9), the notice shall state that any
subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six-month
period after the initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant to such
notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the municipal governing body,
[that the cost of the boarding and securing shall be charged] against the
owner, and that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment,
all without further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder;
      (2)   The owner of the property may give his written consent to the
municipality authorizing the boarding and securing of such unsecured building
and to the payment of any costs incurred thereby. By giving written consent,
the owner waives his right to a hearing by the municipal governing body;
      (3)   If the property owner does not give his written consent to such
actions, a hearing may be held by the municipal governing body to determine
whether the boarding and securing of such unsecured building would promote and
benefit the public health, safety or welfare. Such hearing may be held in
conjunction with a hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds
or grass on the premises of such unsecured building held pursuant to the
provisions of §
96.18(C). In making such determination, the governing body shall apply the
following standard: the governing body may order the boarding and securing of
the unsecured building when the boarding and securing thereof would make such
building less available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard
created by such building, or decrease the hazard that such building would
constitute an attractive nuisance to children. Upon making the required
determination, the municipal governing body may order the boarding and securing
of the unsecured building;
      (4)   After the governing body order the boarding and securing of such
unsecured building, the Municipal Clerk shall immediately file a notice of
unsecured building and lien with the County Clerk describing the property,
stating the findings of the municipality at the hearing at which such building
was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the municipality claims a lien
on the property for the costs of boarding and securing such building and that
such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the
date of filing the notice;
      (5)   Pursuant to the order of the governing body, the agents of the
municipality are granted the right of entry on the property for the performance
of the boarding and securing of such building and for the performance of all
necessary duties as a governmental function of the municipality;
      (6)   After an unsecured building has been boarded and secured, the
governing body shall determine the actual costs of such actions and any other
expenses that may be necessary in conjunction therewith including the cost of
the notice and mailing. The Municipal Clerk shall forward a statement of the
actual costs attributed to the boarding and securing of the unsecured building
and a demand for payment of such costs, by mail to any property owners and
mortgage holders as provided in §
150.120. At the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner
or mortgage holder, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the
postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name
and address of the mailee. If the municipality boards and secures any unsecured
building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of
the labor, materials and equipment required for the performance of such
actions. If such actions are done on a private contract basis, the contract
shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder;
      (7)   When payment is made to the municipality for costs incurred, the
Municipal Clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to
the actual costs of the boarding and securing of the unse-cured building is not
made within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner
of such property, the Municipal Clerk shall forward a certified statement of
the amount of the costs to the County Treasurer in which the property is
located. Once certified to the County Treasurer, payment may only be made to
the County Treasurer except as otherwise provided in this section. The costs
shall be levied on the property and collected by the county treasurer as are
other taxes authorized by law. Until fully paid, the costs and the interest
thereon shall be the personal obligation of the property owner from and after
the date the notice of unsecured building and lien is filed with the County
Clerk. In addition, the costs and the interest thereon shall be a lien against
the property from the date the notice of the lien is filed with the County
Clerk. The lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all
other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and superior to all
other titles and liens against the property. The lien shall continue until the
costs and interest are fully paid. If the County Treasurer and the municipality
agree that the County Treasurer is unable to collect the assessment, the
municipality may pursue a civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and
interest thereon, by an action in personam against the property owner and an
action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest,
if severed from the surface owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment
lien created pursuant to this section. Upon receiving payment, the Municipal
Clerk shall forward to the County Treasurer a notice of such payment and shall
direct discharge of the lien;
      (8)   The municipality may designate by ordinance an administrative
officer or administrative body to carry out the duties of the governing body
specified in division (C) of this section. The property owner or mortgage
holder shall have a right to appeal to the municipal governing body from any
order of the administrative officer or administrative body. Such appeal shall
be taken by filing written notice of appeal with the Municipal Clerk within ten
days after the administrative order is rendered;
      (9)   If the municipal governing body causes a structure within the
municipal limits to be boarded and secured, any subsequent need for boarding
and securing within a six-month period constitutes a public nuisance and may be
summarily boarded and secured without further prior notice to the property
owner or mortgage holder. At the time of each such summary boarding and
securing, the municipality shall notify the property owner or mortgage holder
of the boarding and securing and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that
the property owner may request an appeal with the Municipal Clerk within ten
days after the mailing of the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as
provided for in subdivision (1) of this division. Unless otherwise determined
at the hearing, the costs of such boarding and securing shall be determined and
collected as provided for in subdivisions (6) and (7) of this division;
         (10)   The governing body of the municipality may determine that a
building is unsecured and order that such building be boarded and secured in
the manner provided for in this section even though such building has not been
declared, by the governing body, to be dilapidated; and
          (11)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      BOARDING AND SECURING or BOARDED AND SECURED. The closing, boarding or
locking of any or all exterior openings so as to prevent entry into the
structure.
      GOVERNING BODY. The City Council.
      UNFIT FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY. A structure that due to lack of necessary
repairs is considered uninhabitable and is a hazard to the health, safety, and
welfare of the general public.
      UNSECURED BUILDING. Any structure which is not occupied by a legal or
equitable owner thereof, or by a lessee of a legal or equitable owner, and into
which there are one or more unsecured open-ings such as broken windows,
unlocked windows, broken doors, unlocked doors, holes in exterior walls, holes
in the roof, broken basement or cellar hatch-ways, unlocked basement or cellar
hatchways or other similar unsecured openings which would facilitate an
unauthorized entry into the structure.
   (D)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property zoned
and used for agricultural purposes.

§ 151.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(`83 Code, § 12-301) (Ord. 87-10, passed 7-20-87; Am. Ord. 2012-03, passed 2-
20-12)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(`83 Code, § 12-302) (Ord. 87-10, passed 7-20-87; Am. Ord. 2012-03, passed 2-
20-12)
§ 151.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. For the purpose of determining rates, structures for
which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING
CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as “existing structures.”
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on

and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that such
enclo-sure is not built to render the structure in violation of the applicable
non-elevation design requirement of 44 CFR 60.3, the National Flood Insurance
Program regulations.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a

flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, structures for which
the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an
initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes,
NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation
adopted by the City of Claremore City Council and includes and subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement,
or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. PERMANENT CONSTRUCTION does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include
excavation of basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or shed not occupied as dwellings or not
part of the main structure.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid tank,
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE shall be considered cumulative if flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage,”
regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term does not, however,
include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter. For full requirements see 44 CFR 60.6, the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.

§ 151.13 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him and may include but not be
limited to plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions,
and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed
structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of
the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the
following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all new and substantially improved structures;
      (2)   Description of the extent of which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Approval or denial of a development permit by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (4)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (5)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (6)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
      (7)   The expected heights, velocity, dura- tion, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters, and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
      (8)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (9)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for pro-posed use; and
      (10)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator or City Council, as applicable, may
approve certain development in Zones A or AE delineated on the Rogers County
FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than
one foot, provided that the applicant for the development permit in that case
first complies with 44 CFR § 65.12.

§ 151.14 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   The City Council of the City of Claremore may grant variances for
uses which do not satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or this chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents
adequate proof that (i) compliance with this chapter will result in an
arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or
advantage to the people and (ii) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this §
151.14(A). However, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the
variance will be to permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably
creates flooding hazards.
      (2)   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the state.
      (3)   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than 20
years.
      (4)   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the City
Council, accompanied by a filing fee of $25.
      (5)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded
by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
providing the relevant factors in §
151.14(B) and provisions of this §
151.14 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (6)   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Chairman of the City
Council which states that:
         (a)   The cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than
the base flood elevation; and
         (b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
      (7)   At such time as the City Council deems the petition ready for
notification to the public, the City Council shall schedule a hearing and
direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in Rogers County at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
      (8)   The City Council shall conduct the hearing and make determinations
in accordance with the applicable provisions of §
151.14. The City Council shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the
equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to
the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
      (9)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and
         (d)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (10)    Upon consideration of the factors stated in this §
151.14 and the intent of this chapter, the City Council may attach such
conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
purposes and objectives stated in §
151.01 of this chapter.
   (B)   Special provisions.
      (1)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
         (a)   The criteria of §§
151.14(A)(5),
151.14(A)(10),
151.14(B)(2) and
151.14(B)(3) are met; and
         (b)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

§ 151.15 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the
following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial
improvements:
      (1)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
      (2)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      (4)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      (5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood water; and
      (7)   On-site waste water disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(`83 Code, § 12-316)
   (B)   Specific standards.
      (1)   No development shall be allowed in the Floodway (F1) District
except as set forth in §
151.18.
      (2)   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation
data has been provided as set forth in §§
151.05 to
151.12 and
151.15 to
151.18, the following provisions are required:
         (a)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to at least two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this
subsection as proposed in §
151.13 is satisfied;
         (b)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least
two (2) feet above the base flood level. A registered professional engineer,
architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Floodplain
Administrator that the standard of this division (B)(2) is satisfied.
         (c)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or

exit of floodwaters.
         (d)   Manufactured homes. Require that all manufactured homes:
            1.   To be placed within zone A and/or AE on the Rogers FIRM, shall
be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage and have
the bottom of the manufactured home’s subfloor elevated to or above the base
flood elevation. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must
be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
state and local anchoring requirements for resisting windforces. The home shall
be installed by a licensed installer according to Oklahoma state law and
compliance herewith shall be certified in writing to the Floodplain
Administrator by the installer prior to habitation of the manufactured home.
         (e)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed
on sites within zones A and AE on the Rogers County FIRM either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,

            3.   Meet the permit requirements of §
151.13, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes”
in §
151.15(B)(2)(d). A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on
its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
         (f)   Accessory structure. Accessory structures to be placed on sites
within zones A and AE on the Rogers County FIRM shall comply with the
following:
            1.   The structure shall be unfinished on the interior;
            2.   The structure shall be used only for parking and limited

§ 151.18 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in §§
151.05 through
151.11 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a
professional registered engineer or architect is provided demonstrating through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practices that encroachments shall not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge; or
   (B)   If §
151.15(A) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §
151.15(A).
   (C)   The City of Claremore may permit encroachments within the adopted
floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided
that the applicant for the development permit complies with all of 44 CFR §
65.12.

§ 151.19 NEW DEVELOPMENT; WAIVER OF SERVICE AREA RESTRICTION.
   (A)   Irrespective of any other provisions to the contrary herein, from and
after the effective date of this section, there shall be no new development
per-mitted within the 100-year flood plain as defined in the latest publication
of the National Flood Insurance Programs “Flood Insurance Rate Map” for the
city, which would generate wastewater to be transported to the wastewater
treatment facilities of the city.
   (B)   An owner/developer of property situated in the floodplain may make
request, in writing, to the city for a “Waiver of Service Area Restriction”
only in cases where the owner/developer can sufficiently show that the natural
environment in the 100-year floodplain would be preserved if the waiver was
granted. The written request for a “Waiver of Service Area Restriction” must be
submitted to the Floodplain Administrator of the city, who upon review thereof
will judge whether the requested waiver conforms to the intent of this section.
If it be found that the waiver would not be in keeping with the intent of this
section, the request for a “Waiver of Service Area Restriction” shall be
denied. Should the findings of the Floodplain Administrator be that the
requested waiver would not violate the intent of this section, nor have
detrimental effect upon the natural functions and values of the effected
floodplain, when such a request would be presented to the City Council for the
consideration and possible approval. Only after City Council approval, the city
would then submit the request to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
regional administrator for review and possible approval. It is specifically the
intent of this section that the regional administrator be the final authority
in all such request for a “Waiver of Service Area Restriction.”

   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate or other certifications required in this chapter is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of
its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall
upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500 for each violation, and in
addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City Council of the City of Claremore or its City
Attorney from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.
