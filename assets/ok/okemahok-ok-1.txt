   A.   Dangerous Circumstances: Some nuisances are of such nature as to
constitute a grave and immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or
welfare of one (1) or more persons or of the public generally. If such
circumstances actually exist, the City Manager or other appropriate officer or
agency of the City government may take immediate and proper action summarily to
abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate
action can be taken toward such abatement.
   B.   Submission Of Statement Of Nuisance: The Chief of the Fire Department,
the Chief of Police, the City Attorney, the Health Officer, the building
inspector, the electrical inspector, the plumbing inspector, or any other
officer subordinate to the City Manager or any Council member or resident, may
submit, through or with the consent of the City Manager, a statement as to the
existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the City or law, and a
request or recommendation that it be abated. (Ord. 2003-01-08, 8-25-2003)
   C.   Investigation; Notice To Abate: Upon receiving the complaint or
observing the nuisance himself, the City Code enforcement officer will
investigate the alleged nuisance. If he determines that a public nuisance
exists, he will notify the person responsible for the nuisance. Such notice to
the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by
service of a police officer if their names and addresses are known. At the time
of mailing of notice to the property owner, the City shall obtain a receipt of
mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of
mailing and the name and address of the mailee(s). If the names and addresses
are not known, and the public peace, health, safety, morals, welfare would not
be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be
published in a paper of general circulation within the City. Such notice shall
provide not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days, at the
discretion of the City Manager or his designee, in which to abate such nuisance
or to request a hearing as hereinafter set forth. (Ord. 2017-6, 5-22-2017)

direct the owner or other person responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
it within the specified time, the Council shall direct the City Manager to
abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as
authorized by 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 16. The City Clerk shall send a
statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons
responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just under the
circumstances, if the names and addresses are known. Provided, however, that
the minimum costs assessed by the City for such summary abatement shall not be

thereafter. The City Manager shall direct the City Clerk to forward a statement
and demand payment thereof by certified mail with return receipt requested to

Clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to the actual
cost of the boarding and securing of the unsecured building is not made within
thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner of
such property, the City Clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount
of the cost to the Okfuskee County Treasurer. Once certified to the Okfuskee
County Treasurer, payment may only be made to the County Treasurer, except as
otherwise provided for in this section.
         b.   The costs shall be levied on the property and collected by the
County Treasurer as are other taxes authorized by law.

animal. A valid rabies vaccination certificate listing the subject animal as

the vehicle so proceeding.
      2.   A driver who enters a yield intersection without stopping and has or
causes a collision with a pedestrian at a crosswalk or a vehicle in the
intersection shall prima facie be considered not to have yielded as required
herein.
      3.   The provisions of this subsection shall not release the drivers of
other vehicles approaching the intersection at such a distance as not to
constitute immediate hazard from the duty to drive with due care to avoid a
collision.
      4.   The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign, if required for
safety to stop, shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of

6-4-5: TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND:
The display of signal lights, arrows and words shall be deemed to have the
following meanings and requires the appropriate response on the part of
vehicular traffic and pedestrians:
   A.   Green Alone, "Go":
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless an official sign at such
place prohibits such turn, but any vehicle and any pedestrian lawfully within
the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal displays green
shall have the right of way over such vehicular traffic.
      2.   Pedestrian traffic facing a green signal may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless a "walk" signal
indicator is operating.
   B.   Steady Yellow Or Amber Alone, "Caution":
      1.   The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute a
warning that the "red" or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately
thereafter.
      2.   Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near side
crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so near
the limit line when the "caution" signal first flashes that a stop cannot be
made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the
intersection and clear the same before the "red" signal flashes.
   C.   Red Alone, "Stop":
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk and shall remain standing until green or "go" is shown alone. Except
where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns, vehicles in the right
traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may enter the intersection
cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield the right of
way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection, and the turn shall
be made so as not to interfere in any way with traffic proceeding on a green
signal indication on the cross street.
      2.   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the roadway
when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal
indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety.
No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or
"go" is shown alone unless authorized to do so by a pedestrian "walk" signal.
   D.   Steady Red With Green Arrow:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic lane
may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
the arrow, but shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the movement
indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be made only
on the red with green arrow signal.
      2.   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or "go" is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "walk"
signal.
   E.   Green Arrows Alone: Whenever vehicular traffic movements are controlled
by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal indication,
vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by the green
arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are
displayed. (1985 Code § 15-605)
6-4-6: PEDESTRIANS; SIGNAL INDICATORS:
   A.   Special Pedestrian Signals: Special pedestrian control signals
exhibiting the words "walk", "wait" or "don't walk" shall regulate pedestrian
movement as follows:

in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
      2.   Wait Or Don't Walk: No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway
in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
his crossing on the "walk" signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone
while the "wait" signal is showing. (1985 Code § 15-606)
   B.   Pedestrian Activated School Crossing Signals: Whenever a pedestrian
activated school crossing signal is provided, it requires obedience by
vehicular traffic and pedestrians as follows:

flashes, drivers or operators of vehicles may proceed through the intersection
or pass such signal only with caution.
         b.   Pedestrians shall not proceed in conflict with traffic, but may
activate the signal control switch, and shall wait until steady red alone is
shown before entering the roadway or intersection controlled by the signal.
      2.   Steady yellow alone:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
red or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such
vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection or pass the
signal when the red or "stop" signal is exhibited.
         b.   No pedestrian shall enter the roadway or intersection on which
the signal controls vehicular traffic until steady red alone is shown.
      3.   Steady red:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and shall remain standing
until flashing yellow is shown alone.
         b.   Pedestrians may proceed across the road controlled by the signal,
and shall be given the right of way by the drivers of all vehicles.
      4.   Steady red and steady yellow combined:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
flashing yellow signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and that such
vehicular traffic shall remain standing until the flashing yellow is shown
alone.
         b.   Pedestrians are thereby warned that the flashing yellow signal is
about to be shown, and shall not enter the signal controlled roadway or
intersection, or in a direction which conflicts with the movement of vehicular
traffic; but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing shall
proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island, and shall be given the right
of way by the drivers of all vehicles. (1985 Code § 15-608)
6-4-7: FLASHING SIGNALS:
   A.   Whenever a flashing red or yellow signal is illuminated, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject
to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection,
or pass such signal only with caution.

   A.   Intent And Goals: It is the intent of this article to encourage unified
design of housing, commercial, industrial, or institutional areas and
facilities, or combinations thereof, to provide for integrated developments
having harmony of design and variety of function. It is not intended to permit
a greater density or uses different from those set forth in the regulations of
the district in which the development is located, but this article is to
provide for a greater flexibility in the design of buildings, yards, courts,
and circulation than would otherwise be possible through the strict application
of district regulations, and to produce:
      1.   A maximum choice in the types of environment and living units
available to the public;
      2.   Open space and recreation areas;
      3.   A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography, and geologic features, and prevents soil erosion;
      4.   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development;
      5.   An efficient use of lands resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets and thereby lowering housing costs;
      6.   An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding
development; and
      7.   A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other provisions of these zoning regulations.
   B.   Development As Unit:
      1.   This article is designed to provide for small and large scale
developments incorporating a single type or a variety of residential and
related uses which are planned and developed as a unit. Such a development may
consist of individual lots or it may have common building sites.
      2.   Common land must be an essential and major element of the plan which
is related to and affects the long term value of the homes and other
development.
      3.   A planned unit shall be a separate entity with a distinct character
in harmony with surrounding development. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-2E-2: DEVELOPMENT AUTHORIZED, CONDITIONS:
A planned unit development may be authorized; provided, that all of the

permitted in any district except an A-1 general agricultural district; R-
1 rural single-family district; R-2 single-family district; R-3 rural mobile
home residential district; or an R-4 mobile home residential district.
   B.   Design: The proposed planned unit development shall be designed to
provide for the unified development of the area and in accordance with the
spirit and purposes of the district in which the unit is located. The design
may provide for modification of yard, setback, and height requirements, but the
use, density, intensity of use, and coverage requirements for the district, and
the minimum dimensions established for the design of courts shall not be
reduced.
   C.   Minimum Size Of Site: The minimum size of the site upon which a planned
unit development shall be located shall be not less than three (3) acres for
commercial developments, not less than ten (10) acres for residential
developments, and not less than forty (40) acres for industrial, educational,
medical, and other types of institutional developments.
   D.   Off Street Parking: The off street parking requirements set forth in
article D of this chapter may be complied with by providing one or more
permanent, common, off street parking facilities for all uses within the
development; provided, that the facility contains the requisite number of
spaces for each use, and that the spaces provided for permanent residents shall
be clearly designated and separated from spaces provided for employees,
customers, and service. The total spaces provided shall not be less than the
sum of the individual requirements and the spaces required for each use, and
shall be under the ownership or permanent control of the owners of the use for
which the spaces are required.
   E.   Site Development Plan: The developer shall submit a site development
plan of the proposed development in support of the application for a planned
unit development permit. This application shall be considered the same as a
rezoning request and the same procedures shall be followed concerning
application, planning commission review, and public hearings. Upon approval by
the city council, the site development plan shall become a part of the zoning
districts map. The plan may provide for staged development of the project and
shall so indicate on the plan.
   F.   Deviation Or Change In Plan: Any substantial deviation from the plan
submitted at the time of rezoning shall constitute a violation of the rezoning,
and substantial change in plans shall be resubmitted for review following the
same procedure required in the original adoption of the plan. The chief
enforcement officer shall interpret what constitutes a "substantial" deviation
or change in the plan.
   G.   Time Limit For Commencement: The construction of the planned unit
development shall be started within two (2) years of the effective date of
approval of the plan by the city council. Failure to begin the development
within the two (2) years shall automatically void the development plan and the
land shall revert to the same zoning classification which existed immediately
preceding the approval of the planned unit development.
   H.   Homes Association: A homes association shall be created if other
satisfactory arrangements have not been made for improving, operating, and
maintaining common facilities, including streets, drives, service and parking
areas, and recreation areas. When required, the owner(s) shall establish a
homes association in accordance with the requirements and procedures outlined
by FHA in sections 7 and 8.2 of the land planning bulletin no. 6 entitled
"Planned Unit Development With A Homes Association", dated December, 1963.

10-4A-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban
development. The arrangement of land parcels in the community for residential,
commercial and industrial uses and for streets, alleys, schools, parks and
other public purposes will determine to a large degree the conditions of
health, safety, economy and amenity that prevail in the urban area. The quality
of these conditions is of public interest. These subdivision regulations and
standards for the subdivision and improvement of land for urban use are to make
provision for adequate light, air, open space, drainage, transportation, public
utilities and other needs, to ensure the development and maintenance of a
healthy, attractive and efficient community that provides for the conservation
and protection of its human and natural resources.
   B.   These subdivision regulations are designed and intended to achieve the
following and should be administered so as to:
      1.   Assist orderly, efficient and coordinated development within the
territorial jurisdiction;
      2.   Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of
slums and blight;
      3.   Harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land to
the existing community and facilitate the future development of adjoining
tracts;
      4.   Provide that the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the
tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the
tract, and that cost of improvements which primarily benefit the whole
community be borne by the whole community;
      5.   Provide the best possible design for the tract;
      6.   Provide the most beautiful relationship between the uses of land and
buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the city, having particular
regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways, and the
pedestrian traffic movements appropriate to the various uses of land and
buildings, and to provide for the proper location and width of streets and
building lines;
      7.   Prevent pollution of the air, streams and ponds; to assure the
adequacy of drainage facilities; to safeguard the water table; and to encourage
the wide use and management of natural resources throughout the city in order
to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the community and the value
of the land;
      8.   Preserve the natural beauty and topography of the city and to ensure
appropriate development with regard to these natural features;
      9.   Reconcile any differences of interest; and
      10.   Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision. (Ord.
09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-4A-3: AUTHORITY:
These subdivision regulations and minimum standards for land development are
adopted under the authority granted by 11 Oklahoma Statutes sections 45-101
through 45-104. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-4A-4: APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS:
   A.   Forms Of Land Subdivision: These subdivision regulations and
development standards shall apply to the following forms of land subdivision:

easement through any tract of land regardless of the area involved, including
those for use by public and private utility companies; or
      4.   The dedication or vacation of any street or alley through any tract
of land regardless of the area involved.
   B.   Certificate Of Preliminary Plat Approval: No subdivider proposing to
make, or having made, a subdivision within the territorial jurisdiction shall
proceed with any construction work on the proposed subdivision, including
grading, before obtaining a certificate of preliminary plat approval, and shall
not convey title to any lot or lots before obtaining from the planning

      1.   The planning commission shall act upon the final plat within forty
five (45) days after it has been submitted for final approval. This approval
and the date thereof shall be shown on the plat over the signature of the
planning commission chairman or secretary. Unless stipulation for additional
time is agreed to by the subdivider, and if no action is taken by the planning
commission at the end of forty five (45) days after submission, the plat shall
be deemed to have been approved. A certificate by the city clerk as to date of
submission of the plat for final approval, and failure of the planning
commission to act thereon within such time shall be sufficient in lieu of
written endorsement of approval.
      2.   If the final plat is disapproved, grounds for this refusal shall be
stated in writing, a copy of which shall be transmitted with the tracing and
prints to the applicant. The reasons for disapproval shall refer specifically

   F.   City Council Action: Before recording the final plat, it shall be
submitted to the city council for approval and for acceptance of public ways
and service and utility easements and land dedicated to public use. This
approval of the plat shall be shown over the signature of the mayor and
attested to by the city clerk or his deputy. The disapproval of any plat or
plan by the city council shall be deemed a refusal of the proposed dedication
shown thereon.
   G.   Prints Furnished By Applicant: After final approval of the plat and the
affixing of all required signatures on the original tracing, the subdivider
shall provide the planning commission with two (2) dark line prints thereof,
and one contact reproducible cloth tracing, the tracing to be filed with the
city engineer. The applicant, accompanied by a representative of the city,
shall file the original tracing with the county clerk; and the applicant shall
pay all required filing fees.
   H.   Approval And Recording Of Plats Required: No plat or other land
subdivision instrument shall be filed in the office of the county clerk until
it shall have been approved by the planning commission and by the city council
as required. All final plats shall be filed within two (2) years of the date of
approval by the planning commission, and no lots shall be sold from any plat
until recorded. Failure to record the plat within two (2) years of the date of
planning commission or city council approval, whichever is the later, shall
void all approvals thereto. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)

shall be designed in accordance with the following provisions:
   A.   Major Streets: Major streets shall be planned to conform with the major
street and expressway plan.
   B.   Service Streets; Protection Of Residential Properties: Whenever a
subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the
planning commission may require service streets, reverse frontage with screen
planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line,
deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection
of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
   C.   Minor Streets: Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged.
   D.   Railroad Rights Of Way: Where a subdivision borders on or contains a
railroad right of way or limited access highway right of way, the planning
commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right of way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land. Such distances also shall be determined with due regard for
the requirements of approach grades and future grade separation structures.
   E.   Reserve Strips: Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except where their control is placed in the city under conditions
approved by the planning commission.
   F.   Future Street System For Unsubdivided Portion Of Plat: Where the plat
to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for
development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street
system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the
subdivider.
   G.   Large Lots Or Parcels: When a tract is subdivided into larger than
normal building lots or parcels, as defined by section
10-4C-5 of this article, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit
the logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate
resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility easements and connections
for such resubdivision.
   H.   Street Jogs: Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one
hundred fifty feet (150') should be avoided.

Major streets:
 Primary arterial    120 feet
 Secondary arterial  100 feet
Minor streets:
 Collector           60 feet
 Local               50 feet
 
      2.   Whenever the major or minor street is located wholly within the
proposed subdivision, the total width of the right of way shall be dedicated;
and whenever the major or minor street is located adjacent to the outer edge of
the subdivision, one-half (1/2) of the right of way shall be dedicated, if it
is determined by the planning commission that it is equitable and feasible from
an engineering design standpoint for the other half of the right of way to be
dedicated from adjacent property.
   J.   Design Criteria; Surface; Construction: In general, the design criteria
as set forth in table
10-4C-1 of this section shall be followed in the layout and design of major and
minor streets. All collector streets shall have an approved surface not less
than thirty two feet (32') in width, measured from face to face of curbs and
all other minor streets shall have an approved surface of not less than twenty
six feet (26') in width, measured from face to face of curbs. All construction
shall be in accordance with the street construction specifications of the city.
   K.   Intersections: Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles
as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle less than sixty degrees
(60°). Detailed designs of intersections may be required.
   L.   Cul-De-Sacs: A cul-de-sac should not exceed five hundred feet (500') in
length, measured from the entrance to the center of the turnaround, and, if
more than one hundred fifty feet (150') in length, shall be provided with a

line and not less than forty feet (40') at the curbline.
   M.   Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these subdivision regulations; and provided, that the planning
commission finds it will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other
half of the street easement when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever
a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the
street shall be platted within the tract which is being subdivided.
   N.   Arrangement And Names Of Streets:
      1.   The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no hardship in
the subdividing of adjacent properties. The planning commission may require the
dedication of street rights of way to facilitate the development of adjoining
properties.
      2.   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the planning commission.

commercial, industrial or other purposes shall lay out, grade and otherwise
improve all streets that are designated on the approved plat or that directly
serve the subdivision in accordance with the specifications of the city and in
accordance with the following provisions:
   A.   New Street Intersecting State Or Federal Highway: The design of an
improvement of an intersection of any new street with an existing state or
federal highway shall be in accordance with the specifications of the Oklahoma
state highway department, but in no case shall the standard be less than the
applicable city specifications.
   B.   Portion Of Cost Paid By Subdivider: Whenever a subdivision contains a
major street that requires a street facility that is more costly than is
required to serve the future occupants of the subdivision, the subdivider shall
be required to pay only the portion of the cost of the major street that would
equal the cost of an improvement required to serve only the subdivision, as
determined by the city council.
   C.   Driveways: All driveways which connect with public streets shall be
constructed in accordance with "Standard Design Of Driveway Entrances For
Oklahoma Highways", revised September 1956, and subsequent amendments thereto,
as prepared by the Oklahoma state highway department. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-

10-4D-8: WATER LINES AND FIRE HYDRANTS:
   A.   Installation Of Lines And Hydrants:
      1.   The subdivider shall install water lines and fire hydrants when an
existing city water line is located within a reasonable distance as determined
by the planning commission.
      2.   Installation shall be in accordance with the specifications
governing water line construction, as provided for herein.
      3.   Work included under these specifications shall include the
furnishing and installation of all pipes, valves, fittings, specials, fire
hydrants and other incidental work and materials in connection with conveying
water from the source of supply to the water mains and to each fire hydrant,
including furnishing and installation of all the water mains and appurtenances
in accordance with the plans and these specifications. All work shall be
performed in accordance with these subdivision regulations and with
recommendations and regulations of the state health department.
   B.   Excavations And Trenches:
      1.   Trenching Generally:
         a.   The location of the water mains, hydrants, valves, etc., shall be
shown on the city maps or plans. Trenches shall be of sufficient width to
provide ample room for workmen and making joints. In no case shall the trench
inside of sheeting and bracing lines be less than twelve inches (12") greater
than the external diameter of the pipe bell. Trenches shall be cut to depths
which shall provide a minimum cover of thirty inches (30"). The cover shall be
measured from the top of the barrel of the pipe to the finished surface of the
ground or street. The grade of the invert of all water lines shall, in general,
be parallel to the street grade, except that the engineer may require a greater
depth, not to exceed two feet (2'), at the point where there is a sharp break
in the street grade, or where necessary to provide clearance for existing or
proposed pipelines of drainage structures. Bottoms of the trenches shall be
accurately graded to provide uniform bearing and support for the pipe.
         b.   Ledge rock, boulders and large stones shall be removed to provide
a clearance of at least six inches (6") on each side of all pipes and
appurtenances. Adequate clearance for properly jointing pipe laid in rock
trenches shall be provided at bell holes.
      2.   Protection Of Excavation: The contractor shall adequately protect
all excavations from caving in by providing suitable sheeting, shoring and
bracing.
      3.   Backfilling Trenches:
         a.   After water mains have been tested and approved, the trenches
shall be backfilled.
         b.   Where water mains are laid in rock, shale or clay, four (4) to
six inches (6") of sand shall be placed in the trench between bell holes to
provide a uniform and continuous bearing and support for the pipe. When the
water main is in place and the joint has been completed, the trench shall be
backfilled with sand to the top of the pipe. Where mains are constructed in the
parking area or parallel to a road where there would normally be no traffic,
the remainder of the trench may be filled with a Morman board or other such
device, allowing six inches (6") for top dressing, after which the entire
trench shall be settled with water. After settlement, the top dressing shall be
applied, but in no case shall the top dressing be applied where pools of water
are standing. Where the trench is excavated in front of developed property, the
top dressing must be, in general, of as good soil as the original ground, and
in the event there is a lawn, trees or decorative shrubbery, the growth shall
be protected and restored to its original condition.
         c.   Where the water main crosses roadways or rights of way, etc.:
            (1)   Where the water main crosses any unpaved roadway, gravel or
oil surfaced road, driveway of any kind, or railroad tracks, four (4) to six
inches (6") of sand shall be placed in the trench below the grade of the pipe
invert. After the pipe is laid to grade, sand shall be used for backfill to the
top of the pipe, the sand to be flooded with water to prevent settlement. Then
the backfill from the top of the sand to the top of the trench shall be
compacted in six inch (6") layers to a density of at least equal to that of the
top six (6) to twelve inches (12") of the surrounding earth, using water if
required to get proper compaction.
            (2)   In case the excavation fails to furnish suitable material for
the bottom of the trench or backfill, the contractor shall supply such material
as will be suitable and satisfactory to the engineer, moving same from another
locality or part of work as necessary.
            (3)   Where the water mains are constructed under proposed paving
or paving which has been cut in or across roads and highways, driveways,
sidewalks, under fences, foundations or other such structures, four (4) to six
inches (6") of sand shall be placed in the trench below the grade of the pipe
invert, and after the pipe is laid to grade, the entire trench shall be
backfilled with sand from the bottom to the top of the trench, and then
thoroughly settled with water by flooding or jetting, being certain that the
sand around and under the pipe is sufficiently wetted to attain maximum
compaction.
   C.   Cutting And Replacing Paving:
      1.   Where concrete, asphalt concrete or asphalt concrete base paving has
been cut, the contractor shall dispose of the broken materials, and after the
sand backfill has been completed, shall apply a temporary patch of asphalt
surface course (hot mixed cold laid). The contractor shall maintain these
patches for a period of sixty (60) days or to the time the permanent repair has
been made. A permit fee and repair fee shall be paid to the city before any
paving cut is made, and evidence of payment of these fees shall be shown to the
city inspector for the job on which the cut or cuts occur. Street cuts will not
be allowed for the purpose of laying water lines where boring is feasible, as
determined by the city council.
      2.   Where water mains are to be installed across an existing paved
street by boring, a sleeve jacket of next larger size in diameter of PVC pipe
will be installed in the bore hole to protect the main line.
   D.   Pipe And Fittings: All pipe and fittings used for the construction of
the water mains and distribution system shall conform to the following
requirements:
      1.   All water lines will be of a quality equal to or better than that
for PVCSDR 21 pipe as determined by the American Water Works Association
(AWWA).
      2.   All pipes shall be straight, accurately circular in section, with
all inner and outer surfaces concentric. Except where shorter lengths are
required for connections with valves, fittings or changes in design
requirements where such connections must be made at specific locations, all
pipe shall be furnished in laying lengths of not less than twenty feet (20')
plus or minus two inches (±2"), and the length or lengths to be furnished shall
be stipulated in the proposal.
      3.   All pipes shall be delivered in all respects sound and conformable
to these specifications. Inspection by the city or its representative shall not
relieve the contractor of any of his obligations in this respect, and any
defective pipe which may be passed by the city or its representative, at the
works or elsewhere, shall be at all times liable to rejection when discovered
until the final completion and adjustment of the contract. Care shall be taken
in handling the pipe not to injure the coating or lining, and pipe damaged
during transportation or at any time after it has received the coating or
lining shall not be used.
   E.   Hydrant Specifications:
      1.   All fire hydrants shall have a six inch (6") mechanical connection
and shall have two (2) 21/2-inch and one 41/2-inch streamer connection designed
for one hundred fifty (150) pounds' working pressure or three hundred (300)
pounds' hydrostatic pressure, and shall conform to the latest specifications of
the American Water Works Association for a traffic model hydrant with breakable
coupling at ground level, with a five and one-fourth inch (51/4") valve
opening. All working parts shall be bronze. All hose threads shall conform to
the standard threads of the city. Design, materials and workmanship shall be
similar and equal to the latest stock pattern ordinarily produced by the
manufacturer.
      2.   All fire hydrants will have a maximum separation not to exceed five
hundred feet (500'), and will be located in order to provide the greatest and
most effective firefighting capacity for the area.
   F.   Setting Hydrants And Valves: Hydrants and valves installed in trenches
shall be placed where shown on the drawings unless otherwise directed by the
engineer. Hydrants, valves and valve boxes shall all be plumb, with valve boxes
placed directly over the valves. After being correctly positioned, earth fill
shall be carefully tamped around the valve box for a distance of four feet (4')
on all sides of the box. Hydrants shall be set at such elevations that the
connection pipe and distributing mains shall have the same depth of cover. Each
hydrant shall be placed upon a slab of stone or concrete not less than four
inches (4") thick and fifteen inches (15") square. The back side of the
hydrant, opposite the pipe connections, shall be firmly wedged between the
hydrant and the vertical face of the trench to prevent the hydrant from flowing
off the line. Around the base of each hydrant shall be placed not less than
seven (7) cubic feet of three-fourths inch (3/4") crushed rock to ensure the
complete drainage of the hydrant when closed. All backfill around hydrants
shall be thoroughly compacted to the surface of the ground. Before installing
any hydrant or valve, care shall be taken to see that all foreign material is
removed from the interior of the barrel. Stuffing boxes shall be tightened and
the hydrant or valve opened or closed to see that all parts are in working
condition.
   G.   Bracing Pipe Bends: All fittings at bends in the pipe shall be firmly
braced by means of a concrete brace block. Additional blocks may be ordered by
the engineer.
   H.   Tests: After the pipe has been laid and jointed, and before any joints
are covered, the pipeline shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of one
hundred fifty (150) pounds per square inch for a period of two (2) hours. If
there is any perceptible leakage during the test, the necessary repairs shall
be made and the test repeated. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-4D-9: INSTALLATION AND STERILIZATION OF MAINS:
   A.   Size Of Lines: Distribution lines shall not be less than six inch (6")
nominal diameter.
   B.   Use Of New Materials: All pipe and accessories, unless otherwise
specifically stipulated in the proposal, shall be new materials which have at
no time previously been used for any purpose whatsoever.
   C.   Cleaning Interior Of Pipes: The interior of all pipe shall be
thoroughly cleaned of all foreign matter before being lowered into the trench
and shall be kept clean during laying operations by means of plugs or other
approved methods. No trench water shall be allowed to enter the pipe or
fittings. At all times when work is not in progress, all open ends of pipes and
fittings shall be securely closed to the satisfaction of the engineer.
   D.   Inspection Of Pipes For Defects: Before lowering, and while suspended,
the pipe shall be inspected for defects. Any defective, damaged or unsound pipe
shall be rejected.
   E.   Pipeline Deflections From Straight Line Or Grade: Pipelines or runs
intended to be straight shall be so laid. Deflections from a straight line or
grade, made necessary by vertical curves or horizontal curves of offsets, shall
not exceed six (6) D inches per linear foot of pipe (where D represents the
nominal internal diameter of the pipe expressed in inches) between the
centerlines, extended, of any two (2) connecting pipes. If the specified or
required alignment requires deflections in excess of those stipulated above,
the contractor shall either provide, at his own expense, special bends as
approved by the engineer, or pipes in shorter length in such length and number
that the angular deflection at any joint, as represented by the specified
maximum deflections, is not exceeded.
   F.   Jute Packing Of Joints: After placing a length of pipe in the trench,
the jute packing material for the joint shall be held around the bottom of the
spigot so that it will enter as the pipe is pushed into position. The spigot
shall be centered in the bell, the pipe pushed into position and brought into
true and specified alignment. Except where necessary in making connections with
other lines and as authorized by the city engineer, pipe shall be laid with the
bells facing in the direction of laying, and for lines on an appreciable slope,
bells shall, at the discretion of the city engineer, face upgrade. Not less
than two (2) lengths of pipe shall be in a position, with jute packing
installed and earth fill tamped alongside the pipe, ahead of each joint before
it is poured, except where necessary for closures. Under no circumstances will
pipe be laid in water, and no pipe shall be laid when trench conditions or the
weather is unsuitable for such work, except by permission of the city engineer.
   G.   Causes For Suspension Of Work: The work, or any portion of the work,
under construction shall be suspended immediately on written order of the city
engineer or the city council for any good cause or causes, among others of
which special reference is made to the following:
      1.   Failure of the contractor to provide sufficient and proper equipment
and properly executing the work;
      2.   Deliberate failure on the part of the contractor to observe any
requirements of these specifications or to comply with any orders given by the
city engineer as provided for in these specifications; or
      3.   Failure of the contractor promptly to make good any defects in
materials or workmanship or any defects of any other nature, the correction of
which has been directed in writing by the city engineer.
   H.   Sterilization Of Mains: Upon completion of the water lines, arrangement
shall be made for their sterilization in a manner satisfactory to the city. At
a minimum, the contractor shall provide the material and do the work necessary
to sterilize all the pipes, valves, hydrants and other surfaces with which
water provided by the system will come in contact, in the following manner:
A solution containing not less than fifty (50) parts per million of chlorine
shall be prepared by the addition of either liquid chlorine or dry calcium
hypochlorite to water introduced into all parts of the system. This solution
shall remain in the parts for at least five (5) hours, and the sterilization
shall be done before any part of the system is put in operation. The contractor
shall have laboratory tests made and shall resterilize lines as necessary
before they are placed in service. Payment for this item shall be included in
the price bid for the construction of the items to be sterilized. (Ord. 09-01-
2000, 10-2-2000)
10-4D-10: SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:
   A.   Sanitary Sewer Or Septic Tank Installation:
      1.   The subdivider shall install sanitary sewers whenever a sanitary
sewer is reasonably accessible as determined by the planning commission.
Sanitary sewers shall be installed in accordance with the specifications
governing sanitary sewer construction, as specified in this section.
      2.   Whenever a sanitary sewer is not reasonably accessible, septic tanks
or other unit disposal systems may be used in accordance with the following
provisions:
         a.   A lot on which a unit disposal system is located shall not be
less than forty three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet in area;
         b.   No portion of any unit disposal system shall be located closer
than twenty feet (20') to the lot line of the lot on which the system is
located; and
         c.   All unit disposal systems shall comply with the recommendations
and requirements of the state and county health departments.
      3.   When subdivisions contain ten (10) acres or more, the planning
commission may require the subdivider to install sanitary sewers and a disposal
system that is adequate to serve all of the lots within the subdivision and as
set forth in the Oklahoma department of health's engineering bulletin number
600 entitled "Septic Tank And Sub Surface Tile Systems" and subsequent
amendments thereto.
      4.   The work under this subsection includes the furnishing of all
material, equipment, tools, labor and supervision necessary to the construction
of sanitary sewers complete, together with all necessary trenching, excavating,
sheeting and bracing, pumping, bailing, pipe laying and backfilling, and the
furnishing of all the materials and appurtenances necessary to the proper
functioning of the complete sewer system.
   B.   Pipe Specifications: All sewer lines shall have a nominal diameter of
eight inches (8") or greater and shall meet or surpass the specifications for
schedule 40 plastic PVC pipe.
   C.   Trench Excavation:
      1.   Excavations of every description and of whatever substance
encountered shall be made to the depth shown on the drawings.
      2.   All excavated material not required for backfilling or not suitable
for use as backfilling material shall be disposed of within the site areas as
directed by the engineer.
      3.   In general, excavation shall be made in open cut to the line and
grade shown on the drawings. Sides of trenches shall be kept as nearly vertical
as possible and shall be sheeted and braced as required.
      4.   The trench width shall be such as to provide ample working space at
the sides of the pipe but in no case shall it exceed the diameter of the barrel
of the pipe plus sixteen inches (16"). The trench width shall be measured at
the top of the pipe. Where cuts exceed ten feet (10'), the trench width shall
be limited to the outside diameter of the pipe plus six inches (6") at the top
of the pipe.
      5.   Wherever wet, unstable soil is encountered, the engineer may, if he
deems it necessary, order the trench bottom to be excavated below grade and the
material so excavated to be replaced with sand, gravel or other suitable
material, well tamped in place. Where, through error or neglect, the contractor
shall carry the excavation below trench grade, he shall backfill to trench
grade with sand, gravel or other suitable material well tamped in place, and
the cost of such backfill shall be borne by the contractor.
      6.   Bell holes shall be cut in the bottom of the trench of sufficient
size to allow for proper jointing of the pipe, but in no case shall they leave
more than one-third (1/3) of the pipe unsupported.
      7.   Excavated material which is to be used in backfilling shall be
neatly piled along the trench in such a manner as to provide a minimum of
inconvenience to other contractors and the traveling public. In no case shall
waterways be obstructed without other provisions being made for the removal of
water.
      8.   When utilities such as water mains, sewers, pipelines, gas mains and
electric conduits are encountered in the excavation, the contractor shall
notify the owner of such utility and shall take such steps as the owner and the
engineer deem necessary to protect such utility from damage. Should damage
occur, the contractor shall repair same at his own expense and shall pay the
owner for any loss suffered on account of such damage.
   D.   Pipe Laying:
      1.   In general, the bottom of the trench shall be so shaped as to
support the pipe throughout its lower quarter. If the trench is in rock or
other hard material, it shall be excavated at least four inches (4") below pipe
grade, and the material so excavated shall be replaced with well tamped sand,
gravel or other suitable material.
      2.   If the foundation is of such material, or if conditions are such
that the pipe cannot be properly supported, or if the load is such that the
engineer deems extra support necessary, he may order in writing that a concrete
cradle or concrete encasement be provided. Extra compensation will be paid for
concrete cradling.
      3.   All pipes shall be inspected for defects before they are lowered
into the trench and shall be carefully cleaned of any dirt or grease, either in
the barrel or on the jointing surfaces. Pipe shall be laid with the bells
upgrade, and pipe laying shall progress upgrade.
      4.   Care shall be taken to lay each pipe to exact line and grade, and to
have the spigot end of each pipe concentric with the bell of the pipe into
which it is laid. Any defective pipe, or any pipe which has its joints
disturbed after laying, shall be taken up and replaced. All branches or other
openings along the line of the pipe shall be securely closed against dirt or
other debris, and at the suspension of work at any time, a suitable stopper
shall be placed at the end of the pipe to prevent the entrance of earth or
debris into the pipe. All Y branches shall be encased in concrete.
      5.   The work or any portion of the work under construction shall be
suspended immediately on written order of the city engineer or the city council
for any good cause or causes, among others of which special reference is made
to the following:
         a.   Failure of the contractor to provide sufficient and proper
equipment for properly executing the work;
         b.   Deliberate failure on the part of the contractor to observe any
requirements of these specifications or to comply with any orders given by the
city engineer, as provided for in these specifications; and
         c.   Failure of the contractor promptly to make good any defects in
materials or workmanship or any defect of any other nature, the correction of
which has been directed in writing by the city engineer.
      6.   All developers who are constructing sewer mains with sewer service
wyes must tie a one inch (1") wide plastic tape to the wye and bring the tape
to the surface of the ground before backfilling the sewer main.
   E.   Backfilling: In general, backfilling shall be done with the material
excavated from the trench. However, should the excavated material contain large
pieces of rock or other material which, in the opinion of the engineer, might
injure the sewer, he may reject it as backfill material or restrict its use to
the upper part of the fill. Selected topsoil, free of weeds, brush, roots and
other deleterious matter shall be used as backfill for embedment of sewer pipe
from the bottom of the trench to a depth of six inches (6") above the top of
the bell. Special care shall be used in placing and thoroughly compacting this
selected topsoil to provide good bearing for the pipe. Backfilling shall be
carried on in the following manner:
      1.   Where sewer lines are laid in rock, shale or clay, four (4) to six
inches (6") of sand shall be placed in the trench between bell holes to provide
a uniform and continuous bearing and support for the pipe. When the pipe is in
place and the joint has been completed, the trench shall be backfilled with
sand to the top of the pipe. Where mains are constructed in the parking or
parallel to a road where there should normally be no traffic, the remainder of
the trench may be filled with a Morman board or other such device, allowing six
inches (6") for top dressing, after which the entire trench shall be settled
with water. After settlement, the top dressing shall be applied, but in no case
shall the top dressing be applied where pools of water are standing. Where the
trench is excavated in front of developed property, the top dressing must be,
in general, of as good soil as the original ground, and in the event there is a
lawn, trees or decorative shrubbery, the growth shall be protected and restored
to its original condition.
      2.   Where the sewer main crosses any unpaved roadway, gravel or oil
surfaced roads, driveways of any kind or railroad tracks, four (4) to six
inches (6") of sand shall be placed in the trench below the grade of the pipe
invert. After the pipe is laid to grade, sand shall be used for backfill to the
top of the pipe, sand to be flooded with water to prevent settlement. Then the
backfill from the top of the sand to the top of the trench shall be compacted
in six inch (6") layers to a density at least equal to that of the top six (6)
to twelve inches (12") of the surrounding earth, using water if required, to
get proper compaction. In case the excavation fails to furnish suitable
material for the bottom of the trench or backfill, the contractor shall supply
such material as will be suitable and satisfactory to the engineer, moving same
from another locality or part of work if necessary. Where compaction is
required or ordered, it shall be compacted to a density equal to that of the
adjacent soil. Where sewer mains are constructed under driveways, sidewalks,
under fences, foundations or other such structures, four (4) to six inches (6")
of sand shall be placed in the trench below the grade of the pipe invert, and
after the pipe is laid to grade, the entire trench shall be backfilled with
sand from the bottom to the top of the trench, and then thoroughly settled with
water by flooding or jetting, being certain that the sand around and under the
pipe is sufficiently wetted to attain maximum compaction.
   F.   Manholes: Manholes shall be constructed where shown on the city maps or
plans. They shall be built of vitrified brick or other suitable material as
approved by the city council and shall be in accordance with the dimensions
shown on the detailed drawings:
      1.   Vitrified brick for the manholes shall be grade A, common, sound and
hardturned, and shall meet the requirements of the ASTM standard specifications
C-62-30 with subsequent revisions.
      2.   Mortar for brickwork shall be composed of one part cement and two
(2) parts sand, to which not more than ten (10) pounds of hydrated lime per
sack of cement may be added.
      3.   Brick manhole walls shall be eight inches (8") thick if not over
eighteen feet (18') deep, and shall be thirteen inches (13") thick for depths
of over eighteen feet (18'). The eight inch (8") walls shall be laid with all
headers, and the thirteen inch (13") walls shall be laid with headers and
stretchers alternately on the inside and the outside of the wall. All joint
spacers must be completely filled with mortar and the outside of the manhole
plastered with one-half inch (1/2") of mortar.
      4.   The invert of the manhole shall be built of split sewer pipe on
straight lines. The curves and the bench above the centerline of the pipe may
be formed in concrete or built up brick and plastered with one-half inch (1/2")
of cement mortar.
      5.   Manhole frames and covers as shown on the detailed drawings shall be
provided for each manhole. The frame shall be thoroughly grouted to the top of
the brick or at such an elevation that the manhole cover will be flush with the
finished grade. The castings shall conform to the standard specifications of
the ASTM for gray iron castings, serial designation A48-18, with subsequent
revisions, and shall be free from pouring faults, cracks, sponginess, blowholes
and other defects that would impair their value for the service intended.
Covers shall sit in their frames without rocking or rattling, and the engineer
shall reject any frames and covers which, in his opinion, will be noisy under
traffic.
      6.   Manholes will be located at distances not to exceed four hundred
feet (400'), and where a bend in the sewer line of more than sixty degrees
(60°) from the normal occurs, a manhole will be constructed.
      7.   Manhole steps shall be of cast iron of high grade and shall provide
a step at least four inches (4") by eight inches (8") from the face of the
manhole, steps to have a sixteen inch (16") spacing. Smaller steps may be used
if a staggered spacing is used. They shall be resistant to rust and corrosion
and free from burrs, pins, sharp edges and excessive roughness. The engineer
shall reject any steps which, in his opinion, would cut or scratch the hands of
the person using them. After being set, they shall be given one coat of an
approved protective asphalt paint.
      8.   Any time a line enters into a manhole over two feet (2') above the
flow line of the manhole, the manhole shall be made into a drop manhole.
   G.   Connections To Existing Sewers And Appurtenances: All connections
between new and existing sewers or appurtenances shall be made in accordance
with the detailed drawings or as directed by the engineer, and the cost of such
connections shall be included in the price bid for sewers complete. The
contractor shall use every precaution to keep earth and other foreign matter
out of the existing sewer or appurtenances and shall, if so ordered by the
engineer, clean the sewer or appurtenances in the immediate vicinity of the
connection. If for any reason it becomes necessary for the contractor to
obstruct the existing sewer, he shall, at his own expense, provide a method
suitable to the engineer of diverting the sewage. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-4D-11: STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE CHANNELS:
   A.   Major Drainage Channels: All major drainage channels lying within or
immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall meet the following conditions:
      1.   All land having an elevation below the 100-year maximum flood
elevation and not protected by levees or dikes shall be dedicated to the city
for the purpose of providing drainage and for public park and utility easement
use.
      2.   The existing channel lying within or immediately adjacent to the
subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the
channel shall be straightened, widened and improved to the extent required to
prevent overflow beyond the limits of the dedicated drainage area.
      3.   Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building sites
and streets to an elevation where all lots, building areas and streets will not
be subject to overflow, and in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff
of all rainfall.
      4.   Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, back sloping,
cribbing and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to control
erosion for all the anticipated conditions of flow for the segment of channel
involved.
      5.   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless
it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer.
      6.   Culverts, bridges and other drainage structures shall be constructed
in accordance with the specifications of the city at all locations where
drainage channels intersect with continuous streets or alleys.
   B.   Drainage Improvement Requirements: Bridges and culverts have the
following requirements:

through culverts or bridges;
      2.   Bridges and culverts shall be sized to accommodate a 50-year
frequency rain based on the drainage area involved; and
      3.   Design of bridges and culverts shall conform to construction
specifications of the city.
   C.   Channels And Storm Sewers Outside Subdivision Boundaries:
      1.   The city reserves the right to require improvements, provision of
drainage easements and provision of agreements beyond the boundaries of the
subdivision to facilitate flow of water through the subdivision, to avoid
probability of lawsuits based on damage from changed runoff in the subdivision,
and also to provide continuous improvement of the overall storm sewer system.
      2.   Requirements outside the subdivision may be:
         a.   Location: In channels or storm sewers flowing to or from the
subdivision, or in channels or storm sewers located in adjacent areas that are
affected by flow of water to the subdivision.
         b.   Improvements:

herein or a street or other element is to be dedicated, the action of the
planning commission shall be forwarded to the city council for its approval and
acceptance of dedications. For all other types of lot splits, the action of the
planning commission shall be final. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-4E-4: VARIATIONS:
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in these subdivision regulations
would result in substantial hardship or inequity, the planning commission may
vary or modify, except as otherwise indicated, such requirements of design, but
not of procedure or improvements, so that the subdivider may develop his
property in a reasonable manner, but so that, at the same time, the public
welfare and interests of the city are protected and the general intent and
spirit of these subdivision regulations preserved. Such modification may be
granted upon written request of the subdivider stating the reason for each
modification and may be waived by three-fourths (3/4) vote of the regular
membership of the planning commission, subject to the acceptance of the plat
and the dedications thereon by the city council. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)

10-5-1: FINDINGS OF FACT; APPLICATION OF CHAPTER:
   A.   Findings:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   B.   Application Of Chapter: This chapter shall apply to all areas of
special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-
2-2000)
10-5-2: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-3: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
   B.   Liberally construed in favor of the city council; and
   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; or
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-5: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application. The following terms as used
herein will mean:
APPEAL: A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation
of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A. A nonbasement building:
      1.   Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH,
B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a
building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piles), or shear walls parallel to the floor of
the water; and
      2.   Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of
the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood.
   B.   In the case of zones A1-30, A1, A, A99, AO AH, B, C, X, D, "elevated
building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated
building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of
"elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by means of
breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5)
of the national flood insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date hereof.
"Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map of a community on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the city.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HABITABLE FLOOR: Any floor usable for the following purposes, which includes:
working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A
floor used for storage purposes only is not a "habitable floor".
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built to render the structure in violation of the applicable
nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national flood insurance
program regulations.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which the
base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
MOBILE HOME OR DOUBLE WIDE MOBILE HOME: A manufactured single- family dwelling
not less than forty feet (40') in length nor less than ten feet (10') in width,
designed for transportation on streets or highways on its own wheels (a
permanent chassis) to a location, ready to be occupied as living quarters.
MODULAR HOME OR MANUFACTURED HOME: A newly constructed home which has been
moved from its manufacturing site by conventional methods or on a truck and has
no permanent chassis. This home is then fully assembled and permanently joined
to a foundation on the city site to be occupied as living quarters.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement,
or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or
walkways; nor does it include excavation of basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: A. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
      1.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
      2.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
   B.   For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of national flood insurance program regulations
is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, herein specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-6: FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   Designation: The city floodplain administrator is appointed to
administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate
sections of 44 CFR (national flood insurance program regulations) pertaining to
floodplain management.

      2.   Review permit application to determine whether proposed building
site will be reasonably safe from flooding;
      3.   Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this chapter;
      4.   Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required;
      5.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation;
      6.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency which is the Oklahoma water resources board prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the federal emergency management agency;
      7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained;
      8.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with section
10-5-7 of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
sections
10-5-13,
10-5-14 and
10-5-15 of this chapter; and
      9.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. (Ord. 09-
01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-7: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency
management agency on its flood insurance study for the city, with accompanying
flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM), and
any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this chapter. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-8: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Required: A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance
with the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Permit Procedures:
      1.   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him and may include, but not be
limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions,
and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed
structures, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special
flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required:
         a.   Elevations in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all new and substantially improved structures;
         b.   Elevations in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;
         c.   A certificate from a registered professional engineer or
architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the
floodproofing criteria of subsection 10-5-14B of this chapter;
         d.   Description of the extent of which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and
         e.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
subsection 10-5-6B1 of this chapter.
      2.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         c.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         d.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         e.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         f.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         h.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         i.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for proposed use; and
         j.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-9: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-10: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-11: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 09-01-
2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-12: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   Judgment On Requests For Variances: The planning and zoning commission
of the city shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Error In Requirements: The appeal board shall hear and render judgment
on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement,
decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   C.   Appeal Of Decision In Court: Any person or persons aggrieved by the
decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of
competent jurisdiction.
   D.   Record Of Actions: The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record
of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal
emergency management agency upon request.
   E.   Historic Places: Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   F.   Lot Size Consideration: Variances may be issued for new construction
and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided the relevant factors in
subsection 10-5-8B2 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
   G.   Attaching Conditions To Granting Of Variances: Upon consideration of
the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purpose and objectives of this chapter as set out in section
10-5-2 of this chapter.
   H.   Increase In Flood Levels: Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   I.   Prerequisites For Granting Variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
      3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the costs of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   J.   Variances For Functionally Dependent Use: Variances may be issued by a
community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other
development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use;
provided, that:
      1.   The criteria outline in subsections A through I of this section are
met; and
      2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to
public safety. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-13: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required for
all new construction and substantial improvements:
   A.   Anchoring: All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
   B.   Minimize Flood Damage: All new construction or substantial improvements
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
   C.   Construction Materials: All new construction or substantial
improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.

improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
   E.   Infiltration Of Floodwaters: All new and replacement water supply
systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the system.
   F.   Sewage Systems: New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system
and discharge from the systems into floodwater.
   G.   Wastewater Disposal: On site wastewater disposal systems shall be
located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-14: SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section
10-5-7, subsection 10-5-6B8 or 10-5-15C of this chapter, the following
provisions are required:
   A.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in
subsection 10-5-8B1 of this chapter is satisfied.
   B.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   C.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to the flooding, shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
      1.   Number, Size Of Openings: A minimum of two (2) openings having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
      2.   Height Of Openings: The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above grade.
      3.   Covers Or Devices: Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,

entry and exit of floodwaters.
      4.   Mobile Homes:
         a.   All mobile homes to be placed within zone A shall be installed
using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this
requirement, mobile homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
         b.   All mobile homes shall be in compliance with subsection C1 of
this section.
         c.   All mobile homes to be placed or substantially improved within
zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor of the mobile home is at or above the
base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system in accordance with the provision of this subsection C4. (Ord.
09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-15: SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:

eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 09-01-2000, 10-2-2000)
10-5-16: AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
10-5-7 of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
   A.   Lowest Floor Elevation: All new construction and substantial
improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the
depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no
depth number is specified).
   B.   Nonresidential Structures: All new construction and substantial
improvements of nonresidential structures shall have the following:
      1.   The lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest
