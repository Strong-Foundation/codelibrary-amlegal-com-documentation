§ 1-10-1 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF COURT.
   This chapter shall govern the organization and operation of the municipal
court of the town, as put into operation by resolution duly passed and filed in
accordance with law, as authorized by state statutes. To the extent of conflict
between any provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any other
ordinance of the town, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
(1998 Code § 6-102; 2013 Code)
§ 1-10-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section:
   CHIEF OF POLICE. The peace officer in charge of the police force of the
town.
   CLERK. The court clerk as appointed by the town, including any deputy or
member of the office staff of the clerk-treasurer while performing duties of
the clerk’s office.
   COURT. The municipal court of this town.
   JUDGE. The judge of the municipal court, including any acting judge or
alternate judge thereof as provided for by the statutes of this state and this
chapter.
   THIS JUDICIAL DISTRICT. The district court judicial district of the state
wherein the government of this town is situated.
(1998 Code § 6-101; 2013 Code)
Statutory reference:
   Similar provisions, see 11 O.S. §§ 27-101 et seq.
§ 1-10-3 JURISDICTION.
   (A)   Generally: The court shall exercise original jurisdiction to hear and
determine all prosecutions wherein a violation of any ordinance of the town is
charged, including any such prosecutions transferred to the court in accordance
with applicable law.
   (B)   Cherokee Nation Agreement With The Town:
      (1)   Background: In McGirt v. Oklahoma, 140 S. Ct. 2452, 2456, 207 L.
Ed. 2d 985 (2020), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Muscogee
Creek Nation Reservation had been established, and had never been
disestablished by Congress. All land, including fee land, within the boundaries
of a reservation is defined as Indian country under 18 U.S.C. § 1151(a) both
the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1153, and the general crimes. As a result,
neither the State of Oklahoma nor its municipalities have jurisdiction over
crimes involving Indian defendants and/or victims occurring in Indian country.
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1152, apply to certain crimes committed by Indians within
Indian country. Following the McGirt decision, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal
Appeals in Hogner v. State, 2021 OK CR 4, 500 P. 3d. 629 (2021), expanded this
holding to the Cherokee Nation Reservation. The Cherokee Nation Reservation
(“Reservation”) was likewise established by treaty, and has never been
disestablished by Congress. Because it has never been expressly disestablished,
it remains intact and is properly defined as Indian country under 18 U.S.C. §
1151(a). Therefore, the State of Oklahoma, and the municipalities therein do
not have jurisdiction over crimes occurring on the Cherokee Reservation
involving Indian defendants and/or victims. Instead, Indian perpetrators who
offend within the town are subject to the Cherokee Nation’s criminal laws and
the jurisdiction of the Cherokee Nation’s courts.
      (2)   Purpose:
         (a)   This agreement is entered into for the purpose of supporting
tribal and community cooperation in an effort to ensure public safety within
the Cherokee Reservation and within the town. This agreement shall not concede
or confer jurisdiction on any Parties, but shall establish an administrative
process under which town peace officers, acting pursuant to a Cross Deputation
agreement with the Cherokee Nation, may issue criminal citations to Indian
perpetrators and non-Indian perpetrators subject to the special domestic
violence jurisdiction of the Nation as acknowledged by the 2013 reauthorization
of the Violence Against Women Act, Pub. L. No. 113-4, 127 Stat. 540.
         (b)   Both Indian perpetrators and non-Indian perpetrators subject to
the special domestic violence jurisdiction of the Nation shall hereinafter be
referred to as “Reservation defendant(s)”.
         (c)   The Parties recognize a shared interest in ensuring public
safety and therefore seek to efficiently and effectively process criminal
offenses occurring within the Reservation and necessarily, within the limits of
the town. Both the town and the Nation agree that it is in the best interest of
both parties to enter into this agreement regarding such matters.
      (3)   Application Of Laws:
         (a)   This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the United States and the laws of the Cherokee
Nation. If it should appear that any terms contained herein are in conflict
with any rule of law or statutory provisions of the United States or the laws
of the Nation, such conflicting terms shall be deemed inoperative and declared
null and void in so far as it may be in conflict with such relevant law or
statutory provision, and shall be deemed modified to conform to such rules of
law or statutory provisions. However, such conflict shall not operate to
nullify or void this entire Agreement.
         (b)   This Agreement shall apply to offenses committed by Reservation
defendants which, if committed by a non-Indian defendant against a non-Indian
victim within the town, would be subject to prosecution by the town under its
own municipal jurisdiction.
      (4)   Term: The term of this agreement shall begin on the date it is
executed by both the Nation and the town and shall extend for a period of one
(1) year, and shall automatically renew for one (1) year periods thereafter.
This agreement ay be cancelled by mutual consent of the parties or by thirty
(30) days written notice of one party to the other, with or without cause. Said
notice shall state the reasons for the cancellation and be sent by certified
mail to the other party at the address contained herein.
      (5)   The Town Agrees To:
         (a)   Continue to abide by the terms and conditions provided in the
attached Cross Deputization Agreement with the Nation;
         (b)   Provide all management, staff, employees, facilities, buildings,
equipment, and supplies necessary to administratively process criminal matters
involving Reservation defendants;
         (c)   Identify Reservation defendants and maintain a separate
accounting system within the town court clerk’s office;
         (d)   Ensure that all guilty pleas, warrants or other judicial actions
involving Reservation defendants that require a judge’s signature or court
approval be forwarded for consideration and execution by a Cherokee Nation
District Court Judge. Promptly refer matters in which any Reservation defendant
has entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a trial to the Cherokee Nation
Attorney General for review and prosecution and transmit all related
documentation;
         (e)   Ensure cooperation of town employees in prosecutions of
Reservation defendants;
         (f)   Collect fees, fines and costs from each Reservation defendant;
         (g)   Remit thirty dollars ($30.00) from the total amount paid by each
Reservation defendant to the Cherokee Nation along with a copy of the citation
and a record of the total fee, fine, and cost paid by the defendant. Payment to
the Nation will be made on a monthly basis;
         (h)   Retain all other fees, fines, and costs as a donation from the
Cherokee Nation;
         (i)   Ensure that all fines, fees and costs collected from Reservation
defendants are collected consistently and in accordance with the fine and fee
schedule produced by the Nation;
         (j)   Provide a monthly accounting to the Nation of all fines, fees
and costs collected and remitted; and
         (k)   Records of payments received from and sent to the Nation shall
be maintained by the town pursuant to this Agreement and shall be made
available to the Nation at any time.
      (6)   The Nation Agrees To:
         (a)   Abide by the terms and conditions provided in the Cross
Deputization Agreement with the town;
         (b)   Engage with the town to administratively process tribal criminal
offenses occurring within the Reservation and necessarily, within the limits of
the town involving Reservation defendants;
         (c)   Accept referrals for prosecution in tribal court, through the
Office of the Attorney General, for those cases involving Reservation
defendants who plead not guilty and demand a trial;
         (d)   Donate the amount of fines, fees, and costs paid by each
Reservation defendant, less thirty dollars ($30.00), to the town in recognition
of the public safety and administrative functions performed by the town;
         (e)   Records of payments received from and sent to the town shall be
maintained by the Nation pursuant to this Agreement and shall be made available
to the town at any time; and
         (f)   Retain all fees, fines, and costs collected from those
Reservation defendants prosecuted in the Cherokee Nation District Court after
entering a not guilty plea and demanding a trial.
      (7)   General Provisions:
         (a)   This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the
parties. This Agreement shall supersede all prior or contemporaneous
understandings, representations, or warranties not set forth herein. No
subsequent amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be of any force or
effect unless in writing and signed by the parties to be bound thereby. No
provision of this Agreement shall be considered waived by the Nation or the
town unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party. No such waiver
shall be a waiver of any past or future default, breach, or modification of any
provision of this Agreement unless expressly stipulated in such a waiver. The
parties further state to the best of their knowledge, no employee of the Nation
or town who exercises any functions or responsibilities in connection with the
performance of the duties under this Agreement has any personal interest,
direct or indirect, in this Agreement.
         (b)   That each party to the Agreement hereby recognizes that the
other shall not control the means or methods by which the terms of this
Agreement and the duties outlined herein are rendered. Both parties agree to

and pursuant to lawful standards.

as who views it. No property shall be released except upon written request of

of the Cherokee Nation or his or her designee. The town further agrees to

the Cherokee Nation Attorney General.
         (d)   The town, its subcontractors, agents and employees shall not be
considered employees of the Nation and shall not be eligible for any benefits
associated herewith. Likewise, the Nation, its subcontractors, agents and
employees shall not be considered employees of the town and shall not be

this Agreement until the Reservation defendant has fulfilled their obligation
and paid the amount due in full.

other appropriate officer or agency of the town government to take immediate
and proper action summarily to abate such nuisances or to reduce or suspend the
danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   (B)   Submission Of Statement Of Nuisance: An officer of the town may submit
a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of

the nuisance within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be

(1998 Code § 10-505)
§ 5-5A-3 AGE AND HOUR RESTRICTIONS; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Age; Hours: It is unlawful for any person under eighteen (18) years of

street during the nocturnal hours for which subsection (A) of this section is
intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not, however, be
considered in violation of this article:
      (1)   When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
      (2)   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor
to take the parent’s place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
      (3)   When exercising first amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech
and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona tides of such
exercise by possessing a written communication, signed by such minor, and
countersigned by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone
number, specifying when, and where and in what manner the minor will be on the
streets at night (during hours when this article is otherwise applicable to the
minor) in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such
communication.
      (4)   In case of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in the
minor’s possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned
by a parent of such minor evidencing their home address and telephone number,
and establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a
designated time for a described purpose, including points of origin and

resides, or on the sidewalk of either next door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer.

telephone number, the purpose for the event, when, where and in what manner the
minor will be on the streets at night.
      (7)   When authorized, by regulation issued by the town board, in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to
necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on
an individual special permit basis. Normally, such regulation by the town board
permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to
permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such
as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
streets permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than thirty
(30) minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason

the public interest and the purposes of this article.

include the latest payroll receipt not over thirty (30) days old.

minor in that parent’s legal custody.
   (C)   Parental Responsibility: It is intended to continue to keep neglectful

that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
   (D)   Business Owner Or Operator: It shall be unlawful for any person
operating or having charge of any public place to knowingly allow, permit or
suffer the presence of minors in violation of the curfew established by this

§ 5-5A-5 LAW ENFORCEMENT; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Police Procedures:
      (1)   Upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets
in prima facie violation of this article, a police officer of the town shall
normally take the minor to the town police station, or other place designated
by the chief of police, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come
for such minor, whereupon they shall be interviewed. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the personnel then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making
available experienced supervisory personnel, the best facilities and access to
information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth
certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his
best judgment in determining age.
      (2)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the police officer may deliver to
a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances. For example, a minor
of tender age near home whose identity may readily be ascertained or is known.
      (3)   In any event, such police officer shall, within twenty four (24)
hours, file a written report with the chief of police. The report shall be
treated for purposes of juvenile records in accordance with state statutes.
      (4)   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will, on
behalf of a parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
      (5)   In the case of first violation by a minor, the chief of police
shall cause to be personally delivered or by certified mail, send to a parent
written notice of violation with a warning that any subsequent violation shall
result in full enforcement of this article, including enforcement of parental
responsibility and of applicable penalties.
   (B)   Penalty: If after the warning notice pursuant to subsection (A)(5) of
this section of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates section
5-5A-4 of this article (in connection with a second violation by the minor),
this shall be treated as an offense by the parent. The penalty upon a plea of
guilty, nolo contendere, or finding of guilt shall be as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code.

§ 5-5B-1 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   The town board of trustees find that youth addiction to tobacco products is
a public health problem with grave health consequences. In recognition that
almost ninety percent (90%) of all smokers begin smoking by the age of eighteen
(18), action is needed to curtail the easy access of minors to cigarettes and
other addictive tobacco products. Furthermore, the town trustees find that the
Oklahoma state legislature has limited the powers granted to local governments
to address the problem of youth access to tobacco. Therefore, the intent of
this article is to:
   (A)   Implement the strictest and most enforceable system allowed under
Oklahoma state law to prevent the illegal sale of cigarettes and other tobacco
products to minors;
   (B)   Periodically amend and update this article as necessary to best
utilize any applicable powers which may return to Oklahoma municipalities in
the future; and
   (C)   Educate, encourage and assist underage tobacco users in ceasing all
use of addictive tobacco products, preferably before daily use of such products
is initiated.
(2013 Code)
§ 5-5B-2 DEFINITIONS.

for the purpose of promoting the product.

resulting from the offense, except that the defendant is considered to have
been convicted of the offense if the defendant subsequently convicted of the
same charge if such a repeat offense occurs within one year of the dismissed
offense.

set aside for use by vehicles making left turns in both directions from or into
the roadway. Two-way left turn lanes shall be designated by distinctive roadway
markings consisting of parallel double yellow lines, interior line dashed and

turn from or into a roadway. Vehicles turning left from the roadway shall not
be driven in the two-way left turn lane for more than two hundred feet (200’)
while preparing for and making the turn. A vehicle turning left onto the
roadway may utilize the two-way left turn lane as a staging area by stopping
and waiting for traffic proceeding in the same direction to clear before
merging into the adjacent lanes of travel. A left turn shall not be made from
any other lane where a two-way left turn lane has been designated. Provided,
however, this subsection shall not prohibit driving across a two-way left turn
lane when moving from a service drive onto such marked roadway.
      (4)   Upon a roadway which is divided into four (4) or more lanes, a
vehicle proceeding at less than the maximum posted speed, except when reduced
speed is necessary for safe operation, shall not impede the normal flow of
traffic by driving in the left lane. The vehicle shall be driven in the right
hand lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction or when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a
private road or driveway.

§ 6-2-10 DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE.
   (A)   Driving While Under The Influence:
      (1)   It is unlawful for any person to drive, operate, or be in actual
physical control of a motor vehicle, who:
(1998 Code § 15-211)
         (a)   Has a blood alcohol concentration, as defined in 47 O.S. § 756,
of ten-hundredths (0.10) or more at the time of a test of such person’s blood
or breath administered within two (2) hours after the arrest of such person;
(1998 Code § 15-211; 2013 Code)
         (b)   Is under the influence of alcohol;
         (c)   Is under the influence or any other intoxicating substance to a
degree which renders such person incapable of safely driving or operating a
motor vehicle; or
         (d)   Is under the combined influence of alcohol and any other
intoxicating substance to a degree which renders such person incapable of
safely driving or operating a motor vehicle.
      (2)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of this
subsection is or has been lawfully entitled to use alcohol or a controlled
dangerous substance or any other intoxicating substance shall not constitute a
defense against any charge of violating this subsection.
      (3)   As used in this section, the term OTHER INTOXICATING SUBSTANCE
means any controlled dangerous substance as defined in the uniform controlled
dangerous substances act and any other substance, other than alcohol, which is
capable of being ingested, inhaled, injected or absorbed into the human body
and is capable of adversely affecting the central nervous system, vision,
hearing or other sensory or motor function.

less by weight of alcohol in his blood is prima facie evidence that the person
was not under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating liquor.
      (2)   Evidence that there was more than five-hundredths of one percent
(0.05%) by weight of alcohol in the person’s blood is relevant evidence of
operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is
impaired by the consumption of alcohol or intoxicating liquor; however, no
person shall be convicted of the offense of operating a motor vehicle while his
ability to operate such vehicle is impaired by consumption of alcohol or
intoxicating liquor solely because there was more than five-hundredths of one
percent (0.05%) by weight of alcohol in the person’s blood in the absence of
additional evidence that such person’s driving was affected by the consumption
of alcohol to the extent that the public health and safety was threatened or
that the person had violated a state statute or local ordinance in the
operation of a motor vehicle.
      (3)   Evidence that there was ten-hundredths of one percent (0.10%) or
more by weight of alcohol in his blood shall be admitted as prima facie

liquor.
      (4)   Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams
of alcohol per one hundred milliliters (100 ml) of blood.
      (5)   To be admissible, such evidence must first be qualified by
establishing that such specimen was obtained from the subject within not more
than two (2) hours of the arrest of the subject.

space, barrier or section, except through a permanent opening in the dividing
space, barrier or section or at a permanent crossover or intersection as

(Ord. 2021-5, passed 12-21-2021)
§ 8-3-5 CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE TO PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (A)   Requirement to Obtain a Permit. No person or facility shall discharge
industrial waste to the Town of Big Cabin public sewer without first obtaining
a permit from the Authority authorizing such discharge. Discharge of industrial
waste to the public sewer prior to obtaining a permit from the Authority shall
constitute a violation of this Ordinance punishable by fines and penalties in
accordance with Section 8-3-10, and shall be subject to immediate disconnection
from the public sewer.
   (B)   Industrial Pretreatment Permit. Any facility with an industrial
discharge that is subject to the pre-treatment permitting requirements under
the Oklahoma Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act, 27A O.S. §§ 2-6-201 et
seq. shall apply for and receive such permit prior to any discharge to the
sewage system. The facility shall provide a copy of such permit application,
and all supporting materials, to the Authority concurrently with their
submission to ODEQ. No permit for an industrial discharge to the Town of Big
Cabin sewage system shall be granted by the Authority unless and until an
Industrial Pretreatment Permit is issued (or determined to be unnecessary) by
ODEQ and provided by the discharger to the Authority.
   (C)   Pretreatment. If, in the opinion of the Authority, to modify or
eliminate wastes that may be harmful to the structures, processes or operation
of the sewage system or wastewater treatment works, the discharger shall
provide at the discharger’s expense such pretreatment or processing facilities
as may be required to render the discharger’s wastes acceptable for admission
to the sewage system and shall obtain any necessary Industrial Pretreatment
Permits from ODEQ. Where pre-treatment or flow equalizing facilities are
provided or required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation at the expense of the
owner(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection,
Industrial Users discharging industrial wastewater or wastes with pollutants in
excess of the levels set forth in the definition of Normal Domestic Sewage
(Section 8-3-1), i.e., BOD - 300 mg/l, TSS - 250 mg/l, Phosphorous 3.67 mg/
l and Kjeldahl Nitrogen - 25 mg/l) shall provide, at the Industrial User’s
expense such pretreatment or processing facilities as may be required to
pretreat the industrial wastes such that BOD, TSS, phosphorous and total
kjeldahl nitrogen do not exceed the levels specified in the definition of
Normal Domestic Sewage.
   (D)   Submission of Information. Plans, specifications, any other pertinent
information relating to proposed flow equalization, pretreatment or processing
facilities shall be submitted for review of the Authority prior to the start of
their construction if the effluent from such facilities is to be discharged
into the sewage system. Copies of all applications for wastewater pretreatment
or discharge permits and related information submitted to ODEQ shall be
simultaneously submitted to the Authority.
   (E)   Permit Transfer Prohibited. No permit issued by the Authority for the
discharge of industrial waste from an existing facility may be transferred to a
new owner or operator of such facility written approval and authorization from
the Authority. Any application submitted to ODEQ for transfer of an existing
pre-treatment permit shall be concurrently provided to the Authority.
   (F)   Submission of Data. Any facility discharging industrial waste to the
public sewer for which the Authority has not been provided with representative
effluent data by the owner or operator thereof, shall, as directed by the
Authority, prepare and submit to the Authority a report that shall include
pertinent data pertaining to the nature, quantity, characteristics and
composition of the industrial wastes discharged to the public sewer and full
details of the type of pretreatment provided to such wastes (including, but not
limited to, a full description of all processes, chemicals, and equipment
utilized and all wastes, byproducts and effluents, generated therefrom).
Similarly, each facility proposing to make a new connection to public sewer for
the purpose of discharging industrial wastes shall prepare and file with the
Authority a report that shall include actual or predicted data and information
pertaining to the nature, quantity, characteristics and composition of the
industrial waste to be discharged to the public sewer and full details of the
type of pretreatment provided to such wastes.
   (G)   Industrial Discharges. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or
proposed to be discharged, to the public sewers, which possess characteristics
not generally found in normal domestic sewage, or which contain substances in
excess of the amounts generally found in normal domestic sewage, or which in
the judgment of the Authority:
      (1)   May be acutely or chronically tonic to aquatic life and wild and
domestic animals.
      (2)   May adversely affect humans and cause increased risk of cancer in
humans.
      (3)   May impart undesirable tastes or odors to surface waters or aquatic
organisms ingested by humans.
      (4)   May prevent present or prospective future use of surface waters for
public and private water supplies.
      (5)   May prevent propagation of fish and aquatic life and wild and
domestic animal life.
      (6)   May create unacceptable limitations for current and future methods
of sludge recycling/disposal.
      (7)   May have incompatible pollutants, or deleterious effects upon the
sewage system, wastewater treatment works, land disposal areas, or the
processes, equipment, or capacity thereof.
      (8)   May cause additional requirements or limitations to become part of
the Town of Big Cabin’s OPDES discharge permit.
      (9)   May violate any of the prohibitions in Section 8-3-3, Div. F.
      (10)   Or may otherwise create a hazard to life, health or constitute a
public nuisance.
   (H)   The Authority may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes and immediately disconnect the industrial user
from the public sewers;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable limit for discharge to the
public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges.
   (I)   Control Manholes. Each user discharging industrial wastes into a
public sewer may be required by the Authority to construct and maintain one or
more control manholes or access points to facilitate observation, measurement
and sampling of such user’s wastes, including domestic sewage. Within one (1)
month after written notification from the Authority, any such user shall
complete construction of the control manholes or access points.
      (1)   Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in
a manner that is accessible and safely located and otherwise acceptable to the
Authority. If measuring devices are to be permanently installed they shall be
of a type acceptable to the Authority.
      (2)   Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be
installed by the facility discharging the waste, at its expense, and shall be
maintained by such facility so as to be in safe condition, accessible, and in
proper operating condition at all times. Plans for installation of the control
manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall be approved by the
Authority prior to the beginning of construction.
      (3)   Alternatively, the Authority may choose to install the control
manholes, access facilities, and related equipment at the facility discharging
the waste. Expenses incurred for this service, however, are the responsibility
of the facility discharging the waste.
   (J)   Metering and Sampling of Industrial Waste.
      (1)   General. Users designated by the Authority with high levels of flow
or with industrial discharge may be required to have metering and sampling
facilities. The Authority shall make a determination as to when metering of
high levels of flow or such industrial discharge is needed as well as what
frequency of sampling of the industrial discharge is needed. Metering and
sampling devices shall be installed, owned and maintained by the discharger
subject to the approval of the Authority. Access to the metering and sampling
location shall be granted to the Authority and the Director at all times.
Within two (2) months after written notification from the Authority, the
selected users shall complete the installation of metering and sampling
devices. Alternatively, the Authority may choose to install or maintain the
metering and sampling devices at the facility discharging the industrial waste.
Expenses incurred for this service, however, are the responsibility of the
facility discharging the waste.
      (2)   Metering. Devices for measuring the volume of wastewater discharged
may also be required by the Authority if the volume cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (3)   Sampling. The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the Authority, be required
to provide laboratory measurements, tests, or analyses of waters or wastes to
illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special conditions for
discharge established by the Authority or other regulatory agencies having;
jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type, and frequency of sampling
and laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by
the Authority. The owner must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of
the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with Federal, State and
local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the Authority at such times and in such
manner as prescribed by the Authority. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the Authority. At such times
as deemed necessary, the Authority reserves the right to take measurements and
samples for analysis by an independent laboratory.
      (4)   Inspection. Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers
shall be subject to periodic inspections and a determination of character and
concentration of said wastes. Sampling shall be conducted in such a manner as
to be representative of the composition of the waste. Every care shall be
exercised in collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state
comparable to that at the time the sample was taken. The sampling may be
accomplished either manually or by the use of automated and/or mechanical
equipment acceptable to the Authority. The use of flow proportional composite
sampling is preferred.
      (5)   Maintenance. A maintenance schedule for pretreatment equipment,
sampling and metering equipment and control manholes must be provided to and
accepted by the Authority. All maintenance and equipment repair shall be
performed within a reasonable time as determined by the Authority. Failure to
perform maintenance in accordance with an approved schedule shall constitute a
violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the fines a ad penalties set
forth in Section 8-3-10 of this chapter. Prior to completion of satisfactory
repairs, and for any preceding period during which the Authority determines
there existed a malfunction, error or bias in the metering and sampling, the
volume and characteristics of the wastewater for that period discharged by the
discharger shall be based on historical data and a reasonable engineering
estimate of flow, characteristics and composition, taking account of material
known production variations, all as determined by the Authority in consultation
with the discharger. If prolonged periods of breakdown are anticipated,
approved interim measuring and sampling needs shall be provided, and used to
determine the volume and composition of wastewater.
      (6)   Following approval and installation of permanent or temporary
metering or sampling equipment, such equipment shall not be removed without the
consent of the Authority.
   (K)   Analysis. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics
of wastewater and water to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health
Association. Sampling methods, location, times, durations, and frequencies are
to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the Authority.
Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes shall
be made by the facility discharging them, or its agent, as designated and
required by the Authority. The Authority may also make its own analyses on the
wastes and these determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges.
   (L)   Accidental Discharges. Where required by the Authority, the owner of
any property serviced by a sanitary sewer shall provide protection from an
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter. Where necessary, equipment and facilities to prevent accidental
discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
owner’s expense. Detailed plans showing equipment, facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Authority for
review and approval prior to construction. Review and approval off such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve any user from the responsibility to
modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter. Users shall notify the Director immediately upon having a slug or
accidental discharge of substances or wastewater in violation of this chapter
to enable countermeasures to be taken by the Director to minimize damage to the
wastewater treatment works. Such notification will not relieve any user of any
liability tor any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system or
treatment process, or far any fines imposed on the Town of Big Cabin on account
thereof under any State and Federal law. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or discover such a discharge are trained on emergency
notification and response procedures.
   (M)   Obstructions. No person, having charge of any building or other
premises which drains into the public sewer, shall permit any substance or
matter which may form a deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the public
sewer. Within ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from the
Authority, the owner shall install a suitable and sufficient catch basin or
waste trap, or if one already exists, shall clean out, repair or alter the
same, and perform such other work as the Director may deem necessary. Upon the
owner’s refusal or neglect to install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean
out, repair, or alter the same after the period of one hundred and twenty (120)
days, the Authority may cause such work to be completed at the expense of the
owner or representative thereof. Whenever any service connection becomes
clogged, obstructed, broken or out of order, or detrimental to the use of the
public sewer, or unfit for the purpose of drainage, the owner shall repair or
cause such work to be done as the Director may direct. Each day after seven (7)
days that a person neglects or fails to so act shall constitute a separate
violation of this chapter, and the Director may then cause the work to be done,
and recover from such owner or agent the expense thereof.
   (N)   Grease and/or Sand Interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Authority, they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable oil in excessive
amounts or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Authority, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors the owner(s)
shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of
disposal which are subject to review by the Authority. Any removal and hauling
of the collected materials not performed by owner(s) personnel must be
performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (O)   Dilution Prohibited. No user shall increase the use of process water
or, in any manner, attempt to dilute a discharge as impartial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in this chapter, or contained in the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, or any state requirements.
   (P)   Violations. Violation of any of the provisions of this Section shall
render the discharger subject to immediate suspension and/or revocation of his
disposal privileges and may make the discharger liable pursuant to the penalty
provision of Section 8-3-10 of this chapter.
(Ord. 2021-5, passed 12-21-2021; Ord. 2022-1, passed 3-3-2022)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 9-4-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has in Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act, 82
O.S. §§ 1601 through 1620.1 delegated the responsibility of local governmental
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the
town does ordain this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-4, passed 12-12-2024)
§ 9-4-2 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of town are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 2024-4, passed 12-12-2024)
§ 9-4-3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 2024-4, passed 12-12-2024)
§ 9-4-4 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

   (C)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal emergency
management agency upon request;
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section
9-4-27(B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (section
9-4-3).
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances shall be as follows.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon showing a good and sufficient
cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the granting of
a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria outlined in subsections
(A) through (I) of this section are met; and the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety.

27(A)(1) is satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) at or above the base
flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for
the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this
subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two (2) openings on separate walls having a total net
area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding shall be provided;
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade; and
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Manufactured Homes:
      (1)   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a
community’s FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize
flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be
elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top
or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites outside
of a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the bottom of the I-beam is
elevated at or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. The manufactured home shall
be installed by a licensed installer according to state law and compliance
herewith shall be certified in writing to the floodplain administrator by said
installer prior to habitation of the manufactured home.
      (3)   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30,
AH and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
subsection (D) of this section be elevated so that either the manufactured home
chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at
least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   (E)   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A, A1-30, AH and AE on the county FIRM either:
      (1)    Be on a site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
      (3)   Meet the permit requirements of section 9-4-27, and the elevation
and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (D) of this
section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by a quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
   (F)   Accessory Structure: Accessory structures to be placed on sites within
Zones A and AE on the county FIRM shall comply with the following:
      (1)   The structure shall be used only for parking and limited storage;
      (2)   The structure shall not be used for human habitation. Prohibited
activities or uses include, but are not limited to, working, sleeping, living,
cooking, or restroom use;
      (3)   The structure shall be unfinished on the interior;
      (4)   Structures shall be small in size, not exceed six hundred (600)
square feet in size;
      (5)   Structures exceeding six hundred (600) square feet in size will be
required to meet all applicable standards of sections 9-4-8, 9-4-27, 9-4-40 and
9-4-41 including relevant subsections;
      (6)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment must be
elevated to or above the BFE;
      (7)   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
      (8)   The structure shall be considered low in value, designed to have
low flood damage potential and constructed with flood resistance materials;
      (9)   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse and lateral movement;
      (10)   Floodway requirements must be met in the construction of the
structure;
      (11)   Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be
provided below the BFE; and be placed on opposing walls with the net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of the size of the
footprint of the structure (flood vents);
      (12)   The openings (flood vents) shall be located no higher than one
foot above (1') grade; and
      (13)   The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
