alleys, parks, buildings, or other public premises or property. For each day of
such work, the prisoner shall be credited for serving one day of imprisonment
under his or her sentence.

§ 33.074 PENALTY AND ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   Any person convicted of an offense punishable by a fine of $10 or more
or by incarceration, excluding parking and standing violations, or any person
forfeiting bond when charged with such an offense, shall be ordered by the
court to pay $4 as a separate penalty assessment, which shall be in addition to
and not in substitution for any and all fines and penalties otherwise provided
for by law for such offense. The court shall provide for separate bail for the
penalty assessment. A defendant admitted to bail on an undertaking by a surety
may include the amount of the penalty assessment in the undertaking.
   (B)   Upon conviction or bond forfeiture, the court shall collect the
penalty assessment and deposit it in an account created for that purpose. As an
administrative fee for handling funds collected as a penalty assessment, the
court is authorized to retain 2% of such monies and may also retain all
interest accrued thereon prior to the due date for deposits as provided in this
division (B). The remainder of such monies shall be forwarded quarterly by the
Court Clerk to the State Treasury. Deposits shall be due July 15 for the
preceding quarter ending June 30, October 15 for the preceding quarter ending
September 30, January 15 for the preceding quarter ending December 31, and
April 15 for the preceding quarter ending March 31.

   (A)   All prosecutions for violation of ordinances of this city shall be
styled “The City of Hobart, Oklahoma vs. (naming defendant or defendants)”.
Except as provided hereinafter, prosecutions shall be initiated by the filing
of a written complaint, subscribed and verified by the person making the
complaint, and setting forth concisely the offense charged.
   (B)   There is no duty on the part of the city or any of its officers or
employees to formally prosecute actions in the court. In the absence of a
Prosecuting Officer, the Judge shall proceed with the case and hear evidence
and examine witnesses in such manner as he may deem necessary to effect
justice.
   (C)   Any person, except a police officer or other employee of the city,
filing a criminal offense complaint in the Municipal Court shall deposit with
the Clerk of the Court, unless waived by order of the Court, the court cost fee
$25. The court costs so deposited by such a complainant shall be refunded to
the complainant or person depositing same upon conviction or acquittal of the
defendant; the court costs shall not be refunded if the charges are dismissed
at the request of the complainant who made the deposit because the complainant
fails or refuses to appear in Court to testify or aid in the prosecution of the
charge filed by such complainant.
   (D)   All defects in the form or substance apparent on the face of a
complaint charging a violation of an ordinance of this city, and being grounds
for motion or demur, may only be raised by an accused in writing and prior to
trial.
   (E)   A complaint may be amended in matter of substance or form at any time
before the defendant pleads, without leave, and may be amended after plea or
order of the Court where the same can be done without material prejudice to the
rights of the defendant. No amendment shall cause any delay of the trial,
unless good cause is shown by affidavit.

appeals bond in cash or sureties for cash equal to twice the amount of the fine

Municipal Judge.

(Prior Code, § 7-604) (Ord. 06-03, passed 12-12-2005, effective 2-15-2006)

responsible for the collection of the tax from the occupant and shall be liable
to the city for the tax.
   (C)   Records to be kept. Every operator shall keep records of every
occupancy and all rent paid, charged, or due thereon and of the tax payable
thereon in such forms as the City Clerk may require. Such records shall be
available for inspection and examination at any time upon demand by the City
Clerk, or duly authorized agent or employee of the city and shall be preserved
for a period of three years from the date thereof except that the City Clerk
may consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be
kept longer.
   (D)   Returns.
      (1)   Every operator shall file with the City Clerk a return of occupancy
and of rents and of the taxes payable thereon for the period ending June 30,
September 30, December 31, and March 31 of each year from the effective date
hereof.
      (2)   The City Clerk may permit or require returns to be made by shorter
or longer periods and upon such dates as he or she may specify. The form of
return shall be prescribed by the City Clerk and shall contain such
information, as he or she may deem necessary for the proper administration of
this subchapter. The City Clerk may require amended returns to be filed within
20 days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice.
   (E)   Payment of tax. At the time of filing a return of occupancy and of
rents, each operator shall pay to the City Clerk the taxes imposed by this
subchapter upon the rents included in such return, as well as all other monies
collected by the operator acting or purporting to act under the provisions of
this subchapter. All the taxes for the period for which a return is required to
be filed shall be due from the operator and payable to the City Clerk on or
before the date fixed for the filing of the return for such period without
regard to whether a return is filed or whether the return which is filed
correctly shows the amount of rents and the taxes due thereon.
   (F)   Bond required. When the City Clerk believes that any operator is about
to cease business, leave the state, or remove or dissipate assets, or for any
other similar reason he or she deems it necessary in order to protect revenues
under this subchapter, he or she may require such operator to file with the
city a bond issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this
state in such amount as the City Clerk may fix to secure the payment of any tax
or penalties and interest due, or which may become due from such operator. In
the event that the City Clerk determines that an operator is to file such bond,
he or she shall give notice to such operator specifying the amount of bond
required. The operator shall file such bond within five days after the giving
of such notice unless within such five days the operator shall request in
writing a hearing before the City Council or its designee, at such the
propriety and amount of the bond shall be determined by the City Council or its
designee. Such determination shall be final and shall be complied with within
15 days thereafter. In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the City
Clerk, or cash in such amount as he or she may prescribe, may be deposited with
the City Clerk, who may at any time after five days’ notice to the depositor,
apply them to any tax and/or any penalties due and for the purpose the
securities may be sold at private or public sale.
   (G)   Assessment and determination of tax. If a return required by this
subchapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or
insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be assessed by the City Clerk from
such information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, the tax may be
estimated on the basis of external indices, such as number of rooms, location,
scale of rents, comparable rents, types of accommodations and services, number
of employees, or other factors; provided, however, such assessment shall in no
event exceed the amount of tax that was due and payable and such assessment
procedure shall not be performed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Written
notice of such assessment shall be given to the person liable for the
collection and payment of the tax. Such assessment shall finally and
irrevocably fix and determine the tax unless the person, against whom it is
assessed, shall apply in writing to the City Council or its designee for a
hearing or unless the City Clerk on his or her own motion shall reassess the
same. After such hearing, the City Council or its designee shall give written
notice of its determination to the person against whom the tax is assessed and
such determination shall be final.
   (H)   Refunds.
      (1)   Refund procedure. The City Clerk shall refund or credit any tax
erroneously collected if written application to the City Clerk for such refund
shall be made within two years from the date of payment thereof. For like
causes, and in the same period, a refund may be so made upon the initiative and
the order of the City Clerk. Whenever a refund is made, the reasons therefor
shall be stated in writing. Such application may also be made by the person who
has collected and paid such tax to the City Clerk providing that the
application is made within two years of the payment of the occupant to the
operator, but no refund of money shall be made to the operator until he or she
has repaid to the occupant the amount for which the application for refund is
made. The City Clerk in lieu of any refund required to be made, may allow
credit therefor on payment due from the applicant.
      (2)   Determination and hearings. Upon application for a refund, the City
Clerk may receive evidence with respect thereto, and make such investigation as
he or she deems necessary. After making a determination as to the refund, the
City Clerk shall give notice thereof to the applicant. Such determination shall
be final unless the applicant within 90 days after such notice shall apply in
writing to the City Council or its designee for a hearing. After such hearing,
the City Council or its designee shall give written notice of its decision to
the applicant.
   (I)   Notices. Notices provided for under this subchapter shall be deemed to
have been given when such notice has been delivered personally to the operator
or deposited in the United States mail to the last known address of the
operator.
   (J)   Remedies exclusive. The remedies provided in this subchapter shall be
exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability

and duties under this subchapter. The City Clerk shall have the power to

papers, and documents to secure information pertinent to the performance of his
or her duties hereunder and all the enforcement of this subchapter and to
examine them in relation thereto.
   (M)   Collection permits. Every operator shall apply for a collection permit
from the City Clerk in a form prescribed by said City Clerk within ten days
after the effective date hereof, or in the case of operators commencing
business or opening new hotels after such effective dates, within three days
after such commencement or opening. The City Clerk shall, within five days
after such application issue, without charge, to each operator a collection
permit empowering such operator to collect the tax from the occupant and
duplicates thereof for each additional hotel. Each collection permit or
duplicate shall state the hotel or motel to which it is applicable. Such
collection permits shall be permanently displayed by the operator in such
manner that it may be seen and comes to the notice of all occupants and persons
seeking occupancy. Said permits shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and
shall be surrendered immediately to the City Clerk upon the cessation of
business at the hotel named, or upon its sale, lease, assignment or transfer.

tax at the rate of 1.5% per month on the unpaid balance from the date of
delinquency.
   (O)   Delinquent taxes. The tax levied by this subchapter shall be due and

impaired by the consumption of alcohol or intoxicating liquor; however, no
person shall be convicted while his or her ability to operate such vehicle is
impaired by consumption of alcohol or intoxicating liquor solely because there

was tested. The provisions of this division do not limit the introduction of
any other competent evidence bearing on the question of whether the person was
under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating liquor; and
      (4)   To be admissible in a proceeding, the evidence must first be
qualified by establishing that the test was administered to the person within
two hours after the arrest of the person.

proceeding. A driver who enters a yield intersection without stopping and has
or causes a collision with a pedestrian at a crosswalk or a vehicle in the
intersection shall prima facie be considered not to have yielded as required
herein. The provisions of this section shall not release the drivers of other
vehicles approaching the intersection at such a distance as not to constitute
immediate hazard from the duty to drive with due care to avoid a collision. The
driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign if required for safety to stop
shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection
before entering the intersection; if there is no crosswalk, the driver shall
stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if there is no stop line, then at the

§ 72.05 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   The display of signal lights, arrows, and words shall be deemed to have the
following meanings and requires the appropriate response on the part of
vehicular traffic and pedestrians.
   (A)   Green alone, “go.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless an official sign at such
place prohibits such turn, but any vehicle and any pedestrian lawfully within
the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal displays green
shall have the right-of-way over such vehicular traffic; and
      (2)   Pedestrian traffic, facing a green signal, may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless a “walk” signal
indicator is operating.
   (B)   Steady yellow or amber alone, “caution.”
      (1)   The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute a
warning that the “red” or “stop” signal will be exhibited immediately
thereafter; and
      (2)   Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near side
crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so near
the limit line when the “caution” signal first flashes that a stop cannot be
made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the
intersection and clear the same before the “red” signal flashes.
   (C)   Red alone, “stop.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk and shall remain standing until green, or “go” is shown alone. Except
where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns, vehicles in the right
traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may enter the intersection
cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield the right-of-
way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection and the turn shall
be made so as not to interfere in any way with traffic proceeding on a green
signal indication on the cross street; and
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the roadway
when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal
indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety.
No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or
“go” is shown alone unless authorized to do so, by a pedestrian “walk” signal.
   (D)   Steady red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic
lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated
by the arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the movement
indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be made only
on the red with green arrow signal; and
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or “go” is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian “walk”
signal.
   (E)   Green arrows alone. Whenever vehicular traffic movements are
controlled by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal
indication, vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by
the green arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are
displayed.

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers
of all vehicles; and
   (B)   Wait or Don’t Walk. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in
the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
his or her crossing on the “walk” signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety
zone while the “wait” signal is showing.

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject
to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign; and
      (2)   Flashing yellow. When a yellow light is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection,
or pass such signal only with caution.

§ 90.080 DOGS AND CATS CONFINED.
   (A)   When the Health Officer or Chief of Police determines and certifies
that a dog, a cat, or other animal in the city or within five miles of the city
is or was infected with rabies, and that an epidemic of rabies threatens the
city, the Council, by resolution, may order all dogs to be confined, and if

§ 90.081 QUARANTINE OF ANIMALS FOR OBSERVATION.
   (A)   The identity and address of the owner of any animal that bites a
person shall be promptly furnished to the Animal Control Officer and the County
Health Department. The animal, regardless of its immunization status, shall be
securely quarantined at a veterinary hospital of the owner’s choice at the
owner’s expense. The animal shall be observed by a licensed veterinarian for a
period of ten days, and may not be released until such reasonable determination
has been made that the animal is not infected with rabies, unless the bite was
a severe bite by an unimmunized animal. In circumstances of a severe bite (bite
on the head, face, neck or upper extremities; or deep laceration; or multiple
bite wounds) by an unimmunized animal, the biting animal should be humanely
killed immediately, without damaging the head, and the head removed and
shipped, under refrigeration, for examination at the Oklahoma State Department
of Health. If the animal is not immediately available for testing, the
individuals exposed should consult with their physician concerning the need for
immediate initiation for rabies prophylaxis. In case of animals whose ownership
is unknown, such quarantine shall be at the City Animal Shelter. If an owner
becomes known, the animal may be reclaimed by the owner if adjudged free of
rabies, and such owner shall then pay any related charges for confinement.
Signs of rabies in wild animals cannot be interpreted reliably; therefore, any
wild animal that exposes a person should be killed at once (without unnecessary
damage to the head) and the head submitted for examination for evidence of
rabies.
   (B)   It is the duty of every physician, veterinarian, or other practitioner
to report to the Animal Control Officer the names and addresses of persons
treated for bites inflicted by animals, together with such other information as
will be helpful in rabies control.
   (C)   It is the duty of every licensed veterinarian to report to the Animal
Control Officer his or her diagnosis of any animal observed by him or her to be
a rabid suspect.

such observation, the Animal Control Officer, veterinarian, the City Health
Officer, or other designated emissary shall immediately send the necessary part
of such animal to the State Health Department for pathological examination and
shall notify the proper public health officer of any reports of human contact.

§ 90.083 RABIES CRISIS DECLARATION.
   When a report gives a suspected or a positive diagnosis of rabies, or when
the city, county, or state health officials feel that a rabies crisis may be
imminent, the health officials may recommend to the Mayor city-wide quarantine,
and upon the invoking of such quarantine by the Mayor no animal shall be taken
into the streets or permitted to be in the streets, except for short periods of
exercise under leash and control of a competent adult. During the quarantine,
no animal may be taken or removed from the city without written permission of
the Animal Control Officer. This declaration must be made by notice in a
general circulated newspaper of the community and will last as long as health
officials determine the situation requires such action.

writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the City
Manager requires. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the City Manager shall
furnish a copy of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or
about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days
after receiving a complaint, or within 30 days after the expiration of any
period of reference under division (C) below, the City Manager shall
investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved
whether he or she intends to resolve it. If the City Manager decides to resolve

alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference,
conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of such
informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent
proceeding under this chapter without the written consent of the persons
concerned.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the aggregations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him or her and with the leave of the City Manager, which shall be
granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his or her
answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.

within 30 days of the complaint, the persons aggrieved may, within 30 days
hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint.
If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such
practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
City Manager shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary
compliance.

§ 91.11 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS; GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the City Manager shall have access at
all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals, and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and copy such
materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as
are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation; provided
however, that the City Manager first complies with the provisions of the fourth
amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The City Manager may
issue subpoenas to complete his or her access to or the production of such
materials, or the appearance of such person, and may issue interrogatories to a
respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations that would
apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a
civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the
investigation is taking place. The City Manager may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the City Manager, a respondent shall be
entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name
of the City Manager to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent and shall show on their face
the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued
at this request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the City Manager shall be entitled
to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in the
United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena
issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her. Within five
days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the
City Manager to revoke or modify the subpoena. The City Manager shall grant the
petition if he or she finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance
at unreasonable time or place, that it does not relate to any matter under
investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the
evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other
good reason.
   (D)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the City Manager
or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement
in the municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom
the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.
   (E)   Any person who wilfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence,
if in his or her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order
of the City Manager shall be subject to the penalties in §
91.99. Any person who, with intent to mislead the City Manager, shall make or
cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report, account,
record, or other document submitted to the City Manager pursuant to his or her
subpoena or other order or shall wilfully neglect or fail to make or cause to
be made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or
other documents or shall wilfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means
falsify any documentary evidence shall be subject to the penalties in §
91.99.
   (F)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the City
Manager participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.

   (A)   The rights granted by §§
91.03 through
91.06 may be enforced by civil action in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 180 days after the
alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided however, that the
court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
91.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the City Manager are likely to result in
satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complaint made
to the City Manager and which practice forms the basis for the action in court;
and provided, however, that any sale, encumbrance, or tenant without actual
notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the
provisions of this chapter shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of
a prevailing plaintiff. Provided, that the said plaintiff in the opinion of the
court is not financially able to assume said attorney fees.

§ 93.008 SUMMARY ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   Some nuisances are of such nature so as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of one or
more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances
may be such so as to justify, and even to require, the Mayor or other
appropriate officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and
proper action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the
danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   (B)   The Chief of the Fire Department, the Chief of Police, the City
Attorney, the Building Inspector, The Electrical Inspector, the Plumbing
Inspector or any other officer who is subordinate to the Mayor may submit
through or with the consent of the Mayor to the City Council, a statement as to
the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city of law,
and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The Mayor himself or
herself, the Health Officer, and the City Council, or any resident or residents
of the city, may submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the
Council.
   (C)   The Council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a
nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the
City Council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers
and other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated,
the City Council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to
the owner of any property concerned and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if
such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the
owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by
service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the
names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be
published in a paper of general circulation within the city.
   (D)   If the Council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons
responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within the specified
time, the Council shall direct the Mayor to abate the nuisance or to have it
abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 O.S. § 16. The
City Clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the
owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just
under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are known. Until paid,
such cost shall constitute a debt to the city collectible as other debts to the
city may be collected.
(Prior Code, § 8-308)
§ 93.009 ABATEMENT BY SUIT IN DISTRICT COURT.
   In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance the
city may bring suit in the district court of the county where the nuisance is
located, as provided in 50 O.S. § 17.
(Prior Code, § 8-309)
§ 93.010 NUISANCE UNLAWFUL.
   It is unlawful for any person, including but not limited to any owner,
leasee, or other person to create or maintain a nuisance within the city or to
permit a nuisance to remain on premises under his or her control within the
city.
(Prior Code, § 8-310) Penalty, see §
93.999
§ 93.011 HEALTH NUISANCES; ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 O.S. § 1-1011, the Health Officer
shall have authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises in
the city to remove from such premises, at his or her own expense, any source of
filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the breeding of insects or
rodents that might contribute to the transmission of disease/or any other
condition adversely affecting the public health, within 24 hours, or within
such other time as may be in writing and may be served personally on the owner
or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the Health Officer
or by a police officer or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of
abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state. If the
premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is
unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy
thereof on the premises or by publication in at least one issue of a newspaper
having a general circulation in the city.
   (B)   If the order is not complied with, the Health Officer may cause the
order to be executed and complied with and the cost thereof shall be certified
to the City Clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be
added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if
he or she is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility
service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it
is added and shall become due and payable, and subject to the same regulations
relating to delinquency in payment as the utility bill itself. If such owner or
occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost, after
certification to the City Clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any
other debt due the city may be collected.

different meaning.
      MINOR. Any person under the age of 18.

         (d)   A person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the
court.
      PUBLIC PLACE. Any street, alley, highway, sidewalk, park, playground, or

business, entertainment, or other lawful purpose. A PUBLIC PLACE shall include
but not be limited to any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley, café,

amusement or entertainment of the general public. It shall also include the
front or immediate area of the above.
      REMAIN. To stay behind, to tarry, and to stay unnecessarily upon the
streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors)
totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using
the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going

      STREET. A way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the
public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel, or in the case of
a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term STREET includes the legal
right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway or traffic lanes, the
curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other
grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a STREET.
      TIME OF NIGHT. The prevailing standard of time, whether central standard
time or central daylight saving time, generally observed at that hour by the
public.
      YEAR OF AGE. Continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to (but
not including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making it
clear that 17 OR LESS YEARS OF AGE is herein treated as equivalent to the
phrase UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE.
   (C)   Curfew times. It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of
age (under 18) to be or remain in or upon the streets within the city at night
during the period ending 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
      (1)   At 11:00 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday; and
      (2)   At 12:00 midnight on Friday and Saturday nights.
   (D)   Exceptions. In the following exceptional cases a minor on a city
street during the nocturnal hours for which division (C) above is intended to
provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not, however, be considered in
violation of this section:
      (1)   When accompanied by a parent of such minor;
      (2)   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor
to take the parent’s
place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of time and purpose
within a specified area;
      (3)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such
as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, and the right of assembly.
Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by possessing a
written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned, by a parent of
such minor and with their home address and telephone number, specifying when,
and where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets at night (during
hours when this section is otherwise applicable to the minor) in the exercise
of a First Amendment right specified in such communication;
      (4)   In case of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in the
minor’s possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned
by a parent of such minor evidencing their home address and telephone number,
and establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a
designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and
destination;
      (5)   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer;
      (6)   When returning home, by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes
of the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or
voluntary association, provided the minor has a written communication in the
minor’s possession, countersigned by the parent indicating the home address and
telephone number, the purpose for the event, when, where, and in what manner
the minor will be on the streets at night;
      (7)   When authorized, by a regulation issued by the City Council, in
other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to
necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on
an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the City
Council permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance
to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies
such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
streets permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than 30
minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason for
finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the
public interest and the purposes of this section;
      (8)   When the minor carries a certified card of employment, briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his or her home and his or her place of
employment and his or her hours of employment or carries a valid proof of
employment which may include the latest payroll receipt not over 30 days old;
or
      (9)   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. This clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement
through the city, particularly on normal routes.
   (E)   Parental responsibility. It shall be unlawful for a parent having
legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to
allow, such minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not
constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this section.
The term “knowingly” includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be
expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent’s legal
custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up
to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an
objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was
completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such
minor.
   (F)   Duty of police. A police officer of the city, upon finding or having
attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this
section, normally shall take the minor to the city police station, or other
place designated by the Chief of Police, where a parent shall immediately be
notified to come for such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is
intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant
facts, and to centralize responsibility in the personnel then on duty for
accurate, effective, fair, impartial, and uniform enforcement, and recording,
thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities
and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence
such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first
instance use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      (1)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the police officer may deliver to
a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor
of tender age near home whose identity may readily be ascertained or are known.
      (2)   In any event such police officer shall within 24 hours file a
written report with the Chief of Police, or shall participate to the extent of
the information for which he or she is responsible; the report shall be treated
for purposes of juvenile records in accordance with state statutes.
      (3)   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fail to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor, or other person who will on
behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
      (4)   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police
shall cause to be personally
delivered or by certified mail, send to a parent written notice of the
violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full
enforcement of this section including enforcement of parental responsibility
and of applicable penalties.
   (G)   Allowing minors in public place in violation of curfew. It shall be
unlawful for any person operating or having charge of any public place to
knowingly allow, permit or suffer the presence of minors in violation of the
curfew established by this section.

money or property which are not honored on account of insufficient funds of the
maker to pay same, as against the maker or drawer thereof. The making, drawing,
issuing or delivering of a check, draft, or order, payment of which is refused

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Prior Code, § 12-501) (Ord. 1089, passed 5-12-1987)
§ 151.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Prior Code, § 12-502) (Ord. 1089, passed 5-12-1987)
§ 151.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; or
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 12-503) (Ord. 1089, passed 5-12-1987)
§ 151.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may
be designated as zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed
ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone
A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   CRITICAL FEATURE. An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.

including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations.
   ELEVATED BUILDING.  
      (1)   A nonbasement building:
         (a)   Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO,
AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a
building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and pliers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of
the water; and
         (b)   Adequately anchored so at not to impair the structural integrity
of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood.
      (2)   In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO AH, B, C, X, D, ELEVATED
BUILDING also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement
of flood waters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, ELEVATED BUILDING also
includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of ELEVATED BUILDING, even
though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway
walls meet the standards of 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. For the purpose of determining rates, structures for
which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM
or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING
CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). The official map of a community on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated the boundaries of the

which have been designated as Zone A, M, or E.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM. The physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. (See definition of FLOODING.)
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that such
enclosure is not built to render the structure in violation of the applicable
non-elevation design requirement of 44 C.F.R. § 60.3 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain
management purposes the term MANUFACTURED HOME also includes park trailers,
travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than
180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term MANUFACTURED HOME does
not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.

National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which the
base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, structures for which
the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, being 16 U.S.C. §§ 3501
et seq., includes substantial improvement and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION, repair,
reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the
permit date. The actual START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or
walkways; nor does it include excavation of basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or shed
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure either:
         (a)   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
         (b)   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred.
      (2)   For the purpose of this definition SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
VARIANCE, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter. For full requirements, see 44 C.F.R. § 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure of other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, here specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.

forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
151.27(B) of this code have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter as set out in §
151.02.
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Pre-requisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the costs of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (J)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in divisions (A) through (I) above are met;
and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

§ 152.03 ZONES ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Municipal Airport. Such zones are shown
on the Municipal Airport airspace drawing consisting of one sheet, prepared by
Barnard Dunkelberg & Company and dated August 2001, which is attached to
Ordinance 02-01 and made a part hereof.
   (B)   An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered
to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
   (C)   The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      (1)   Utility Runway Nonprecision Approach Zone (Runway 17/35). The inner
edge of this approach zone is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands
outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000
feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the
centerline of the runway;
      (2)   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone (Runways 03/21 And 12/30). The
inner edge of this approach zone is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands
outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000
feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the
centerline of the runway;
      (3)   Transitional Zones. The areas beneath the transitional surfaces;
      (4)   Horizontal Zone. The Horizontal Zone is established by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of
Runway 17/35 and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those
arcs. The Horizontal Zone does not include the Approach and Transitional Zones;
and
      (5)   Conical Zone. The Conical Zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the Horizontal Zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
(Prior Code, § 12-603) (Ord. 02-01, passed 2-4-2002)
§ 152.04 HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be
erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any
zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height
limit herein established for such zone.
   (B)   Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of
the zones in question as follows:
      (1)   Utility Runway Nonprecision Approach Zone (Runway 17/35). Slopes 34
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline;
      (2)   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone (Runways 03/21 And 12/30).
Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline;
      (3)   Transitional Zones. Slopes seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 1,564 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending to where they intersect at the conical surface;
      (4)   Horizontal Zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation; and
      (5)   Conical Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.

152.99
§ 152.05 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
(Prior Code, § 12-605) (Ord. 02-01, passed 2-4-2002) Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.06 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of
a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date hereof, and is
diligently prosecuted. Existing structures fall under the existing ordinance.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Joint Airport Zoning
Board, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport
the presence of such airport obstructions. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Municipal Airport and
the city.
(Prior Code, § 12-606) (Ord. 02-01, passed 2-4-2002) Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.07 PERMITS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   Future uses.
      (1)   Except as specifically provided in divisions (A)(1)(a), (A)(1)(b),
and (A)(1)(c) below, no material change shall be made in the use of the land,
no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, no pond, lake, or
lagoon shall be constructed, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby
created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each
application for permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be
granted. No permit for use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
division (D) below.
         (a)   In the area lying within the limits of the Horizontal Zone and
Conical Zone and outside the Approach Zone and Transition Zone, no permit shall
be required for any structure or tree less than 75 feet of the vertical height
above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or
topographical features, such structure or tree would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
         (b)   In areas lying within the limits of the Approach Zones and
Transition Zones, but at a horizontal distance of no less than 4,200 feet from
each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any structure or tree
less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when such
structure or tree, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features,
would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
         (c)   In the areas lying within the limits of the Transition Zones, no
permit shall be required for any structure or tree less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such structure or tree, because
of terrain, land contour, or topographical features, would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such Transition Zones.
      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter except as set forth in §
152.04(B)(5) of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date hereof or any amendments thereto or than it is when the
application for permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such
permit shall be granted.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Joint Airport
Zoning Board determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or allow the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for a variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace.
Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal
application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary
hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will
not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be
in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for
variance to the requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Board of
Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Airport
Zoning Commission for advice as to the aeronautical effect of the variance. If
the Airport Zoning Commission does not respond to the application within 15
days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny
said application.
   (E)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in its circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner’s expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain the necessary markings and lights.

and permitted development of adjacent properties.
      (2)   An application for a special exception to use or develop property
as specifically authorized in district use regulations or in this section, may
be filed by any person owning the affected property or by any tenant upon
written authorization of the owner. Such application shall be filed with the
Board, and a copy thereof with the enforcing officer. Such application shall
show the location and intended use of the site, the names of all the property
owners and existing land uses within 300 feet, and any other material pertinent
to the request which the Board of Adjustment may require.
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment shall hold one or more public hearings
thereon in accordance with the requirements for notice and hearings. Any appeal
or application may be withdrawn upon written notice to the enforcing officer
but no appeal shall be withdrawn after posting of hearing notice and prior to
Board action thereon without formal consent of the Board.
   (C)   Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances
from the terms of this chapter, other than as to use, as will not be contrary
to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in any individual case,
result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed, and substantial justice done. Such variances may be granted in such
individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Board of
Adjustment that:
      (1)   There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to
the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or
topography;
      (2)   The application of this chapter to this particular piece of
property would create an unnecessary hardship, not self-imposed by the owner or
developer;
      (3)   Such conditions are peculiar only to the particular piece of
property involved; or
      (4)   Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the
public good or impair the purposes and intent of this zoning ordinance or the
comprehensive plan; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a
use of land, or buildings or structure that is prohibited by this chapter.
   (D)   Extent of relief.
      (1)   In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of Adjustment,
in conformity with the provisions of 11 O.S. § 44-105, and the provisions of
this chapter, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly; or modify the order;
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end
shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
      (2)   Every decision of the Board shall be based upon findings of fact
and every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of proceedings. The
enumerated conditions required to exist on any matter upon which the Board is
authorized to pass under these regulations shall be construed as limitations on
the power of the Board to act. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
empower the Board to change the terms of these regulations, or to effect
changes in the zoning districts. The powers of the Board shall be so applied
that the terms of these regulations will be strictly enforced.
         (a)   Three votes required. The concurring vote of at least three
members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, and decision or determination of any such administrative officer,
or to decide in favor of the applicant, or to decide any matter upon which it
is required to pass under this chapter or to effect any variation in this
chapter.
            1.   A member shall disqualify himself or herself from voting
whenever he or she has a personal or monetary interest in the property under
appeal, or will be directly affected by the decision of the Board; and
            2.   A member may disqualify himself or herself from voting
whenever any applicant, or his or her agent, has sought to influence the
member’s vote on the appeal, other than in the public hearing.
         (b)   Approval of request.
            1.   In approving any request, the Board may designate such
conditions in connection therewith in order to secure substantially the
objectives of the regulation or provision to which such variance is granted to
provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the
zone in which such permit is granted.
            2.   When necessary, the Board may require guarantees, in such form
as it deems proper, to insure that conditions designated in connection
therewith are being or will be complied with. Where any condition under which a
request has been granted appears to have been violated, the Board may hold a
public hearing thereon to determine whether or not the permit theretofore
granted shall be terminated.
            3.   Upon approval of an application for special exception or of a
variance appeal, the applicant shall apply for occupancy or construction
permits within 30 days after the Board’s decision unless a greater time is
requested in the application and is authorized by the Board. Any approval may
be granted one emergency extension of 60 days on written request filed with the
Board before expiration of the original approval. Failure of the applicant to
apply for occupancy or construction permits within the authorized time period
shall void the right to secure such permits except upon the filing of a new
application or appeal.
         (c)   Denial of request. No appeal or application that has been denied
shall be further considered by the board under a subsequent request obtained by
filing new plans and obtaining of a new decision from the enforcing officer
unless:
            1.   The new plans materially change the nature of the request; or
            2.   The permitted development of other nearby property in the same
zone has been substantially altered or changed by a ruling of the Board so as
to support an allegation of changed conditions.
(Prior Code, § 12-123) (Ord. passed 12-1-1971)
§ 153.29 NOTICE AND HEARINGS.

by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city where the
property is located and by mailing written notice by the Clerk of the Board of
Adjustment to all owners of property within a 300-foot radius of the exterior

owners of property adjacent to the subject property. The notice shall be mailed
at least ten days prior to the hearing and shall contain the facts listed in
divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) above. The Board of Adjustment shall set forth
in a statement of policy what constitutes minor variances or exceptions,
subject to approval or amendment by the City Council.

petition shall be presented to the court within ten days after the filing of
the decision in the office of the Board of Adjustment.

less than ten days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ
shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may,
on application, on notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant a
restraining order.
(Prior Code, § 12-126) (Ord. passed 12-1-1971)
§ 153.32 TESTIMONY AND ADJUDICATION.

necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or
appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to
the court with his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall
constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban
development. The arrangement of land parcels in the community for residential,
commercial, and industrial uses and for streets, alleys, schools, parks, and
other public purposes, will determine to a large degree the conditions of
health, safety, economy, and amenity that prevail in the urban area. The
quality of these conditions is of public interest. These regulations and
standards for the subdivision and improvement of land for urban use are to make
provision for adequate light, air, open spaces, drainage, transportation,
public utilities, and other needs, to insure the development and maintenance of
a healthy, attractive, and efficient community that provides for the
conservation and protection of its human and natural resources.
   (B)   These regulations are designed, intended, and should be administered
in a manner to:
      (1)   Implement the general plan;
      (2)   Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of
slums and blight;
      (3)   Harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land
to the existing community and facilitate the future development of adjoining
tracts;
      (4)   Provide that the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the
tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the
tract, and that the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the whole
community to be borne by the community;
      (5)   Provide the best possible design for the tract;
      (6)   Reconcile any differences of interest; and
      (7)   Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 12-401)
Statutory reference:
   Powers to adopt subdivision regulations, 11 O.S. § 45-104
§ 154.002 AUTHORITY.

or disapprove the plat within 30 days of the date of its submittal. If the
final plat is approved with the modification or waiver of certain requirements,
the Planning Commission shall specify the reasons therefor. If the final plat
is disapproved, the grounds for refusal, including citation of the applicable
regulations or general plan, shall be stated on the records of the Planning
Commission. If the Planning Commission fails to act, a certificate by the City

the date of action, over the signature of the Chairperson, Vice Chairperson, or
Secretary.
   (D)   The Planning Commission shall transmit to the City Council the tracing

for approval and for acceptance of public ways, service and utility easements,
and land dedicated to public use. This approval of the plat is shown over the
signature of the Mayor and attested to by the City Clerk or his or her Deputy.
The disapproval of any plat by the City Council is deemed a refusal of the
proposed dedication shown thereon.
   (H)   After final approval of the plat and the affixing of all required
signatures on the original tracing, the subdivider shall provide the Planning
Commission with two dark line prints thereof and one contact reproducible cloth
tracing, the tracing to be filed with the City Clerk. One dark line print is
retained in the permanent file of the Planning Commission and one is sent to
the office of the City Clerk. The applicant shall file, within six months after
the date of approval by the City Council, the original tracing, one dark line
copy on lineback, and one contact reproducible cloth tracing or film with the
City Clerk.
   (I)   Council approval of any final plat is conditioned upon the completion
of the subdivision in conformance with the standards and requirements in the
final plat. If the completed subdivision does not meet the plat requirements,
the Council may withdraw its approval and direct the Clerk to file appropriate
notice of the withdrawal with the County Clerk.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 155.060 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures
which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future
amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses
are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this chapter.

structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (A)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases

nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
   (D)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months, the
structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located; and
   (E)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.

would generate traffic or create congestion on the neighborhood streets other
than the normal traffic which serves the multi-family dwellings or similar
residential uses in this district and discourage any use which, because of its

services which would be in excess of such requirements and costs if the
district were developed solely for multi-family or other similar residential
uses.
