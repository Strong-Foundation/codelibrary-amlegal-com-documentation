CODE CONSTRUCTION
§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   Upon the adoption by the Council, this city code is hereby declared to be
and shall hereafter constitute the official city code. This city code of
ordinances shall be known and cited as the “Plentywood City Code” and is hereby
published by authority of the Council and shall be supplemented to incorporate
the most recent legislation of the city, as provided in §
10.20. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be
understood to refer to the position of the same number, its appropriate chapter
and title heading and to the general penalty clause relating thereto, as well
as to the section itself, when reference is made to this city code by title in
any legal documents.
(Prior Code, § 1-1-1)
§ 10.02 ACCEPTANCE.
   The city code, as hereby presented in printed form, shall hereafter be
received without further proof in all courts and in administrative tribunals of
this state as the ordinances of the city of general and permanent effect,
except the excluded ordinances enumerated in §
10.15.
(Prior Code, § 1-1-2)
§ 10.03 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.04 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto re-enacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if
it had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws re-enacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and re-enacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section unless otherwise provided.
§ 10.06 CATCHLINES.
   The catchlines of the several sections of the city code are intended as mere
catchwords to indicate the content of the section and shall not be deemed or
taken to be titles of such sections, nor be deemed to govern, limit, modify or
in any manner affect the scope, meaning or intent of the provisions of any
division or section hereof, nor unless expressly so provided, shall they be so
deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or re-
enacted.
(Prior Code, § 1-3-3)
§ 10.07 CONSTRUCTION OF WORDS.
   (A)   (1)   Whenever any word in any section of this city code importing the
plural number is used in describing or referring to any matters, parties or
persons, any single matter, party or person shall be deemed to be included,
although distributive words may not have been used.
      (2)   When any subject matter, party or person is referred to in this
city code by words importing the singular number only, or a particular gender,
several matters, parties or persons and the opposite gender and bodies
corporate shall be deemed to be included; provided that these rules of
construction shall not be applied to any section of this city code which
contains any express provision excluding such construction or where the subject
matter or context may be repugnant thereto.
   (B)   The word “ordinance” contained in the ordinances of the city has been
changed in the content of this city code to “title”, “chapter”, “section” and/
or “division” or words of like import for organizational and clarification
purposes only. Such change to the city’s ordinances is not meant to amend
passage and effective dates of such original ordinances.

the error.
§ 10.13 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt

§ 10.14 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
§ 10.15 REPEAL OF GENERAL ORDINANCES.
   All general ordinances of the city passed prior to the adoption of this city
code are hereby repealed, except such as are included in this city code or are
by necessary implication herein reserved from repeal (subject to the saving
clauses contained in the following sections), and excluding the following
ordinances which are not hereby repealed: tax levy ordinances; appropriation
ordinances; ordinances relating to boundaries and annexations; franchise
ordinances and other ordinances granting special rights to persons or
corporations; contract ordinances and ordinances authorizing the execution of a
contract or the issuance of warrants; salary ordinances; ordinances
establishing, naming or vacating streets, alleys or other public places;

ways, or relating to the conduct, duties, service or rates of public utilities,
shall be repealed by virtue of the adoption of this city code or by virtue of
the preceding section, except as the city code may contain provisions for such
matters, in which case, this city code shall be considered as amending such
ordinance or ordinances in respect to such provisions only.
(Prior Code, § 1-2-2)
§ 10.17 COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   Prior acts. No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a
former ordinance whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as
to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done,
any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or
claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any
such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceedings, so far as
practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be mitigated by any
provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the party
affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes
effect.
   (B)   Extend to all repeals. This section shall extend to all repeals,
either by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance
making any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   (C)   Currently pending actions. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general
ordinance of the city herein repealed, and the provisions of all general
ordinances contained in this code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions
and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this chapter be
deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or
to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the city under any ordinance or provision thereof in
force at the time of the adoption of this city code.
(Prior Code, § 1-2-3)
§ 10.18 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and re-enactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
§ 10.19 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature and all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not embraced in this code shall remain in full force and
effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.20 ORDINANCES WHICH AMEND OR SUPPLEMENT CODE.
   Any ordinance amending the city code shall set forth the title, chapter and
section number of the section or sections to be amended, and this shall
constitute sufficient compliance with any statutory requirement pertaining to
the amendment or revision by ordinance of any part of this city code. All such
amendments or revisions by ordinance shall be immediately forwarded to the
codifiers, and such ordinance material shall be prepared for insertion in its
proper place in each copy of this city code. Each such replacement page shall
be properly identified and shall be inserted in each individual copy of the
city code.
(Prior Code, § 1-1-3)
§ 10.21 CODE ALTERATIONS.
   It shall be deemed unlawful for any person to alter, change, replace or
deface in any way any section or any page of this city code in such a manner
that the meaning of any phrase or order may be changed or omitted. Replacement
pages may be inserted according to the official instructions when so authorized
by the Council. The City Clerk shall see that the replacement pages are
properly inserted in the official copies maintained in the office of the Clerk.
Any person having custody of a copy of the city code shall make every effort to
maintain said code current as to the most recent ordinances passed. Such person
shall see to the immediate insertion of new or replacement pages when such are
delivered or made available to such person through the office of the City
Clerk. Such code books, while in actual possession of officials and other
interested persons, shall be and remain the property of the city and shall be
returned to the office of the City Clerk when directed so to do by order of the
Council.
(Prior Code, § 1-1-4)
§ 10.22 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and amending ordinances, if any, are listed
following the text of the code section. Example:
      (Ord. 10, passed 5-13-1960; Ord. 15, passed 1-1-1970; Ord. 20, passed 1-
1-1980; Ord. 25, passed 1-1-1985)
   (B)   (1)   If a statutory cite is included in the history, this indicates
that the text of the section reads substantially the same as the statute.
Example:
      (MC.A. § 36-5-2-2)
      (2)   If a statutory cite is set forth as a “statutory reference”
following the text of the section, this indicates that the reader should refer
to that statute for further information. Example:
         § 39.01 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.
            This city shall make available to any person for inspection or
copying all public records unless otherwise exempted by state law.
         Statutory reference:
            Inspection of public records, see MCA § 11-1102
   (C)   If a section of this code is derived from the previous code of
ordinances of the city published in a previous year and subsequently amended,

Code, §      )”.
§ 10.23 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred
or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The liabilities,
proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or forfeitures
shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted. In
particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-way;
contracts entered into or franchises granted; the acceptance, establishment or
vacation of any highway; and the election of corporate officers shall remain
valid in all respects, as if this code had not been enacted.
OFFENSES AND GENERAL PENALTY
§ 10.35 MUNICIPAL INFRACTIONS OR CIVIL OFFENSES.
   (A)   Definition. A MUNICIPAL INFRACTION is a civil offense punishable by a
civil penalty of not more than $300 for each violation or, if the infraction is
a second or subsequent offense, a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each
such repeat offense.
   (B)   Issuance of citation. Citations for civil infractions shall be issued
and signed by the City Attorney, city employees designated or authorized by the
City Council to perform animal control duties or by a sworn peace office of the
state, or the City Fire Chief as the authorized Fire Code Official. The person
or party against whom a citation for a civil infraction is issued shall be
known as the defendant and the city shall be the plaintiff. Each day that a
violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the defendant constitutes a
separate infraction.
   (C)   Service of citation. The citation may be served by personal service;
by certified mail addressed to the defendant at the defendant’s last known
mailing address, return receipt requested; or by publication as provided in
Rule 4D(4) of the Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure. A
copy of the citation shall be retained by the person issuing the citation and
one copy shall be sent or delivered to the city court.
   (D)   Contents of citation. The citation serves as notification that a
municipal infraction has been committed and shall contain the following
information:
      (1)   The name and address of the defendant;
      (2)   The name or description of the infraction attested to by the
officer or person issuing the citation;
      (3)   The location and time of the infraction;
      (4)   The amount of civil penalty to be assessed or the alternate relief
sought, or both;
      (5)   The manner, location and time in which the penalty may be paid;
      (6)   The time and place of court appearance;
      (7)   The penalty for failure to appear in court; and
      (8)   Any other information required by law or this code.
   (E)   Jurisdiction of city court. Citations for civil offenses or municipal
infractions shall be tried in the city court by the City Court Judge in the
same manner as a “small claims” matter; provided that the total dollar amount
of civil penalties to be assessed does not exceed any jurisdictional dollar
limit for cases of municipal infractions or civil offenses placed by law upon
the city court. If the total amount of civil penalties to be assessed exceeds
such jurisdictional limit, then the matter shall be tried before a judge in the
district court as provided by law. All references herein to the COURT shall
mean the city court, except in those instances where the case is originally
tried in district court due to the amount at issue being in excess of the city
court’s jurisdictional dollar limit.
   (F)   Burden of proof. The city has the burden of proof that the municipal
infraction occurred and that the defendant committed the infraction. The proof
must be by clear and convincing evidence.
   (G)   Conduct of proceedings. As provided by the state statutes, in
municipal infraction proceedings, the matter must be tried before the City
Court Judge in the same manner as a small claim if the total amount of civil
penalties does not exceed $3,000. The matter may only be tried before a judge
in district court if the total amount of civil penalties assessed exceeds
$3,000. Jury trials shall be conducted in the manner provided by law for jury
trials in city courts. The court shall ensure that the defendant has received a
copy of the charges and that the defendant understands the charges. The
defendant may question all witnesses who appear for the city and may produce
evidence or witnesses on the defendant’s behalf. The defendant may be
represented by counsel of the defendant’s own choosing and at the defendant’s
own expense. The defendant may answer by admitting or denying the infraction.
   (H)   Disposition. If a municipal infraction is proven, the court shall
enter a judgment against the defendant. If the infraction is not proven, the
court shall dismiss the citation. If the defendant named in the citation is
served, as provided above, and fails without good cause to appear in response
to the civil citation, judgment shall be entered against the defendant.
   (I)   Penalties and forfeitures. All penalties or forfeitures collected by
the court for municipal infractions shall be remitted to the city in the same
manner as fines and forfeitures collected for criminal offenses.
   (J)   Court costs. A person against whom judgment is entered shall pay court
costs and fees as provided under state law for small claims court actions. If
the citation is dismissed by the court, the city shall be liable for court
costs and fees.
   (K)   Alternative relief. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized herein does
not preclude the city from seeking alternative relief from the court in the
same action.
   (L)   Judgment. When judgment is entered against a defendant, the court may
do any of the following:
      (1)   Impose a civil penalty by entry of a judgment against the
defendant;
      (2)   Direct that payment of the civil penalty be suspended or deferred
under conditions imposed by the court;
      (3)   Grant appropriate alternative relief ordering the defendant to
abate or cease the violation;
      (4)   Authorize the city to abate or correct the violation;
      (5)   Order that the city’s costs for abatement or correction of the
violation be entered as a judgment against the defendant or assessed against
the property where the violation occurred, or both; or
      (6)   Any other condition or form of relief authorized by law.
   (M)   Violation. If a defendant willfully violates the terms of an order
imposed by the court, such violation or failure to comply is contempt.
   (N)   Costs of abatement or correction. The City Court Judge has
jurisdiction to assess or enter judgment for costs of abatement or correction
in any amount not to exceed the jurisdictional dollar amount for a money
judgment in a civil action brought in city courts in the state, as provided by
law, under MCA § 3-11-103 or successor statutes. If the city seeks abatement or
correction costs in excess of such jurisdictional amount, the matter must be
referred to the district court, where such matter shall be heard and determined
as provided by law.
   (O)   New trials and appeals. The defendant or the city may file a motion
for a new trial or may appeal the decision to district court. A factual
determination made by the trial court, supported by substantial evidence as
shown in the record, is binding for purposes of appeal relating to the
violation at issue but is not admissible or binding as to any future violations
for the same or similar code provision by the same defendant.
   (P)   Basis for other actions.
      (1)   Except for willful or wanton misconduct on the part of the city,
the issuance of a civil citation for a municipal infraction or the ensuing
court proceedings shall not provide an action for false arrest, false
imprisonment or malicious prosecution.
      (2)   In addition to the foregoing, the city and its agents or officers

CHAPTER 35: FINANCE AND REVENUE
Section
   
35.01   Special Improvement District Revolving Fund
§ 35.01 SPECIAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT REVOLVING FUND.
   (A)   Created. There hereby is created a special improvement district
revolving fund in order to, and for the purpose of, securing prompt payment of
any and all special improvement district bonds and/or warrants of all special
improvement districts of the city, created subsequent to February 25, 1929, in
compliance with Title 1, Local Government, of the Montana Code Annotated. Any
such existing fund created heretofore is hereby reaffirmed, recreated and
ratified.
   (B)   Powers of Council. For the purpose of providing funds for such
Revolving Fund, the City Council:
      (1)   May, in its discretion, from time to time, transfer to the
Revolving Fund from the General Fund of the city such amount as may be deemed
necessary, which amount so transferred shall be deemed and considered, and
shall be loans from such General Fund to the Revolving Fund; and
      (2)   Shall, in addition to such transfer from the General Fund, or in
lieu thereof, levy and collect for such Revolving Fund such a tax, hereby
declared to be for a public purpose, on all the taxable property in the city as
shall be necessary to meet the financial requirements of such fund. Such levy,
together with such transfer, shall not exceed in any one year 5% of the
principal amount of the then outstanding special improvement district bonds and
warrants.
   (C)   Insufficient funds. Whenever any special improvement district bond or
warrant, or any interest thereon, shall be, at the time of the passage hereof,
or shall thereafter become due and payable, and there shall then be either no
money or not sufficient money in the appropriate district fund with which to
pay the same, an amount sufficient to make up the deficiency may, by order of
the City Council, be loaned by the Revolving Fund to such district fund, and
thereupon such bond or warrant or such interest thereon, or in case of such
bonds or warrants due at the time of the passage hereof, such part of the
amount due on such bonds or warrants, whether it be for principal or interest,
or both, as the Council may, in its discretion, elect or determine, shall be
paid from the money so loaned or from the monies so loaned when added to such
insufficient amount, as the case may require; provided, however, that none of
the provisions of this section shall apply to any district created prior to
February 25, 1929.
   (D)   Loans. Whenever any loan is made to any Special Improvement District
Fund from the Revolving Fund, the Revolving Fund shall have a lien therefor on
all unpaid assessments and installments of assessments on such district,
whether delinquent or not, and on all monies thereafter coming into such
district, to the amount of such loan, together with interest thereon from the
time it was made at the rate, or percentage, borne by the bond or warrant for
payment of which, or, of interest thereon, such loan was made; and whenever
there shall be monies in such District Fund which are not required for payment
of any bond or warrant of such district, or interest thereon, so much of such
monies as may be necessary to pay such loan shall, by order of the Council, be
transferred to the Revolving Fund; and after the bonds and warrants issued on
any special improvement district have been fully paid, all monies remaining in
such district fund shall, by order of the Council, be transferred to and become
part of the Revolving Fund.
   (E)   Excess funds.
      (1)   Whenever there is, in the Revolving Fund, an amount in excess of
the amount which the Council deems necessary for payment or redemption of
maturing bonds or warrants or interest thereon, the Council may:
         (a)   By vote of its members at a meeting called for that purpose,
order such excess or any part thereof transferred to the General Fund; or
         (b)   Use such excess or any part thereof for the purpose of
purchasing property at sales for delinquent taxes or assessments, or both, or
which may have been struck off or sold to the county for delinquent taxes or
assessments, or both, and against which property there then is any unpaid
assessment for special improvements on account whereof there are outstanding
special improvement district bonds or warrants of the city.
      (2)   The Council may sell any tax certificates issued on any such sale.
After acquiring title to such property, the city may lease such property or
sell the same at public or private sale and make conveyance thereof, or
otherwise dispose thereof as the interest of the city may require. All proceeds
from such sale of tax certificates and from such leasing, sale or other
disposition of the property shall belong to, and be paid into, the Revolving
Fund and be subject to transfer, in whole or in part, to the General Fund by
the vote of all the members of the Council at a meeting called for that purpose
as hereinbefore provided.

UTILITY ACCOUNTS AND SERVICES
§ 50.01 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT.
   All rates or assessments for utility services (water, sewer and/or garbage)
shall be charged against the property served and against the owner thereof,
regardless of whether or not the property is occupied by the owner at the time
such services are provided. By special agreement with the city, when property
is being rented or occupied by someone other than the owner, the utility bill
may be sent to such renter or occupant. However, in all instances, (even when
by agreement the renter or occupant receives the bill) the owner shall remain
fully liable for all utility charges for all times, including, without
limitation, when the renter or occupant fails to pay the utility bill, or any
part thereof regarding a period when the property was rented to a tenant or
occupied by someone other than the owner. In the event any utility services are
discontinued for failure to pay for them, such services will not be reinstated
for such property regardless of a change in ownership or occupancy, until all
delinquent amounts are paid in full. Multiple owners of property shall be
considered jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the utility
charges for services provided to their property during their ownership.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-1)
§ 50.02 PAYMENT DEADLINE.
   Charges for sewer, water and garbage services shall be due and payable on
the fifteenth day of the month immediately following the month in which such
charges are determined and the bill for such charges is mailed out.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-2) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.03 LATE PAYMENT FEE.
   A late payment fee shall be imposed on an account that is not paid in full
by the due date. The late payment fee may be imposed for delinquent sewer,
water and/or garbage services, or previously imposed late payment fees.
Additional late payment fees shall be imposed each month to any delinquent
amount until it is paid in full. The late payment fee shall be in an amount set
by the Council.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-3)
§ 50.04 DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SERVICE.
   Water services to premises shall be discontinued when the account has an
outstanding balance for charges for water or sewer services that has existed
for one month or more beyond the due date unless prior to the deadline set for
payment all past due charges for such services are paid in full. As used in the
foregoing sentence, CHARGES shall include the amount billed for water or sewer
services along with any late payment fees regarding charges for such services.
All discontinuances or shutoffs shall be done pursuant to orders made and
issued by the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-4)
§ 50.05 PROCEDURE FOR DISCONTINUANCE.
   (A)   Notice to disconnect. Prior to the discontinuance of water services,
there shall be provided to the delinquent account customer a written or printed
notice stating the intention to discontinue water services for such
delinquency. Such notice shall be given at least five business days (days other
than Saturday, Sunday and those days recognized by the city as holidays) in
advance of the time at which such services are to be discontinued.
   (B)   Service of notice.
      (1)   Personal service. The notice shall be personally or hand delivered
to the person in whose name the account is listed on the records of the city,
or one of the persons in whose names the account is so listed if it is listed

name of an entity or organization, then such notice shall be delivered
personally to a person at least 18 years of age who is reasonably believed to
be an agent of such entity or authorized to receive such notice.
      (3)   Account holder or agent unavailable. If no such account holder or
agent is found on the premises, the notice shall be given to a responsible
adult member of the household, if applicable, or other responsible adult on the
premises.
      (4)   Placement in conspicuous location. In lieu of personal service, the
said notice may be placed at a conspicuous location on the premises whose
account is delinquent.
      (5)   Service by mail. In those instances where personal service or
placement of the notice on the property would not be practical or the notice
would not likely reach the owner, then service may, as an alternative, be made
by mail addressed to the last known address of the account holder or owner of
the premises.
      (6)   When deemed served. The notice shall be deemed served when it is
personally delivered, placed at a conspicuous location on the said premises or
mailed.
   (C)   Contents of notice. The notice shall state that, in the event the
customer desires to appeal the order to discontinue services, dispute the
amount owed on the bill or otherwise contest on any ground the delinquency and/
or the proposed shutoff, then the customer may do so by contacting the City
Clerk’s office and filing an appeal of such order. Such notice shall give the
telephone number and address of the City Clerk’s office along with the office
hours of the Clerk. The customer shall have five business days, as defined
above, from the date of the service of the notice (not counting the day of
service of the notice) in which to file such an appeal of the order and the
notice shall so state.
   (D)   Hours turnoff permitted. Water shall be discontinued for delinquency
in payment only between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on Mondays,
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Water shall not be discontinued on holidays
recognized by the city or days that are immediately followed by any holiday.
   (E)   Remedy prior to shutoff. Water services will not be discontinued for
the premises receiving a shutoff notice if, prior to the time when
discontinuance of service is scheduled, the customer pays all past due amounts
owed for water service, sewer service and/or late payment fees for such
services.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-5)
§ 50.06 CONDITIONS FOR RE-ESTABLISHMENT.
   In the event water service to any premises has been discontinued for a
delinquent account as provided herein, such service will be re-established upon
payment of all past due amounts owed for water service, sewer service and/or
late payment fees for such services.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-6)
§ 50.07 APPEALS.
   (A)   Stay of discontinuance. Upon the filing of an appeal of an order of
discontinuance of services, there shall be no shutoff or discontinuance of
services pending the appeal.
   (B)   Hearing scheduled. Upon the filing of an appeal, the Clerk shall
forthwith notify the Mayor of such filing and the Mayor shall set the matter
for hearing. All hearings of such appeals shall be before the City Council at
either a regular or special meeting.
   (C)   Notice of hearing. Written notice of the hearing date, time and place
shall be provided to the customer at least three business days prior to the
hearing date. Such notice shall be deemed to be sufficient if it is mailed to

day it is mailed, prior to the date of hearing.
   (D)   Hearing. The Council, at the hearing, shall follow the ordinary and
applicable procedures and rules regarding its deliberations, voting and
actions. In the event the Council upholds or affirms its original order to
discontinue services, the Council shall cause to be served upon the customer a
notice of intent to discontinue service and such notice shall be delivered to
the customer or the affected premises in accordance with the procedures set
forth in §
50.05, or the notice may be served upon the customer at such hearing after the
Council has duly considered and acted upon the appeal.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-7)
§ 50.08 REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OR MODIFICATION.
   (A)   A customer may request, for reasons of hardship or other special
circumstances, an extension of a due date for the payment of accrued or
delinquent utility charges for water, sewer and/or garbage services, or other
modification of or exception to the terms and conditions under which such
services are provided.
   (B)   All such requests must be made to the City Council, either orally or
in writing. On the basis of proven hardship or special circumstances, it is
within the discretion of the Council to grant a modification of or exception to
such terms and conditions. The consideration of and action upon such request
shall be done in accordance with the ordinary procedures and rules regarding
Council action.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-8)
§ 50.09 SHUTOFF VALVE.
   (A)   Required. Premises receiving city water service shall have a shutoff
valve located on the water service line between the water main and the meter so
that the supply of water to the premises can be shut off and turned on. Where
water services to premises have been discontinued due to the demolition,
vacancy or removal of the serviced structure or other reason, an operable
shutoff valve in good repair shall be located on the water service line as long
as the line is connected to the city main.
   (B)   Maintenance. The shutoff valve and box shall be kept in good repair
and operable condition, at all times, by the owner of the premises and any
occupant thereof.

city to be inoperable, leaking or otherwise in need of replacement or repair,
the city shall provide the account holder or the owner of the premises with a
notice requiring that the shutoff valve be repaired or replaced within 30 days
of the date of the mailing of the notice.
      (2)   Failure to comply. If the repair or replacement is not made within
such time, the city may repair or replace the valve and the cost of such repair
or placement shall be billed to the owner or added to the account for the
affected premises.
      (3)   Access. Shutoff valves shall be placed and maintained in a location
that is easily accessible by city personnel. The owner, tenant or occupant
shall not cause access by city personnel to the shutoff valve to be obstructed
or prevented by any means whatsoever. Such obstructions shall be immediately
removed upon the request by the city to do so. In the event that the city
personnel’s immediate access to a shutoff valve is denied or obstructed for any
reason, the city personnel may remove any such obstructions. Any costs or
expenses incurred by the city as the result of the removal of such obstructions
may be added to the account for the premises involved.

   (A)   Discontinuance of service. Garbage collection service to premises may

services, along with any late payment fees regarding charges for such services.
All discontinuances or shutoffs of garbage services shall be done pursuant to
orders made and issued by the City Council.

the owner or occupant of the affected premises shall be given a written or
printed notice stating the intention of the city to terminate garbage services
unless payment of all past due amounts for such services is made by a certain
date. The procedures for service of the notice and the rights of appeal shall
be the same as that provided above for the discontinuance of water service. The
notice shall be provided at least five business days prior to any
discontinuance of service. The termination of garbage services will coincide
with a day on which the garbage would have otherwise been collected but for the
discontinuance.

contamination to the city’s system, or property damage or personal injury to
any party.
(Prior Code, § 9-4-15)
PROCEDURE FOR UNPAID CHARGES
§ 50.30 GENERAL STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   This subchapter authorizes a procedure for levying an assessment and lien
upon real property to collect unpaid charges and penalties for city utility
services. This assessment procedure is in addition to the authority of the city
to bring suit in city court or any other court of competent jurisdiction to
collect arrearages on accounts for utility services as any other debt owed to
the city.
(Ord. 21-031918, passed 3-19-2018)
§ 50.31 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CITY. The City of Plentywood, Sheridan County, Montana.
   OWNER. Unless otherwise indicated, an OWNER is a person, party or entity
having a legal ownership interest in real property based upon the records or
information in the office of the County Clerk and Recorder along with records
or files in other offices of the county or the state. The word OWNER includes
ownership by a single party, person or entity, or ownership by multiple
parties, persons or entities. For pending contracts for deed not declared on
public record to be in default, the purchasing party or buyer shall be regarded
as the OWNER. Where property has been repossessed or foreclosed upon by a
seller or lender, the seller or lender is regarded as the OWNER. When property
is held in trust, according to the records of the county or the state, the
trustee is regarded as the OWNER or responsible party and the party to whom
notice should be directed. If the OWNER of property is deceased, incompetent or
the subject of a conservatorship or guardianship proceedings, the owner’s
personal representative, guardian, conservator or other acting fiduciary,
according to public records of the county or the state, will be regarded as the
OWNER or responsible party and the one to whom notice will be given.
   PENALTIES FOR DELINQUENT UTILITY CHARGES. The term PENALTIES, when referring
to delinquent utility bills, includes any additional charge imposed or incurred
as the result of not paying for utilities by the due date such as “late” fees
or charges.
   UTILITY or UTILITIES. Water, sewer and/or garbage collection services, or
any of them, provided or furnished by the city.
(Ord. 21-031918, passed 3-19-2018)
§ 50.32 NOTICE OF DEADLINE FOR PAYMENT.
   (A)   Each year by the end of June, the City Clerk shall prepare a list of
delinquent utility accounts on which a substantial past-due amount is owed to
the city for services furnished before the end of June of that year.
Thereafter, for such listed accounts, the City Treasurer, no later than July 7,
shall give written notice to the owner of the lot, parcel or real property to
which such utilities have been provided or that were served by city utilities.
   (B)   The notice shall contain the following:
      (1)   Name of the owner of the lot, parcel or real property;

      (3)   Legal description of the lot, parcel or real property;
      (4)   Utility services provided;
      (5)   Amount owed for utilities and penalties, such as late fees;
      (6)   Warning that if the delinquent utility charges and penalties are
not paid within 30 days of the date of the notice, the said unpaid amounts will
be levied as an assessment and lien against the lot, parcel or real property;
and
      (7)   A statement that the city may also collect past-due utility charges
and penalties as a debt owed to the city by bringing suit in city court or any
other court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 50.33 RESOLUTION FOR ASSESSMENT AND LIEN.
   (A)   (1)   The City Clerk shall prepare and present to the Council a
resolution listing those accounts that have not been paid by the deadline set
in the notice provided by the City Treasurer.
      (2)   This resolution shall contain the following:
         (a)   Name of the owner of the property to which utility services were

         (e)   Amount of utility charges and penalties, such as late fees, to
be assessed.
   (B)   Upon the passage of the resolution, the delinquent utility charges,
together with any penalties, shall constitute a special assessment and lien
that is thereby levied upon the property served with utilities or provided with
utility services. A copy of the adopted resolution shall be forwarded to the
county and/or state officials or personnel responsible for assessments, levies
and collections as with other such similar taxes and assessments. The adopted
resolution shall constitute a certification by the city that the information
contained in such resolution is true and correct according to the city’s files
and records. The said officials of the Department of Revenue and/or other
involved county or state offices shall impose the amount of delinquent charges,
along with any penalties, as a tax against the lot, parcel or real estate,
which is to be assessed for the delinquent or unpaid utility charges and
penalties. The city shall have the right to enforce or foreclose upon such
assessment and lien so levied in the resolution with the same remedies, such as
the sale of the premises, available under state law for the enforcement or
foreclosure of any other such similar or like tax or assessment lien.
Immediately after the passage of such resolution, a copy shall be mailed to the
owner of the real property that is subject to the assessment by the resolution.
(Ord. 21-031918, passed 3-19-2018)

assessments, levies or other actions provided or taken herein for the
collection of delinquent utility accounts can appeal the same for hearing by
the City Council. A person wishing to have a hearing shall file a signed
written notice of appeal with the City Clerk with a detailed description of the

to or adoption by the City Council of the resolution levying an assessment and
lien upon real property, or other actions or proceedings taken with regards to
such resolution, assessment or lien. An administrative or judicial appeal does
not waive or excuse the obligation to pay the full amount of the delinquent
charges, including penalties or late fees, within the 30 days provided in the
notice by the City Treasurer. Any payment of delinquent utility charges, along
with penalties or late fees, must be designated as “paid under protest” if made
while an appeal is pending or planned, and prior to the final resolution of the
appeal. If the delinquency is not paid within the 30 days, as required by the
Treasurer’s notice, the appeal will not be considered effective, perfected or
valid. All delinquent charges and penalties paid “under protest” during a
pending appeal shall be credited to the delinquent account and subject to
refund if the appeal is eventually resolved in favor of the appellant after any
administrative or judicial proceedings. For payments made “under protest”,
legal actions challenging such payment or its validity and seeking to recover
such payment must be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction no later than
30 days from the date of the mailing of the Council’s decision following a
hearing.
   (C)   After the appeal is filed, the Mayor shall set a hearing before the
Council. The person filing the appeal shall be notified of the hearing and
given an opportunity to appear and be heard. The hearing’s format and
procedures shall be set by the Mayor and Council. The Council’s deliberation
and action shall be done by voting. The Mayor is the presiding officer and may
vote to break ties. Hearing decisions may be orally announced, or taken under
advisement. Decisions must be written and a copy mailed to the owner filing the
appeal within 30 days after the hearing, not including weekends and holidays.
The mailing of the decision is deemed the final administrative action.

created, be apprehended or taken into custody by a city employee, pending

along with a description of the dog.
   (E)   Redemption by owner; fees. The owner of any dog so impounded may
reclaim such dog upon proof of compliance with the licensing provisions of this

dog. If the dog is not licensed, the person to whom the dog is given must pay
for the license fees and provide necessary proof of rabies vaccination.

(Ord. 18-041717, passed 4-17-2017) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 91.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   NUISANCE CONDITIONS.
      (1)   Includes as follows:
         (a)   Open presence of personal property that is (or reasonably
appears to be) junk, waste, debris, garbage, refuse, trash or rubbish of any
source, origin, design, kind, composition or substance;
         (b)   Dwellings, businesses, accessory structures or any other
buildings or structures that are in public view and damaged (or partly or
totally destroyed) by fire and remain unrepaired or unrestored, and without the
removal of the damaged or destroyed portions, for six months or more from the
date of the fire causing such damage or destruction; or
         (c)   Any objects, articles, conditions or personal property
encroaching upon or interfering with the movement of traffic or vehicles, or
access, in an alley or publicly dedicated right-of-way that serves as an alley.
      (2)   The following are exclusions from this definition.
         (a)   The term NUISANCE CONDITIONS does not apply to construction,
demolition or landscaping projects in progress as long as the work is in the
process of being diligently and expeditiously performed in a continuous manner
with completion likely within a reasonable period of time. The city reserves
the right to specify a time limitation or deadline for the completion of any
project.
         (b)   The term NUISANCE CONDITIONS does not apply to or include
vehicles subject to special disposition or handling under state statutes:
            1.   Removal and sale of abandoned motor vehicles in MCA Title 61,
Chapter 12, Part 4; or
            2.   Motor vehicle recycling and disposal in MCA Title 75, Chapter
10, Part 5.
   OPEN. The presence of nuisance conditions is OPEN when the nuisance
conditions are visible or subject to view from outside the boundaries of the
property where they are located. Nuisance conditions are not considered to be
in OPEN presence when they are stored inside a permanent enclosed structure or
building with walls and a roof, such as an accessory building, commercial
structure or dwelling that has been permitted as a building or structure under
the City Zoning Code incorporated in chapter 153. Nuisance conditions are
considered to be in OPEN presence when they are covered or hidden or attempted
to be so by fences, screens, tents, tarps, canvas or any other materials that
serve as a visual barrier but are not permitted buildings or structures
described above.
   OWNER. A person, party or entity having a legal ownership interest in the
real property in question based upon the records or information in the office
of the County Clerk and Recorder or other records or information filed or
recorded in the public offices of the county. The word OWNER is intended to
include ownership by a single party, person or entity; or ownership by multiple
parties, persons or entities. In the case of a pending contract for deed that
is not declared on record to be in default, the purchasing party or buyer shall
be regarded as the owner. Where property has been repossessed or foreclosed
upon by a seller or lender, the seller or lender shall be regarded as the
OWNER. In the case of property held in trust according to the records of the
County Clerk and Recorder, the trustee shall be regarded as the owner or
responsible party and the one to whom notice of nuisance conditions will be
directed. If the owner of property is deceased, incompetent or the subject of a
conservatorship or guardianship proceedings, the owner’s personal
representative, guardian, conservator or other acting fiduciary, according to
public records or filings of the county, will be regarded as the OWNER or
responsible party and the one to whom notice of nuisance conditions will be
given.
   PRESENCE. The existence, accumulation, placement or storage of objects or
articles constituting nuisance conditions.
   PUBLIC VIEW. Visible or subject to view outside the boundaries of the
property where they are located.
   RENTED OR LEASED PREMISES. When premises are leased, rented or otherwise
occupied by persons or entities other than the owner, it is the duty of any
such renter, lessee or occupant, along with the owner, to prevent or eliminate
nuisance conditions on the rented, leased or occupied premises and the adjacent
areas described above.
(Ord. 18-041717, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 91.03 REPORTS OF NUISANCE CONDITIONS.
   (A)   All reports or complaints of nuisance conditions shall be directed to
and received by the City Clerk. Upon receiving a report, the Clerk shall cause
an investigation to be made of the real property that is the subject of the
report. Upon determining from the investigation that evidence of nuisance
conditions exist, the Clerk shall cause notice of such conditions to be given
to the owner. In addition to the notice to the owner, the Clerk may also
provide notice to any party, other than the owner, who is renting, leasing or
occupying the premises.
   (B)   The notice to the owner shall provide the following information:
      (1)   Name(s) of the owner(s);
      (2)   Street address of the real property that is the subject of the
notice;
      (3)   Legal description of the real property that is the subject of the
notice;
      (4)   Mailing address of the owner to whom notice is given;
      (5)   Brief description of the nuisance conditions;
      (6)   Warning that owner has 30 days from the date of the notice to
eliminate or remove the nuisance conditions; and
      (7)   Notice that, unless nuisance conditions are eliminated or removed
satisfactorily by the deadline, the city will clean up the nuisance conditions
and charge the clean-up cost, along with a specified administrative fee, to the
owner and, if not paid, the cost and fee will be levied as a special assessment
against the property as a lien and collected in the same manner as real estate
taxes.
   (C)   (1)   Notice of a violation shall be served by:
         (a)   Personal delivery to the owner; or
         (b)   First class mail through the United States Postal Service to the
last known address of the owner or the address shown in the real estate tax
records of the county.
      (2)   In case of multiple owners, the notice will be served personally or
mailed to the owner or person who the records of the county show as the
designated party to whom real property tax notices or other tax related
documents are sent or given. Notice is deemed given when deposited with the
United States Postal Service or personally delivered.
(Ord. 18-041717, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 91.04 FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   If the owner fails to comply with the request to remove or eliminate the
nuisance conditions by the deadline given in the notice, or in the event such
notice cannot be sent or delivered despite a reasonably diligent attempt to do
so, the city, through its employees or contracted personnel, shall have the
authority to enter the real property (and/or adjacent publicly dedicated real
property or right-of-way) containing such nuisance conditions and cause the
removal or elimination of the nuisance conditions. At its discretion, the city
may have such removal or elimination done by its own employees or may contract
for it to be performed by a person, business or party who is not otherwise
employed by the city. Such elimination and/or removal shall also include the
authority to dispose of nuisance items with no obligation to allow salvage
value or credit to anyone claiming the same.
(Ord. 18-041717, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 91.05 CHARGES FOR REMOVAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FEES.
   A bill for the removal of the nuisance conditions shall be sent to the
owner. The charges shall consist of the actual cost of removal plus an
administrative fee set by the Council. The costs of removal shall be based on
the amount charged by a contractor for the work or, in the case of city
employees, shall be based on the hourly wages of the city employees assigned to
do the work. The bill is due upon receipt by the owner. The owner of the real
property from which the nuisance conditions were removed (and/or adjacent to
the publicly dedicated real property or right-of-way from which the nuisance
conditions were removed) is personally liable for the costs of removal and the
administrative fee. Multiple owners of property are jointly and severally
liable for such costs and administrative fee. The city may pursue the
collection of such fee and costs through either judicial proceedings filed
against the owner in the city court (or in another appropriate court at the
option of the city) or through the levy and foreclosure of the special
assessment lien as described below, or both.
(Ord. 18-041717, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 91.06 ASSISTANCE OF COURT.
   When necessary for the enforcement of this subchapter, or the investigation
or removal of nuisance conditions, the city court or the judge thereof is
authorized to issue orders or warrants for the following:
   (A)   To permit entry or access to real property, and/or presence thereon,
for inspection where nuisance conditions reasonably appear to be present; or
   (B)   To permit entry or access to real property, and/or presence thereon,
for removal of nuisance conditions where such conditions reasonably appear to
be present.
(Ord. 18-041717, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 91.07 ASSESSMENT AND LIEN.
   At least once a year, the Clerk shall prepare and present to the City
Council a resolution containing a list of all unpaid accounts resulting from
the city’s elimination of nuisance conditions. Such resolution shall identify
the real property on or adjacent to which the nuisance conditions existed, the
names of all owners and the balance owing for the costs and administrative fee.
Upon passage of such resolution, the costs and administrative fee stated
therein shall constitute a special assessment and lien upon the affected
property. A copy of the resolution, after passage, shall be certified in the
same manner as other taxes and special assessments and forwarded to the county
or state officials or personnel responsible for the said assessment and its
levy and collection. The city shall have the right to enforce or foreclose such
lien with the same remedies, such as a sale of the premises, available under
state law for the enforcement or foreclosure of any other tax or assessment
lien. Immediately upon passage of such resolution, a copy thereof shall be
mailed to the owner of the real property that is subject to the assessment by
the resolution.
(Ord. 18-041717, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 91.08 APPEAL TO CITY COUNCIL.
   Any owners or other persons who believe they have been aggrieved by the
obligations, responsibilities, procedures, decisions, assessments or other
actions provided herein have the opportunity to appeal or challenge the same in
a hearing before the City Council. Any such person desiring such hearing shall
file a signed written notice of appeal with the City Clerk and provide a
written explanation of what actions are being appealed and the reasons for
appeal. A notice of appeal must be filed within 15 days (counting weekends and
holidays) from the date of the action being appealed. Following the receipt of
such notice, the Mayor shall schedule a hearing before the Council. The person
filing the appeal shall be notified of the date, time and place of the hearing
and given the opportunity to appear and have the appeal heard. The format and
procedures for the hearing shall be set by the Mayor and Council. After
conducting the hearing, the Council shall decide the issues presented and
render a written decision. A copy of the decision shall be mailed to the owner
filing the appeal. The Council’s decision shall be deemed a final
administrative decision.

§ 91.21 NUISANCE VEGETATION.
   (A)   Duty to cut. An owner of real property within the city shall not
allow, permit or cause any nuisance vegetation to exist in or upon such
property or upon such property’s adjacent boulevard, sidewalk and curb or to
the centerline of the said property’s adjacent alley. It is the duty of real
property owners within the city to cut and prevent all nuisance vegetation on
their real property along with the adjacent areas described above.
      (1)   “Nuisance vegetation” is grass or weeds in excess of 12 inches in
height.
      (2)   When premises are leased, rented or otherwise occupied by persons
or entities other than the owner, it is also the duty of any such renter,
lessee or occupant to cut or prevent nuisance vegetation on the rented, leased
or occupied premises and the described adjacent areas.
      (3)   An “owner” shall be a person, party or entity having a legally
recognized ownership interest in the real property in question based upon the
records of the County Clerk and Recorder. In the case of a pending contract for
deed that is not declared to be in default, the purchasing party shall be
regarded as the owner. Where property has been repossessed by a seller or
lender, the seller or lender shall be regarded as the owner. In the case of
property held in trust, the trustee shall be regarded as the owner. If the
owner of property is deceased, incompetent or the subject of a conservatorship
or guardianship, the owner’s personal representative, guardian, conservator or
other acting fiduciary shall be regarded as the owner.
   (B)   Reports of nuisance vegetation; notice.
      (1)   (a)   All reports or complaints of nuisance vegetation shall be
directed toward and received by the City Clerk. Upon receiving such a report or
complaint, the Clerk shall cause an investigation to be made of the real
property that is the subject of the report or complaint. Upon determining from
such investigation that nuisance vegetation exists, the Clerk shall cause to
given to the owner a notice of such violation. In addition to notice to the
owner, the Clerk may also provide such notice to any party, other than the
owner, who is renting, leasing or occupying the premises.
         (b)   The notice shall provide the following information:
            1.   The owner shall have ten days from the date of the notice to
cut or eliminate the nuisance vegetation; and
            2.   If the nuisance vegetation is not cut or eliminated by the
stated time, the city may cause the nuisance vegetation to be cut and that the
cost of such cutting, together with an administrative fee, will be charged
against the owner and levied against the property as a special assessment,
which will constitute a lien upon the property.
      (2)   (a)   Notice of a violation shall be served by:
            1.   Personal delivery; or
            2.   Sending it to the owner by first class mail through the United
States Postal Service to the last known address of the owner or the address as
shown on the tax rolls of the county.
         (b)   In case of multiple owners, the notice need only be served
personally or mailed to the owner or person whom the records of the county show
as the responsible party to whom tax notices or other tax-related documents are
to be sent or given. Notice shall be deemed given when deposited with the
United States Postal Service or when personally delivered.
   (C)   Failure to comply; city to cut vegetation. If the owner fails to
comply with the request to eliminate nuisance vegetation by the deadline given
in the notice, or in the event that such notice cannot be sent or delivered for
whatever reason despite a diligent attempt to do so, the city shall have the
right to enter the real property containing such nuisance vegetation and cause
the cutting of the same. The city may have such work done by its own personnel
or may contract for it to be performed by a party who is not otherwise employed
by the city.
   (D)   Charges for work. A bill for the removal of the nuisance vegetation
shall be sent to the owner. The charges shall consist of the actual cost of
removal plus an administrative fee, which shall be set by the Council. The bill
shall be due upon receipt. The owner of the real property on or adjacent to
which the nuisance vegetation was removed shall be personally liable for the
costs and administrative fee. Multiple owners of property shall be jointly and
severally liable for such charges. The city may pursue the collection of such
costs through either judicial proceedings filed in the appropriate court
against the owner, or through the foreclosure of the special assessment lien as
described below, or both.
   (E)   Assessment and lien for charges. At least once a year, the Clerk shall
prepare and present to the Council a resolution containing a list of all unpaid
accounts resulting from the city’s cutting of nuisance vegetation. Such
resolution shall identify the real property on or adjacent to which the
nuisance vegetation was cut, the names of all owners and the balance owing for
the costs and administrative fee. Upon passage of such resolution, the charges
stated therein shall constitute a special assessment and lien upon the affected
property. A copy of the resolution, after passage, shall be certified and
forwarded to the appropriate county officials for collection in the same manner
as other taxes and special assessments. The city shall have the right to
enforce or foreclose such lien with the same remedies, such as a sale of the
premises, that are available under state law for the enforcement or foreclosure
of any other tax or assessment lien.
   (F)   Appeal; hearing. Any owners or other persons who believe they have
been aggrieved by the obligations, responsibilities, procedures, decisions,
assessments or other actions provided herein have the opportunity to appeal or
challenge the same in a hearing before the City Council. Any such person
desiring such hearing shall notify the Clerk in writing and provide a written
explanation as to what actions are being questioned or appealed. Following the
receipt of such notice, the Mayor shall set a hearing before the Council. The
person making such appeal shall be notified of the date and time of the hearing
and given the opportunity to appear and have the appeal heard. Following such
hearing, the Council shall decide the issues presented. Violations of this
section are not criminal offenses.

repaired under orders of the Council. Such resolution shall be in every manner
prepared and certified the same as resolutions levying assessments for the
making of improvements in special improvement districts. Such resolution shall
be delivered to the appropriate county official, who shall collect such
assessments in the same manner as that used in the collection of assessments on
or for improvements in a special improvement district. The collection procedure
for the assessed costs shall unless otherwise provided herein, be the same as
that provided in state law for the collection of assessments for improvements
in special improvement districts.
   (E)   Special fund; warrants.
      (1)   Fund created. There is hereby created a fund to be known as the
Special Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Fund. All monies hereafter collected from
assessments made for construction, replacement or repair of sidewalks, curbs
and/or gutters ordered by the Council shall be placed to the credit of this
special fund. When any sidewalk, curb and/or gutter is constructed, replaced or

warrant is called for redemption or payment, as provided by law. The rate of
interest on such warrants shall be three basis points above the New York prime
interest rate level that is in effect as of the date of such warrant.
         (b)   Such NEW YORK PRIME INTEREST is defined as the base rate on
corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s 30 largest banks.

following year.
      (3)   Delinquent payments. In the event assessments are not paid on or
before the said dates, the same shall be subject to the same interest and
penalties for non-payment as delinquent real property taxes under state law.
Such assessments shall bear simple interest and the interest payable with each
installment shall be the interest on the whole amount of the principal balance
of such assessment remaining unpaid, and shall be calculated to January 1 of
year following the year for which such installment is due. Such interest shall
be calculated from the date specified in the resolution, as passed and adopted
by the City Council, levying such assessment. Such assessments may be paid in
full, at any time, by the payment of the whole amount thereof remaining unpaid
together with interest thereon to the date of payment. The interest rate on

dangerous sidewalk or to remove obstructions therefrom shall not constitute a

shall be so construed as to release the owners, tenants or occupants of real
estate from the duty of keeping the sidewalks in front of or adjoining their
respective premises, at all times, in a safe and passable condition, and in

and imposed upon all such owners, tenants and occupants.
(Prior Code, § 7-1-13)
EXCAVATIONS
§ 151.025 SCOPE OF CITY’S AUTHORITY.
   All excavations within publicly dedicated places are subject to the consent
of the city, with the exception that excavations within the rights-of-way or
thoroughfares owned and controlled by the state shall be governed by applicable
state rules and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 7-2-1)
§ 151.026 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   EXCAVATION. Any excavating, digging or opening up, including, but not
limited to, such things as EXCAVATIONS for connecting, installing, repairing,
replacing, removing, placing or locating a water or sewer main, service line,
pipe or other conduit; electrical, telephone, telecommunications, transmission
or cable television lines; for providing, maintaining or locating any other
utility service or apparatus; or an excavation for any other useful, reasonable
and lawful purpose.
   PUBLICLY DEDICATED. A place shall be regarded as PUBLICLY DEDICATED when
shown to be dedicated for the use of the public according to instruments or
records filed with the County Clerk and Recorder.
   PUBLICLY DEDICATED PLACE. Includes any street, road, alley, right-of-way or
other place that is dedicated for the use of the public.
(Prior Code, § 7-2-2)
§ 151.027 RESTORATION AND FILLING OF EXCAVATIONS.
   (A)   Duty to restore. All excavation sites in publicly dedicated places
shall be restored. Restoration shall include refilling holes, resurfacing
excavated portions and any and all other things necessary to return the site to
a condition that approximates, as reasonably close as possible, the condition
existing prior to the excavation work. All surplus and waste materials shall be
removed from the site. All holes or trenches shall be refilled in a good and
workpersonlike manner with proper material to prevent sinking, caving in,
settling or deterioration of the surface. The surface of the affected area
shall be made substantially even with the surrounding surface. Where a paved or
asphalt surface has been excavated, the affected area shall be resurfaced with
asphalt or cement when conditions allow such work to be done. Any settling or
sinking attributable to an excavation shall be filled or corrected.
   (B)   Standards for work. Specifications, requirements and standards for
refilling, backfilling, resurfacing or other restoration necessary for
excavations in publicly dedicated places shall be adopted by the City Council
and shall govern and apply to all restorations of such excavations. Excavations
in areas of state highways or rights-of-way shall be restored according to any
standards and regulations of the state governing such excavations.
   (C)   Owner responsibility. The owner of the real property for whose benefit
the excavation was done is responsible for the refilling, resurfacing or other
restoration of excavations in publicly dedicated places, as provided in this
subchapter. Multiple owners of such property are jointly and severally
obligated. Where ownership of the benefitted property is transferred prior to
completion of restoration, the responsibility for restoration is held jointly
and severally by those who owned the property at the time of the excavation and
subsequent owners acquiring the property prior to the completion of
restoration. When the excavation is done by a utility and not on behalf of or
for the benefit of a particular parcel or landowner, the utility shall be
responsible for the restoration of the excavation as provided in this
subchapter.
   (D)   City may do work. Where an excavation in a publicly dedicated place
has not been restored, or sufficiently restored, or where the surface has
settled following excavation, the city may, upon the failure of the responsible
owner(s) to complete the restoration work, cause such corrective work to be
done or completed. The responsible property owner(s) shall be billed for such

any of the preceding sections shall be so construed as to release the owners,
tenants or occupants of real estate from the duty of keeping the sidewalks in

a lot and for purposes customarily incidental to those of the main use.
Accessory buildings or structures are not permitted unless the lot has a main,
principal or primary building or structure having a bona fide principal, main
or primary use. A lot having a principal or main building or structure with a
principal or primary use that is proven to be established and currently active
on a bona fide basis shall be considered as having a bona fide principal use. A
residence shall be considered a bona fide principal use if the dwelling is
actually occupied on a bona fide basis by at least one natural person who is a
bona fide permanent resident of the lot.
      (5)   Multi-level or multi-use accessory structures. The definitions,
restrictions and criteria for permitting accessory buildings or structures in

to the land (such as size, shape or topography), structure or building involved

permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved, or a use
that is expressly or by implication prohibited in the said district;
