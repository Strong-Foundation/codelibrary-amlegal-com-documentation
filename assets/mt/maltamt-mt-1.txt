SEWER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 53.25 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter shall be to generate sufficient revenue to
pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater
system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the system in proportion
to each user’s contribution to the total loading of the treatment works.
Factors such as strength (BOD and TSS), volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user’s
contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance
costs to each user (or user class).
(Prior Code, § 13.08.010) (Ord. 372, passed - -1989)
§ 53.26 TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The city, or its Director of Public Works, shall determine the total annual
costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary
to maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the
treatment works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total
annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited
to, labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary
modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency
fund.

§ 53.27 WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE.
   (A)   The city, or its Director of Public Works, shall determine for each
user or user class, which discharges wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater
than the average residential user, the average daily volume of wastewater
discharged to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average
daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the wastewater system to determine
such user’s volume contribution percentage. The amount used as the total
average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude infiltration and inflow. The
city, or its Director of Public Works, shall determine for each user or user
class the average daily poundage of five-day 20°C biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the
average daily poundage of all five-day BOD discharged to the wastewater system
to determine such user’s BOD contribution percentage.
   (B)   The city, or its Director of Public Works, shall determine for each
user or user class, the average daily total suspended solids (TSS) poundage
discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average
daily poundage of all TSS discharged to the wastewater system, to determine
such user’s TSS contribution percentage. The volume contribution percentage,
BOD contribution percentage and TSS contribution percentage for each user or
user class shall be multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs
for wastewater treatment of the total volume flow, total five-day 20°C BOD and
total TSS, respectively.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.030) (Ord. 372, passed - -1989)
§ 53.28 SURCHARGE SYSTEM FOR USERS WITH EXCESS BOD AND TSS.
   The city, or its Director of Public Works, will assess a surcharge rate for
all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater
than the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge
sufficient to cover the cost of treating their above-normal strength wastes.
Normal strength wastes are considered to be 200 ppm BOD and 200 ppm TSS. The
surcharge rate structure for such above-normal strength waste dischargers is
set forth in §
53.37 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.040) (Ord. 372, passed - -1989)
§ 53.29 WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE.
   (A)   Each non-residential user’s wastewater treatment cost contributions as
determined in §§
53.27 and
53.28 of this chapter shall be added together to determine such user’s annual
wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class
of user and an equitable service charge may be determined for each user based
on an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user.
   (B)   The governing body may classify industrial, commercial and other
nonresidential establishments as a residential user; provided that, the wastes
from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average
residential user with respect to volume, total suspended solids and BOD.
   (C)   Each user’s wastewater treatment cost contribution will be assessed in
accordance with the rate schedule in §
53.37 of this chapter.

subject to revisions made by the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 12.32.020) (Ord. 446, passed - -2016)
§ 152.077 SKATEPARK RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   It is unlawful for any person to violate any of the following rules and
regulations while at the skatepark.
   (A)   Use of the facility is only allowed during park hours (dawn to dusk).
After hours use or use when closed will result in a trespass citation.
   (B)   All persons within the skatepark area must be alert and exercise
common sense and courtesy to others. Skateparks are prone to flying objects and
bodies. Know individual abilities and skate within them.
   (C)   Proper use of protective gear (helmets, wrist guards, elbow and knee
pads) is strongly recommended. Concrete and steel are harder than an individual
is.
   (D)   Skateboards and in-line skates and kids’ scooters only. Absolutely no
bicycles or motor vehicles. Violations will result in trespass citations and
possible seizure of equipment.
   (E)   No obstacles, other material, glass, food or drink is allowed in the
skatepark. These items jeopardize the skaters.
   (F)   Do not skate if the surface is wet or icy. The skatepark surface is
extremely dangerous when wet.
   (G)   No spectators inside the skating area. Spectators, please watch from
outside the facility; it will be much safer there.
   (H)   Trash containers must be used to keep the park clean and safe. Help
keep the skatepark clean. Use the trash cans; “you pack it in you pack it out”.
   (I)   Be considerate of the surrounding property and neighbors by skating
only in the skatepark area. No loud music.
   (J)   Alcohol, tobacco products, drugs and offensive language are
prohibited.

development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
disruptions; and
      (7)   Ensure compliance with the minimum standards for the continued
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program for the benefit of the
residents.
(Prior Code, § 15.52.040) (Ord. 455, passed 11-23-2021)
§ 154.005 METHODS TO REDUCE LOSSES.
   In accordance with M.C.A. § 76-5-102, these regulations are intended to
reduce flood losses through the following methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or that may cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses of land vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities, be developed or constructed to at least minimum standards or to
otherwise minimize flood damage;
   (C)   Regulate the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are needed to accommodate flood waters;
   (D)   Regulate filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
impact other land, flood water depth or velocity of flood waters;
   (F)   Distinguish between the land use regulations applied to the floodway
within the regulated flood hazard area and those applied to that portion of the
regulated flood hazard area not contained in the floodway;
   (G)   Apply more restrictive land use regulations within the floodway of the
regulated flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that regulations and minimum standards balance the greatest
public good with the least private injury.

§ 154.006 REGULATED AREA.
   (A)   These regulations apply only to the flood hazard areas specifically
adopted herein as regulated flood hazard areas which are more fully and
specifically described in §§
154.035 through
154.039 of this chapter. Requirements and approvals for alterations to the
regulated flood hazard area are specified in §§
154.035 through
154.039 of this chapter. The regulated flood hazard area includes areas
specifically identified, labeled and illustrated on maps such as floodplain,
floodway or flood fringe that have differing uses allowed and minimum building
standards that apply. The regulated flood hazard area is the geographic area
inundated by the flood of 100-year frequency illustrated and depicted in the
referenced studies and maps.
   (B)   The regulated flood hazard area supporting study and maps illustrating
the regulatory area are based on studies and maps that have been specifically
adopted pursuant to M.C.A. §§ 76-5-201 et seq. The maps and accompanying study
become the regulated flood hazard area only when formally adopted by DNRC and
subsequently by the political subdivision by these regulations. The original
source of studies and data may be from a Flood Insurance Study by FEMA, or
other studies by Corps of Engineers, Soil Conservation, United States
Geological Service or other federal or state agency.

REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA
§ 154.035 REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   The regulated flood hazard areas are the 100-year floodplains
illustrated and referenced in the following specific studies and reports
described as follows:
      (1)   May 19, 1987, FEMA Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRMS) 3001620680B for Phillips County, Montana, and only for those
properties that are within the city’s jurisdictional area; and
      (2)   May 19, 1987, FEMA Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRMs) for the City of Malta, Phillips County Montana, and as
amended in conformance with DNRC approval and FEMA Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR) dated December 29, 2006, case number 06-08-B483P.
   (B)   The regulated flood hazard areas specifically described or illustrated
in the above referenced studies and maps of the 100-year floodplain have been
delineated, designated and established by order or determination by the DNRC,
pursuant to M.C.A. §§ 76-5-201 et seq.
   (C)   Use allowances, design and construction requirements specifically in
§§
154.050 through
154.055,
154.070 and
154.071 of this chapter vary by the specific floodplain areas including areas
identified as floodway and flood fringe within the regulated flood hazard area.
(Prior Code, § 15.52.210) (Ord. 455, passed 11-23-2021)
§ 154.036 INTERPRETATION OF REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   The mapped boundaries of the floodplain illustrated in the referenced
studies and maps in this subchapter are a guide for determining whether
property is within the regulated flood hazard area.
   (B)   A determination of the outer limits and boundaries of the regulated
flood hazard area or the flood fringe and floodway within the regulated flood
hazard area includes an evaluation of the maps as well as the particular study
data referenced in this subchapter. Supporting study material for base flood
elevations takes precedence over any map illustrations if it exists.
   (C)   The regulated flood hazard area boundary is delineated by the base
flood elevation. The physical field regulatory boundary of the regulated flood
hazard area is the actual intersection of the applicable study base flood
elevation with the existing adjacent terrain of the watercourse or drainway.
(A.R.M. § 36.15.501(6))
   (D)   The floodway boundary where identified within the floodplain is as
illustrated on the referenced maps and studies. Since the floodway boundary is
a study feature, the location of the boundary may be physically located by
referencing the study data to a ground feature. The Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of the boundary and decision may be appealed as set forth in §§
154.120 through
154.124 of this chapter.
   (E)   The Floodplain Administrator may request additional information
described below to determine whether or not the proposed development is within
the regulated flood hazard area.
      (1)   Where base flood elevations exist, the property owner may provide
additional information which may include elevation information provided by an
engineer or land surveyor in order to determine if the proposed development is
subject to these regulations.
(A.R.M. § 36.15.501(6))
      (2)   Where base flood elevations do not exist, the property owner may
provide additional information to be considered to determine the location of
the regulatory boundary or alternatively provide a computed base flood
elevation provided by an engineer.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of the boundaries and
decision may be appealed as set forth in §§
154.120 through
154.124 of this chapter.
   (F)   Any owner or lessee of property who believes his or her property has
been inadvertently included in the regulated flood hazard area including the
floodway or flood fringe may submit scientific and/or technical information to
the Floodplain Administrator for a determination if the property is
appropriately located. Scientific or technical information submitted to FEMA by
an owner to affect the insurance rating for insurance purposes may be
considered by the Floodplain Administrator. A determination by the Floodplain
Administrator is independent of any determination by FEMA for insurance
purposes.
(Prior Code, § 15.52.220) (Ord. 455, passed 11-23-2021)
§ 154.037 ALTERATION OF REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (A)   Revisions or updates to the specific maps and data that alter the
established floodplains or floodway of the regulated flood hazard area requires
DNRC approval pursuant to M.C.A. § 75-5-203. An alteration of the regulated
flood hazard area is a DNRC-approved amendment to the DNRC order that
originally delineated and designated the 100-year floodplain and is the basis
of the regulated flood hazard area referenced in §
154.035(A)(2) of this chapter. A DNRC-approved alteration consists of revisions
or updates to the specific maps and data of the referenced studies in this
chapter and forms the basis for an amendment to the regulated flood hazard area
in these regulations.
(A.R.M. § 36.15.505)
   (B)   Any change to the regulated flood hazard area as a result of a DNRC
alteration is effective upon amendment to the regulated flood hazard area
described in §
154.035(A) of this chapter.
   (C)   Substantial natural physical change or new technical or scientific
flood data showing that the base flood elevation has or may be changed or was
erroneously established shall be brought to the attention of DNRC and FEMA.
(A.R.M. § 36.15.505(1)(a)) (44 C.F.R. § 65.3)
   (D)   Any floodplain permit application for a proposed development or
artificial obstruction must be denied until a DNRC alteration pursuant to
M.C.A. § 76-5-203 is approved if it causes an increase of one-half feet or more
to the base flood elevation of a regulated flood hazard area without a floodway
or an increase of more than zero feet to the base flood elevation of a
floodway.
   (E)   To propose an alteration, a petition must be submitted to DNRC and
must include the following information:
      (1)   Certification that no buildings are located in the areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
(44 C.F.R. § 65.12(a)(5))
      (2)   Evidence of notice to all property and land owners of the proposed
impacts to their properties explaining the proposed impact on their property;
(44 C.F.R. § 65.12(a)(3))

(A.R.M. § 36.15.505) (44 C.F.R. §§ 60.3(c)(10), 60.3(d)(3), 65.7, 65.12)
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator may represent the permit authority for
any necessary applications, approvals or endorsements such as the FEMA
Community Acknowledgment Form to FEMA where affecting the FEMA special flood
hazard area.
   (G)   A determination by the Floodplain Administrator that land areas
located within the regulated flood hazard area are above the base flood
elevation as proven by a certified elevation survey does not constitute or
require an alteration or an amendment of the regulated flood hazard area and
may be maintained as a public record that more explicitly defines the regulated
flood hazard area boundary.
   (H)   Elevating with suitable fill as permitted does not alter the regulated
flood hazard area or remove the elevated area from the regulated flood hazard
area.
(A.R.M. § 36.15.505(2))
   (I)   A floodplain permit implementing the physical change cannot be
approved until a CLOMR has been issued by FEMA.

   (C)   Powers of the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall have the following
powers:
      (1)   To authorize, upon application in specific cases, such variance
from the requirements of this chapter specified below as will not be contrary
to the public interest, where owing to special physical configurations of a
property, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result
in unnecessary hardship, and that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed.
More specifically, the Board may, after public notice and hearing,
conditionally approve, deny or approve any request to modify the following
requirements of this chapter:
         (a)   Setback requirements;

         (d)   Height and width requirements;

      (2)   Neither the non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in the same district, nor the permitted or non-conforming use of
lands, structures or buildings in other districts are grounds for the issuance
of a variance; and
      (3)   To grant a variance the Board must make a finding that the granting
of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
chapter, will not be injurious to the neighborhood, is the minimum variance
that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure,
or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare. In addition, the Board must
determine:
         (a)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
         (b)   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (c)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the action of the applicant; and
         (d)   That granting the requested variance will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
   (D)   Procedure of Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   Applications for a variance may be submitted to the Board of
Adjustment by any person as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with
the Zoning Administrator an application for variance.

of the variance, as indicated on the application form.

shall give notice of the hearing at least seven days prior to the holding of a
public hearing and shall notify by mail the property owner requesting the
variance.

the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify
the order, decision or determination appealed and may make such order, decision
or determination as deemed necessary and, to that end, shall have powers of the
administrative official whose decision is appealed.
   (B)   Variances or appeals may not allow uses not permitted.
      (1)   Under no circumstances may the Board of Adjustment grant a
variance, nor the City Council grant an appeal, that would allow a use not
permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved, or any
use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in the
district.
      (2)   The City Council may, at its discretion, modify or waive the
requirements of §
156.209 of this chapter.
   (C)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed, unless the administrative official from whom the appeal is
taken, certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal is
filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his
or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
ordered by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   (D)   Appeals from decisions of the Board of Adjustment or City Council.
      (1)   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any
decision of the Board of Adjustment or City Council, or any taxpayer, may
present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such
decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the
illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after
the filing of the decision of the Board of Adjustment or City Council.
      (2)   Upon presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of
certiorari directed to the Board or Council to review such decision of the
Board or Council and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return
thereto must be made and served upon the relator’s attorney, which may not be
less than ten days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ
shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may,
on application, on notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant a
restraining order.
      (3)   The Board or Council need not return the original papers acted upon
by it, but may return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions
thereof as may be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth
such other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the
decision appealed from and shall be verified.
      (4)   If, upon hearing, it appears to the court that testimony is
necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or
appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to
the court with his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law, which
constitutes a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court
will be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the decision brought up for review.
      (5)   Costs shall not be allowed against the Board or Council unless it
appears to the court that it acted with gross negligence, or in bad faith, or
with malice in making the decision appealed from.

§ 156.205 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter, lots, structures and
uses of land and structures may exist which were lawful at the time this
chapter was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited or regulated
under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. The intent of this
subchapter is to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are

that non-conformities shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
   (B)   Non-conforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible

lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter and which actual building construction has been carried on diligently.
ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where
excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or
removal shall be deemed actual construction; provided that, work shall be
carried on diligently.

must meet other requirements of the district.
   (B)   If two or more lots or combination of lots with continuous frontage in
single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this
chapter, and if any of the lots do not meet the requirements established for
lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be
used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates lots with width or area below the requirements
stated in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 17.48.020) (Ord. 390, passed - -1993)
§ 156.207 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND AND STRUCTURES.

structure exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by
this chapter, the use may be continued where it remains otherwise lawful;
provided:
   (A)   No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its non-conformity;

structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 70% of its
replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed

§ 156.208 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards,
location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions.
   (A)   No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its non-conformity.
   (B)   Should such non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of a
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 70% of its
replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed

   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Malta Airport. Such zones are shown on
the Malta airport zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Kadrmas, Lee
& Jackson, Consulting Engineers, and dated 4-28-1997, which is attached to the
ordinance codified herein on file in the office of the City Clerk and made a
part hereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
   (B)   The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows.

chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change
or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of
the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of non-
conforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure; the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date hereof, and is
diligently prosecuted.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing non-conforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Chairperson of the
county’s Airport Authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the
vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers
and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the
owner of the installation.
(Prior Code, § 17.46.060) (Ord. 409, passed - -2002)
§ 157.07 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in divisions (A)(1), (A)
(2) and (A)(3) below, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been
applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the
purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to
permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with
the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless a variance has been
approved in accordance with division (D) below.
      (1)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain,
land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above
the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      (2)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
      (3)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition
zones. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed
as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter, except as set forth in §
157.04(L) of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a non-conforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date hereof or any amendments thereto or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
   (C)   Non-conforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Chairperson
determines that a non-conforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more
than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height
limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the federal aviation
administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport authority
for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport
Authority does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the
Board of Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
   (E)   Obstruction marking and lighting.
      (1)   Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed
advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the
circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or
tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner’s expense, such
markings and lights as may be necessary.
      (2)   If deemed proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be
modified to require the owner at its own expense, to install, operate and
maintain the necessary markings and lights.
