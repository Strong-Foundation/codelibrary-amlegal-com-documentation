defraud any person.

of this code prohibit the commission of any act, not only the person actually

shall be guilty of the offense described and liable to the penalty set forth.

a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar
any other penalty being enforced.
Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a
breach of any section or provision of this code and there shall be no fine or
penalty specifically declared for such breach, the provisions of the general
penalty clause shall apply and a separate offense shall be deemed committed

the city. Larger meters shall be paid for by the owner or user. Such meters
shall be installed on said service pipes in such manner and place as may be
prescribed by the director of public works or his authorized representative.
No meters shall be placed in service nor recognized as standard meters within
the city unless approved by the public works department. The public works
director or his representatives shall prescribe the size of meter to be placed
on each service pipe, and no person shall place any other meter on any service
pipe, save and except standard meters as herein prescribed and of the size as
prescribed by the public works department. All meters heretofore or hereafter
installed shall be equipped with a remote read meter reading device approved by
the public works department enabling the reading of the meter from the exterior
of the premises served. The public works department is hereby authorized to
establish uniform rates for the installation and rental of such remote read
meter reading devices, such charges to be paid by the owner of the premises
served by such device.
No water meter shall be installed save and except by a plumber, duly licensed
under the laws of the state or by the department of public works, and no person
other than one acting under the authority and direction of said department
shall open, repair or interfere with any water meter. Such meters are owned by
the city and are furnished to consumers and set in place without charge,
provided proper receptacles are provided for them and the service pipes are
suitably arranged. All meters installed within the city shall be provided with
a cutoff valve on each side of said meter so that any meter may be removed for
the purpose of testing and a bypass placed in the service pipe for the purpose
of supplying the consumer with water during the testing of said meter.
Consumers supplied by meter shall take every responsible precaution to protect
the same from injury or damage by frost or other cause and shall be liable for
all injury to meters. If from any cause the meter fails to register correctly,
the charge to the consumer shall be at the rate used for the corresponding
period of the month previous, or if for any reason the rate for the
corresponding period of the previous month cannot be justly applied, the rate
shall be equitably adjusted by the department of public works. For the testing
of each meter at the request of the property owner, if the meter is found
defective, no charge will be assessed. If the meter is in good working order
and registering properly, the property owner shall be charged for two (2) hours
of the operator's time. (Ord. 354, 2-21-1984; amd. Ord. 486, 3-17-2008; Ord.

3-1-27: SEPARATE STOPCOCK REQUIRED:
Service pipes must be so arranged that the supply for each separate house or
premises may be controlled by a separate stopcock placed at a point designated
by the department of public works, and the owner or agent of said property will
be held responsible for all bills for water used through said service. (Ord.
354, 2-21-1984; amd. Ord. 588, 1-19-2021)
3-1-28: OWNER RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICE PIPES; COST:
The service pipe within and without the premises and through its entire length
to the tap in the city water main, together with the stopcock and box must be
laid, kept in repair and protected from freezing at the expense of the owner,
who shall be responsible for all damages resulting from leaks and breaks. No
claims shall be made against the city on account of the breaking of any service
pipes or apparatus or for the failure in supply of water. When there is a leak
in the street and it is doubtful whether the water is from a break in the city
main or from a private service pipe, employees of the public works department
shall determine which it is from. If the leak is found to be from the main the
public works department will make all repairs, but if it is from the service
pipe, the owner of the property or agent will be notified and must immediately
take charge of the excavation, repair the leak, replace the street and be
responsible for all damages which may result. In case the agent or owner does
not make repairs at once, the public works department will proceed, and all
bills for labor and materials will become a charge against said property and
shall be collected from the owner or agent. In the event such bill is not paid,
the enforcement of payment thereof will be performed in the same manner as the
payment of bills for water usage. Also, if during water main or meter
replacement or repair, a property is found to have a service pipe made of lead
or other unapproved material, the service pipe must be replaced. Lead pipe will
not be reconnected to the main. (Ord. 354, 2-21-1984; amd. Ord. 588, 1-19-2021)
3-1-29: RATES TO BE CHARGED WHEN WATER TURNED ON; WHEN DUE:
Water charges at the established rate as approved by the City of Sidney City
Council will be charged against the property from the date on which the water
is turned on until the date on which the water is turned off, but no charge
will be made nor water furnished for less than one-half (1/2) the monthly rate.
No abatement of water charges shall be allowed by reason of removal from the
premises, disuse or diminished use of water, frozen pipes or vacancy of
premises, unless approval is given at the time of such removal or disuse by the
public works department.
All bills for water, whether by flat rate or meter, are due and payable at the
office of the public works department on the first day of each month and will
become delinquent on the tenth day of the month. Owners of property served are
responsible for all water and service charges. Payments will be accepted from
tenants, but that will not relieve the owner of primary responsibility. (Ord.
354, 2-21-1984; amd. Ord. 588, 1-19-2021)
3-1-30: WHEN SERVICE DISCONTINUED:
Failure to pay for water and service charges or violation of any of the rules
and regulations contained in this chapter shall be grounds for discontinuance
of water service. Service shall be discontinued in accordance with rules and
regulations provided by the public service commission of the state. Any person
notified that their service will be discontinued shall be entitled to meet with
the city water clerk to present any facts or circumstances that they believe
justify their failure to pay water or service charges or other violation of
rules and regulations. Any person not satisfied with the determination made by
the water clerk after such meeting shall have the right to appeal such decision
to the city council in the same manner as set forth for appeals of water
service determinations as contained in this chapter. (Ord. 354, 2-21-1984; amd.

is being delivered from the water mains of the city for the purpose of
inspecting the condition of the pipes and fixtures and the manner in which the
water is used and shall also have the right to remove the meters from premises
for examination and tests when necessary. Such notice shall not be required in
emergency situations. (Ord. 354, 2-21-1984; amd. Ord. 588, 1-19-2021)

3-5-4: Hookup Fee
3-5-5: Hearings On Establishment Of Special Charges
3-5-6: Liability For Payment And Collection Of Charges
3-5-7: Notification
3-5-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter shall be to generate sufficient revenue to pay all
costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater system. The
costs shall be distributed to all users of the wastewater system in proportion
to each user's contribution to the total loading of the treatment works. Facts
such as strength (BOD and TSS), volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics
shall be considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to
ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each
user. (Ord. 314, 9-21-1981)
3-5-2: DETERMINING THE TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE:
The city or its city engineer, shall determine the total annual costs of
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to
maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment
works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual
cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to:
labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications,
power, sampling, laboratory tests, and a reasonable contingency fund. The
amount of net revenues in each fiscal year in excess of necessary costs of
operation and maintenance shall not be less than one and twenty five one-
hundredths (1.25) times the sum of the principal and interest payments to
become due in any subsequent calendar year on all outstanding bonds which are
payable from such net revenues, this amount having been determined to be
necessary for the security of the bonds and for adequate depreciation and
replacement of the system. (Ord. 314, 9-21-1981)
3-5-3: DETERMINING EACH USER'S WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE:
The city or its city engineer, shall determine each user's average daily volume
of wastewater, which has been discharged to the wastewater system, which shall
then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the
wastewater system, to determine each user's volume contribution percentage. The
amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude
infiltration and inflow. The city or its city engineer, shall determine each
user's average daily poundage of five (5) day twenty degree centigrade (20°C)
biochemical oxygen demand discharged to the wastewater system to determine each
user's biochemical demand contribution percentage.
The city or its city engineer, shall determine each user's average suspended
solids poundage which has been discharged to the wastewater system which shall
then be divided by the average daily poundage of all suspended solids
discharged to the wastewater system, to determine the user's suspended solids
contribution percentage. Each user's volume contribution percentage,
biochemical oxygen demand contribution percentage and suspended solids
contribution percentage shall be multiplied by the annual operation and
maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the total volume flow, of the
total five (5) day twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand
and of the total suspended solids, respectively.
For all premises within the corporate limits of the city the monthly charge for
service shall be based upon water usage and the initial charge shall be based
upon the schedule which is adopted by reference and on file in the office of
the city clerk, and said rates shall be effective on September 21, 1981. (Ord.
314, 9-21-1981)
3-5-4: HOOKUP FEE:
   A.   There shall be charged a onetime fee for a new connection of any
building or mobile home to the city sewer system. Such fee shall be computed
according to the following schedule:
Size Of Dwelling Unit Value Amount Of Fee
                            ($500.00/Unit)
Size Of Dwelling Unit Value Amount Of Fee
                            ($500.00/Unit)
Single-family    2 units    $1,000.00
Two-family       4 units    2,000.00
Three-family     5 units    2,500.00

Eight-family     8 units    4,000.00
 
For the purposes of this section all motels and hotels and all residential
structures larger than eight-family shall be charged at a one fee unit per
dwelling unit. All mobile homes shall be classified as single-family size
dwellings. All other buildings or facilities which are not residential in
nature shall be reviewed and charged on a case by case basis using an EDU
(equivalent dwelling unit) multiplier based on water service line size. (Ord.
533, 1-9-2012)
   B.   For the purposes of this section a new connection shall be deemed to
include the expansion of existing buildings beyond the present size designation
of the building served or the addition of new buildings to an existing sewer
connection.
In such cases the hookup fee charged shall be the appropriate amount from the
above schedule less the amount that would have been charged under the above
schedule for connection to the sewer system of the improvements as they existed
on June 5, 1978. (Ord. 314, 9-21-1981)
3-5-5: HEARINGS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIAL CHARGES:
Any person who is of the opinion that by reason of special circumstances any of
the foregoing rates and charges are inequitable as applied to premises owned or
occupied by him may file with the city clerk a written application for revision
thereof, setting forth the said circumstances. The council shall then at its
next regular session, or at a subsequent regular meeting if requested by the
applicant, hear the view of the applicant and all other persons interested, and
may in its discretion by resolution fix a special service charge in such amount
as shall be deemed just and equitable, for the period during which such special
circumstances shall exist. (Ord. 314, 9-21-1981)
3-5-6: LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT AND COLLECTION OF CHARGES:
The owners and occupants of all premises to which municipal sewerage service is
rendered or made available shall be jointly and severally liable for all
charges imposed for such service. All monthly charges for sewerage service
shall be made a part of the statements, if any, for water service to the same
premises, and no payment of water or sewerage charges so billed shall be
accepted without payment of both of such items. All bills for sewerage service
shall become due on the first day of the month following billings, and if not
paid by the tenth day of that month, or upon failure of any customer to comply
with all rules and regulations established for the sewerage system within
thirty (30) days after notice of violation thereof, the water service to the
premises involved shall be discontinued and shall not be resumed until payment
of all past due bills for water and sewer service and compliance with all such
rules and regulations. In the event of nonpayment of a statement for sewerage
service to premises not connected with the municipal water system, on or before
the thirtieth day of the month following billings, the city clerk shall notify
the council, and service to such premises shall be cut off within such time and
upon such notice and in such manner as the council shall determine. No service
so discontinued shall be resumed except upon payment of a charge determined by
the council to be adequate to reimburse the city for all costs of the
discontinuance and resumption of service. (Ord. 314, 9-21-1981)

3-5A-6: USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS:
   A.   Protection Of Sewage System: No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any unpolluted water such as stormwater, surface water, groundwater,
roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or cooling water to any sewer.
   B.   Unpolluted Drainage: Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall
be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or
to a natural outlet approved by the director of public works and the Montana
state department of health. Unpolluted industrial cooling water or process
waters may be discharged, upon approval of the director of public works, to a
storm sewer or natural outlet.
   C.   Prohibited Discharges: Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall
discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or
wastes to any public sewer:
      1.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard including, but
not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than one
hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140°F) or sixty degrees Celsius (60°C) using
the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. These wastes include, but are not
limited to, gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, etc., in solid, liquid or
gaseous form.
      2.   Toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to contaminate the sludge of
any municipal system, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process
or equipment, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public
nuisance, or result in the pass through of inadequately treated wastes to
receiving waters.
Each user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the city treatment works shall
pay for such increased costs.
      3.   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to,
ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar,
plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and
fleshings, entrails, paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or
ground by garbage grinders.
   D.   Harmful Materials/Substances: The following described substances,
materials, waters and wastes shall be limited in discharges to municipal
systems to concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers,
the sludge of any municipal system, the wastewater treatment process or
equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or will not
otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. The
engineer may set limitations lower than the limitations established in the
regulations below if, in his opinion, such more severe limitations are
necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his opinion as to the
acceptability, the director of public works will give consideration to such
factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in
the sewers, materials of construction for the sewers, the wastewater treatment
process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which
shall not be violated without approval of the engineer are as follows:
      1.   Wastewater having a temperature higher than one hundred fifty
degrees Fahrenheit (150°F) (65°C).
      2.   Wastewater containing petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils,
or product of mineral oil origin.
      3.   Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils, fat, or
grease.
      4.   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders
may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or similar places where
garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or when served by caterers.
      5.   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or deleterious substances to
such degree that any such material received in the composite wastewater at the
wastewater treatment works exceeds the limits established by the director of
public works for such materials.
      6.   Any waters or wastes containing pollutants which result in the
presence of toxic or obnoxious gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in
quantities which may cause acute worker health and safety concerns or public
nuisance.
      7.   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the director of public works
in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      8.   Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both, which constitute a
"slug" as defined herein.
      9.   Waters and wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over the receiving waters.
      10.   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
      11.   Pollutants which cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW but
in no case discharges with pH lower than 5.0 unless the POTW is specifically
designed to accommodate such discharges.
      12.   Any trucked or hauled wastes unless the POTW is designed to
adequately treat the wastes and the facility has points designated for such
discharges.
   E.   Interceptors:
      1.   Required: Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when,
in the opinion of the director of public works, they are necessary for the
proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units.
      2.   Type; Capacity: All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the director of public works and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
      3.   Construction: Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and
watertight.
      4.   Maintenance: Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors
shall be maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient
operation at all times.
   F.   Review And Approval Required: The admission into the public sewers of
any waters or wastes having: 1) a five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand
greater than three hundred (300) parts per million by weight, 2) containing
more than three hundred fifty (350) parts per million by weight of suspended
solids, 3) containing any quantity of substances having the characteristics
described above, or 4) having an average daily flow greater than two percent
(2%) of the average daily sewage flow of the city, shall be subject to the
review and approval of the engineer.
   G.   Pretreatment:
      1.   Required: Where necessary in the opinion of the director of public
works, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment as
may be necessary to: a) reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to three hundred
(300) parts per million and the suspended solids to three hundred fifty (350)
parts per million by weight, b) reduce objectionable characteristics or
constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in subsection F of this
section, or c) control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or
wastes.
      2.   Approval Required: Plans, specifications and any other pertinent
information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be
submitted for the approval of the director of public works and of the board of

      3.   Maintenance: Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for
any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation, by the owner at his expense.
   H.   Surcharge Rate: The city, or its director of public works, will
determine the average total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average nonindustrial user. The city, or
its director of public works, will assess a surcharge rate for all industrial
users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average
nonindustrial user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover
the costs of treating such users' above normal strength wastes. Normal strength
wastes are considered to be one hundred fifty five (155) ppm BOD and one
hundred fifty seven (157) ppm TSS.
   I.   Manhole: When required by the director of public works, the owner of
any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate
observation, sampling and measurement of the waste. Such manhole, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in
accordance with the plans approved by the director of public works. The manhole
shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   J.   Measurement Of Characteristics: All measurements, tests and analysis of
the characteristics of water and wastes to which references are made in the
above sections shall be determined in accordance with "Standard Methods For The
Examination Of Water And Sewage", and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided for in subsection I of this section or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected.
   K.   Special Agreement And/Or Agreements: No statement contained in this
section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of
unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment,
subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern. (Ord. 552, 6-2-2014)

in this manner and the check has been returned for insufficient funds.
When service is discontinued the employee shall leave notice upon the premises
in a manner conspicuous to the customer that the service has been discontinued
and the address and telephone number of the city office where the customer may
arrange to have service restored.
Rule 15. Notwithstanding any other provision to these rules, the city shall
postpone the physical discontinuation of service to a residential customer for

requested.
Rule 17. Subject to the requirements of these rules the city may discontinue
service to a customer for one or more of the following reasons:
   A.   Nonpayment of a delinquent account,
   B.   Failure to post a cash deposit when required,
   C.   Unauthorized interference with or diversion or use of the service
situated or delivered on or upon the customer's premises,
   D.   Refusal to grant access at reasonable times to equipment installed on
the premises of the customer for the purpose of inspection, meter reading,
maintenance or replacement,
   E.   Misrepresentation of identity for the purpose of obtaining service,
   F.   Violation of any other rule of the city on file which adversely affects
the safety of the customer or other persons or the integrity of the city's
delivery system.
Rule 18. The city shall not discontinue service pursuant to these rules unless
written notice by first class mail is sent to the customer or personally served
at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the proposed discontinuance. Notice
shall be sent to the account name and address and to the address where service
is provided if different. In those cases where the city has knowledge that the
owner of the property and the person in whose name the account is, are
different, notice shall be sent to both. Service of notice by mail is complete
upon mailing. An accurate record of the date of mailing shall be kept by the
city.
Notice of discontinuance shall not be issued if a customer has pending with the
city a complaint concerning the bill upon which the notice is based.
Rule 19. The notice shall contain the following information:
   A.   The name and address of the customer and the owner of the property if
different from the customer,
   B.   A clear and concise statement of the reason for the proposed
discontinuation of service,
   C.   The date, or within a reasonable time thereafter, upon which service
will be discontinued unless the customer takes the appropriate action,
   D.   The right of the customer to meet with the city water clerk to present
facts or circumstances justifying failure to pay water or service charges or
violation of any other rule that is specified in the notice and be represented
by counsel at such meeting,
   E.   The telephone number and address of the city office where the customer
may make inquiry, enter into a settlement agreement or file a complaint. If the
customer cannot pay the entire outstanding delinquent account at that time and
does not dispute the amount due and owing, the city water clerk may enter into
a settlement agreement providing for payment over a period of time, and if such
agreement is entered into, service shall not be discontinued.
Rule 20. When a customer advises the city water clerk prior to the date of any
proposed discontinuation of service that a bill as rendered is in dispute or
any other complaint concerning the service received, the water clerk shall note
the date, time and place the complaint is made; investigate the complaint
promptly; advise the customer of the results of the investigation; attempt to
resolve the dispute informally in a manner mutually satisfactory to both
parties; provide the opportunity for the customer to enter into a reasonable
settlement agreement in order to mutually settle the disputed claim or satisfy
any account not in dispute.
Rule 21. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute in a mutually
satisfactory manner, the customer shall have the right to bring the matter
before the city council of the city as more fully set forth in chapter 1 of
this title.
If only part of a bill is in dispute, the customer shall pay that part not in
dispute within five (5) days of meeting with the city water clerk. Failure to
make payment within that time shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal
the water clerk's decision.
If the dispute is ultimately resolved in favor of the customer in whole or in
part, any excess money paid by the customer shall be refunded promptly with
interest at the then current money market certificate rate, as computed by the
average rate of the three (3) major banks in Sidney.
Rule 22. The city does hereby claim a lien against any property served for any
unpaid delinquent accounts. The connection of any parcel of property to the
city's water and/or sewer service system and the acceptance of service from the
city shall constitute an acknowledgment of and acceptance of any lien claimed
pursuant to these rules. For this reason, the owners of all property shall be
held liable for any account entered into by a tenant and shall be ultimately
responsible for payment of the service charges, repair and replacement of meter
or any other damage not caused by the city, even though the account with the
city may be established in the name of the tenant. As set forth above, notice
of any discontinuation of a tenant will also be provided to the owner of the
property.
A copy of these rules and regulations shall be filed with the clerk and
recorder of Richland County, Montana, for the purpose of giving notice of this
lien, and all persons who thereafter acquire any property connected to the
water and/or sewer system in the city shall acquire such property subject to
such lien in the same manner as any other tax or assessment. (Ord. 360, 9-4-
1984)

use, and any other vehicle of any nature mounted on wheels and suitable for
human occupancy. Such vehicles may be with or without kitchen and toilet
facilities or self-contained water and sewage systems. "Camper vehicle" does
not include mobile homes or manufactured homes.

housekeeping, business, residence, or other purposes associated with human
occupation or habitation, for any duration and whether or not occurring on an
overnight basis.

5-3-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to limit the use of camper vehicles and other
nonpermanent structures for permanent human habitation because it is the
determination of the city council that their use in the city for permanent
human habitation is deleterious to the health, safety, and welfare not only of
the persons residing therein, but, additionally, of the public at large.
Portable heating devices, nonstandard electrical connections, a lack of
approved sanitary facilities, including, but not limited to, bathrooms with
toilets, sinks or showers or bathtubs and standard kitchen facilities, among
other facilities associated with safe places of permanent human habitation, all
lend themselves to unhealthful, unsanitary and hazardous living conditions, if
utilized for extended periods of time, occasioned in part because camper
vehicles and other nonpermanent structures are not intended for use as places
of permanent human habitation and do not adequately provide for the needs
associated with human habitation. (Ord. 544, 12-17-2012)
5-3-3: VIOLATIONS:
Camper vehicles shall not be used for dwelling, living, sleeping, or business
purposes within the city outside an approved RV park and it shall be unlawful,
within the corporate limits of the city, for any person to park or allow to be
parked any camper vehicle on any premises owned by any person, whether that
vehicle is occupied or unoccupied, except as provided in this chapter. (Ord.

   G.   Abatement And Collection Of Costs:
      1.   Determination Of Compliance: Upon expiration of the property owner's
ten (10) day time-frame for abatement, the enforcement agency shall conduct an
inspection of the premises to determine whether abatement or mitigation has
occurred.
      2.   Administrative Sanctions: In the event the enforcement agency has
determined that no abatement or mitigation has occurred within ten (10) days
after the date of the notice, the following procedure shall apply:
         a.   The code enforcement officer shall notify the owner or
responsible party by certified mail with an administrative citation indicating
that community decay conditions exist on the property and that the owner or
responsible party must take measures to correct the violation.
         b.   If the code enforcement officer believes it is advisable, he or
she may post a dated order in a conspicuous place on the property, providing
notice that community decay condition(s) have been found on the property and

8-3-9: PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING AND ASSESSING COSTS OF ABATEMENT:
The property owner shall be sent an abatement expense report for the subject
property and be given notice that any assessment that is not paid shall become

owners will be kept by the Clerk through June 31 of each year, and the list

"The Official Zoning Map of the City of Sidney" that is adopted and made a part
of this title as if it were set out here in full detail, shows the location and
boundaries of the zoning districts established by this title. The map is on
file in the office of the City of Sidney. The Zoning Administrator shall
maintain the Zoning Map and must revise the map to reflect amendments approved
by the City Council as soon as possible after the effective date of the

Zoning Map of the City of Sidney are hereby repealed and replaced."

the City of Sidney, the Official Zoning Map of the City of Sidney bearing the
original signatures of the Mayor and City Clerk filed and kept in the Office of
the Clerk of the City of Sidney shall be the final authority as to the current
zoning status of land, buildings or other structures in the City. (Ord. 567, 3-
20-2017)
11-2-4: INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
When the ordinance establishing a zoning district boundary describes the
boundary as following a certain feature, or reflects a clear intent that the
boundary follows a certain feature, the boundary shall be construed as
following that feature as it actually exists at the time the zoning district
boundary is established. When an ordinance does not describe the zoning
district boundary, the following rules shall be used by the Zoning
Administrator to determine the boundary.
   A.   Right-Of-Way Boundaries: Zoning district boundaries depicted on the
Zoning Map shall follow the parcel boundaries as defined and should not extend
to the center line of the right-of-way unless absolutely necessary.
   B.   Parallel Features: Boundaries shown on the map as approximately
parallel to features or lines shall be construed as parallel to the feature or
line.
   C.   City Limits: Boundaries shown on the map as approximately following
lines of the City limits shall be construed as following the lines of the City
limits.
   D.   Water Features: Boundaries shown as approximately following the center
line of rivers, creeks, streams, canals, lakes, ditches or other bodies of
water shall be construed as following the center line of the body of water.
Boundaries shown as approximately following the shoreline of a body of water
shall be construed to follow the shoreline. In the event of a natural change in
a shoreline or center line, the district boundary shall be construed as moving
with the actual shoreline or center line to its new location. In the event of a
change directly or indirectly resulting from human actions, the district
boundary shall not be construed as following the new shoreline or center line
unless a zoning map amendment is approved by the City Council to change the
district boundary.
   E.   Section Lines: Boundaries shown to follow section lines or quarter
section lines shall be construed as following such lines.
   F.   Undefined Boundaries: The location of a boundary that cannot be
determined from the application of the above rules shall be determined by
measuring the distance between the mapped boundary and other features shown on
the map.
   G.   Conflicts With Boundaries: Where uncertainty exists as to the boundary
of a zoning district, or when the street, property lines or other features
existing on the ground are in conflict with those on the Zoning Map, the Zoning
Administrator shall interpret and determine the location of said boundary. The
Zoning Administrator's determination may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment
pursuant to subsection
11-21-8B, "Appeals", of this title. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-2-5: ANNEXATION, CHANGE OF JURISDICTION, ABANDONED RIGHTS-OF- WAY:
Any land added to the City of Sidney is automatically zoned the lowest
residential density until such time as the City Council approves a different
zoning classification.
   A.   Annexations: All new additions and annexations of land to the City of
Sidney shall be zoned Single Household Residential Zoning District (R-1),
unless otherwise classified by the City Council as part of the annexation
decision and is prezoned to a different zoning district following such
prezoning procedures. The City Council can amend the Zoning Map to reclassify
the land to a different zoning classification at a later time following the
rezoning procedures.
   B.   Abandoned Rights-Of-Way, Federal And State Land: All rights- of-way
abandoned, sold or vacated by any County, City, State or Federal agency shall
be assigned the same zoning classification of the adjoining land (or the
acquired property when an acquisition is in conjunction with a right-of-way
vacation) unless the City Council amends the Zoning Map to reclassify the land
to a different zoning classification.
   C.   Lot Or Parcel In More Than One Zoning District: A lot or parcel located
in more than one zoning district may be developed as a single development. The
entire lot or parcel shall be used to meet the minimum site area requirements
of the more restrictive zone. The uses allowed must follow the most restrictive
zone requirements until such parcel is subdivided or rezoned to one zone. (Ord.
567, 3-20-2017)
CHAPTER 3
ZONING DISTRICTS AND STANDARDS
SECTION:
11-3-1: Purpose And Intent
11-3-2: Uses Defined
11-3-3: Standards
11-3-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purposes and intent of this chapter are to describe the various zoning
districts and establish the allowed uses, dimensional standards and other
standards that govern development in each district. This chapter also
establishes the standards for certain zoning overlay districts and a Planned
Unit Development (PUD) Floating Zoning District. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-3-2: USES DEFINED:
   A.   Allowed Uses: The description of each zoning district contains a table
entitled "allowed uses" that establishes the uses allowed in the zoning
district.
   B.   Permitted Uses: Uses that are listed as "permitted" uses are allowed as
"outright uses" or as a matter of right upon the issuance of a zoning
conformance permit. A zoning conformance permit shall be issued pursuant to the
procedures of this title, provided the development or use complies with all
applicable standards of this title, including the standards of general
applicability and any specific standards referenced in the allowed uses table.
   C.   Use Specific Standards: Specific standards that apply to certain uses
are referenced in the allowed uses tables for each zoning district. The
specific standards in the referenced sections apply in addition to the
standards and procedures of general applicability that are established in this
title to apply to all development and land uses.
   D.   Conditional Uses: Uses that are listed as "conditional" uses are
allowed with a conditional use permit (CUP) pursuant to section
11-17-1, "Conditional Uses", of this title. A CUP may be issued at the
discretion of the Zoning Commission, pursuant to the procedures of this title,
provided that the development complies with the standards of general
applicability and the applicable CUP standards, and the Zoning Commission makes
certain CUP findings of fact.
   E.   Conditional Use Findings: Approval of a CUP requires the Zoning
Commission to make certain findings of fact as established in section
11-17-1, "Conditional Uses", of this title.
   F.   Accessory Uses: Accessory uses and accessory buildings as defined in
section
11-23-4, "Definitions", of this title, shall be allowed in all zoning
districts.
   G.   Prohibited Uses: If a use is listed as "prohibited" it is expressly
forbidden in that district.
   H.   Uses Not Listed (Unidentified Uses): If a use is not listed as either a
permitted or conditional use, it is not allowed in the district unless the use
receives a zoning conformance permit and is subject to provisions in subsection
I, "Similar Use Determination", of this section.
   I.   Similar Use Determination: The goal of this title is to allow flexible
uses in zones, especially as uses and technology continue to evolve. If a
proposed use is not listed in the allowed uses table, it may be considered an
allowed use if the Zoning Administrator determines the proposed use is
sufficiently similar to one of the uses listed in the allowed uses table. If a
similar use determination is made in the affirmative, the proposed use shall be
an authorized use with the same permissions and restrictions as the use to
which it is determined to be similar. The Zoning Administrator shall submit a
public notice for publishing in the next issue of the official paper of the
City of Sidney following all decisions to approve or deny a similar use
determination. The notice shall be in accordance with section
11-21-7, "Public Notice", of this title. Any aggrieved party may appeal the
Zoning Administrator's decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the date
the notice appeared in the official paper of the City of Sidney, pursuant to
subsection
11-21-8B, "Appeals", of this title.
A use that meets the standards and notification procedures of this section
shall receive a letter authorizing such use to proceed in the zone in which it
is currently located. The permitted use shall only be authorized for that zone
in which it is located and may not be switched to a different zone. The zoning
conformance letter shall be maintained in the City Clerk's Office and kept on
file for the perpetuity of the use. In no instance shall a non-conforming use
be granted a zoning conformance permit. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-3-3: STANDARDS:
   A.   Dimensional Standards: The description of each district contains a
table entitled "Dimensional Standards" that establishes the dimensional
limitations on all development within the district.
   B.   Specific District Standards: Each district contains a subsection that
establishes development standards that are specific to the particular zoning
district. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)

11-15-7: Required Findings
11-15-8: Expiration
11-15-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of the planned unit development (PUD) is to create a
procedure that allows flexibility to design and develop a site in a creative
and unified approach rather than a traditional lot-by-lot approach. The
flexibility and unified approach is intended to promote high quality open
spaces that are created by clustering development, create a diversity of
housing types, permit a compatible mix of land uses, and achieve context
sensitive design that conforms to topography and minimizes impacts on natural
resources. The flexibility of the PUD also is intended to accomplish goals of
the Sidney Growth Policy. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-15-2: APPLICABILITY AND LOCATION:
A PUD is a development approved pursuant to the standards and procedures of
this chapter and can be located on any site within the City that contains the
following characteristics:
   A.   Infrastructure: Water, wastewater, roadway and stormwater facilities
with sufficient capacity to accommodate the PUD, or these facilities can be
reasonably extended to create the required capacity and that conform to City of
Sidney Public Works standards.
   B.   Connectivity: The opportunity for a PUD with extensive connectivity to
the existing roadway, sidewalk and trail systems.
   C.   Natural Resources: Natural resources that can be better protected by
the flexible design of a PUD than by a traditional lot-by-lot development and
avoid construction in hazardous areas such as floodplains, steep slopes or poor
soils. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-15-3: LAND USES:
   A.   Residential Underlying Zoning: When the underlying zoning is
residential, the PUD may contain all types of residential structures and
commercial uses, provided the mix of uses complies with the findings of section
11-15-7, "Required Findings", of this chapter. Industrial uses are not allowed
in a PUD when underlying zoning is residential.
   B.   Non-Residential Underlying Zoning: When the underlying zoning is
commercial, industrial or another non-residential classification, the PUD may
contain all types of residential structures, commercial and industrial uses,
provided the mix of uses complies with the standards of section
11-15-7, "Required Findings", of this chapter. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-15-4: DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Lot Sizes, Frontage, Setbacks: Lot sizes, lot frontage and setbacks
established for the underlying zoning district may be varied for the purpose of
clustering buildings in a small footprint of development and setting aside open
spaces or protecting natural resources.
   B.   Density, Impervious Coverage: The number of residential units and the
amount of impervious coverage may exceed the limits established for the
underlying zoning in portions of the PUD provided the total property covered by
the PUD complies with these two (2) standards in an overall calculation.
   C.   Building Height: Building heights within the PUD may exceed the maximum
height of the underlying zoning district for the purpose of clustering
development in a small footprint of development and setting aside open spaces
or protecting natural resources. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-15-5: SITE DESIGN STANDARDS:
PUDs shall comply with the following site design standards:
   A.   Building Sites: The configuration and arrangement of development shall
provide each lot and building with a suitable site that minimizes disturbance
of sloping hillsides, protects natural resources and is serviceable by adequate
infrastructure.
   B.   Access: Safe and adequate vehicular access shall be provided to all
lots and building sites to accommodate routine and emergency accessibility.
   C.   Natural Resources: Natural resources shall receive greater protection
than is routinely provided by standards of this title or other State and
Federal regulations. Examples of compliance with this standard include but are
not limited to:
      1.   Setbacks: Providing greater setbacks from water bodies and wetlands
than required by other sections of this title or by the State and Federal
regulations, or
      2.   Hillsides: Avoiding the disturbance of hillsides that is otherwise
permitted by other sections of this title, or
      3.   Wildlife: Protecting wildlife habitats and migration corridors.
   D.   Connectivity, Circulation: The roadway system shall maximize
connectivity to the adjoining streets and promote efficient circulation within
the PUD.
   E.   Pedestrian System: A safe and logical system of sidewalks, trails and
pathways shall provide for convenient pedestrian connections throughout the PUD
and to adjoining neighborhoods.
   F.   Integration, Compatibility: Site design and the arrangement of land
uses shall integrate the PUD with surrounding developments and maximize
compatibility with neighboring properties. The PUD design shall blend with the
existing development pattern and street network of the City.
   G.   Human Interaction: Site design, arrangement of buildings and open
spaces and the circulation system shall provide places for, and promote,
interaction among the residents and workers occupying the PUD.
   H.   Growth Policy: A PUD application shall demonstrate in a convincing and
persuasive way that the proposed development will implement goals and
strategies of the Sidney Growth Policy. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-15-6: STATEMENTS OF STANDARDS:
Upon approval of a PUD, the owner shall prepare a Statement of Standards for
review by the Zoning Administrator that describes the specific uses,
development standards, deviations from the underlying zoning standards and
conditions of approval. This Statement of Standards shall be approved as to
form by the City Attorney and upon approval by the City Council, recorded in
the land records of Richland County. (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)
11-15-7: REQUIRED FINDINGS:
Approval of a PUD shall require the Planning Board/Zoning Commission making the
following findings of fact:
   A.   Growth Policy: The PUD implements the goals and strategies of the
Sidney Growth Policy.
   B.   Consistent With Purpose, Intent: The PUD is fully consistent with the
stated purpose and intent of this chapter and in no way contradicts the purpose
and intent of this chapter.
   C.   Complies With Standards: The PUD fully complies with all applicable
standards of this chapter and this title.
   D.   No Adverse Impact: The PUD creates no significant adverse impact to
neighboring property and does not negatively impact natural resources. (Ord.
567, 3-20-2017)
11-15-8: EXPIRATION:
Approval of a PUD shall expire and become null and void one year after the date
of final approval if development has not commenced. Development of the PUD
shall proceed with reasonable diligence to completion or proceed consistent
with an approved phasing schedule. If development does not proceed with
reasonable diligence to completion or in accordance with an approved phasing
schedule, the Planning Board/Zoning Commission may initiate a review of the
partially completed PUD and determine if a specific schedule of development
should be established for completion or if the PUD approval should be deemed
expired. To render the decision about a completion schedule or expiration of
approval, the Planning Board/Zoning Commission shall consider the following
criteria:
   A.   Functionality: Does the partially complete PUD contain functional
infrastructure, including but not limited to water, wastewater, streets,
stormwater management and pedestrian facilities?
   B.   Visual Blight: Does the partially complete PUD create visual blight
that deteriorates the aesthetic quality of the neighborhood or the City?
   C.   Community Changes: Has the City of Sidney enacted changes to the
policies, goals, strategies or ordinances that would cause the PUD to be denied
approval if it were newly submitted for applicable zoning conformance permits?

   A.   Notwithstanding other dimensional limitations and allowances
established by this title, no manmade building, tower, antenna or other
structure and no tree or other vegetation shall penetrate the vertical plane
described as the Approach Zone in FAA regulations for utility visual approach
runways. The vertical plane in the Approach Zone is defined by the combination
of subsections A1 and A2 of this section.
      1.   The interior edges of the Approach Zone coincide with edges of the
primary surface and is two hundred fifty feet (250') wide, and expands outward
uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a
horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') from the ends of the primary
surface and its center line is a continuation of the center line of the runway.
      2.   Furthermore, the surface of the Approach Zone slopes upward one foot
(1') for each twenty feet (20') outward beginning at the ends, and at the same
elevation as, the primary surface and extending a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') along the extended runway center line.
      3.   By way of example, the Approach Zone establishes a maximum height of
ten feet (10') at a distance of two hundred feet (200') from the ends of the
runway (200 divided by 20, times 1). (Ord. 567, 3-20-2017)

11-17-1: CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: This section establishes standards and required
findings of fact for conditional uses. The purpose of conditional uses is to
allow uses that may be suitable in some but not all locations in the zoning
district in which they are allowed, or require special consideration because of
unusual operational or physical characteristics, or must be designed and
developed with conditions to assure compatibility with adjoining uses.
A conditional use permit (CUP) may be granted to allow a conditional use only
for a use listed as a "conditional" use in an allowed uses table and only after
the Planning Board/Zoning Commission has made findings of fact that the
conditional use complies with the following standards. The following standards
apply in addition to standards of general applicability.
   B.   Findings Of Fact: The Planning Board/Zoning Commission shall make
findings of fact that a conditional use complies with the following standards
as a prerequisite to the City Council granting a CUP.
      1.   Consistent With Growth Policy: The conditional use is consistent
with the policies, goals, objectives and strategies of the Sidney Growth
Policy.
      2.   Compatibility: The conditional use is compatible with the character
of the immediate vicinity including the bulk, scale, and general appearance of

elimination and to permit the limited development of nonconforming lots without
infringing upon the constitutional rights of the owners of such
nonconformities. The continuation of nonconforming uses and structures and the
limited development of nonconforming lots are intended to prevent economic
hardship and to allow the useful economic value of the structure to be
realized. It is further declared and it is the policy of the City of Sidney
that nonconforming uses and structures are generally incompatible with
surrounding uses and are detrimental to the public health, safety, and general
welfare. The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards to regulate the

nonconforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a
conforming use, the use of the property shall not revert back to a
nonconforming use.

discontinued or abandoned for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive
months regardless of the removal or non- removal of furniture/equipment or any

reestablished or resumed including using residential structures for storage of
materials. Any subsequent use of the site shall conform to this title.

legally nonconforming structure must meet all applicable standards in effect at
the time a permit is issued for the alteration, addition, expansion or
enlargement.
   C.   Relocation: A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole or
in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is
located, unless the structure in its new location will conform to the standards
of the zoning district in which it is located.
   D.   Unsafe Because Of Maintenance: If a nonconforming structure, or portion
thereof, becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to the lack of repairs or
maintenance, and is declared by the building official to be an unsafe
structure, it shall be removed or rebuilt or repaired in conformance with the
standards of this title and the currently adopted Building and Fire Codes.

adjacent parcel. As provided by section 76-3-207, Montana Code Annotated, such
boundary line relocations are exempt from the standards of this title.

12-2-1: OVERVIEW AND AUTHORITY:
   A.   Chapter Overview: This chapter addresses the various types of divisions
and aggregations of land that are exempted from review as subdivisions in
accordance with the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act (“MSPA” or “the Act”),
Title 76, Chapter 3, Montana Code Annotated. These are referred to in these
regulations as “exemptions.” This chapter also describes the process and
criteria for reviewing exemptions.
   B.   Authority: The authority in the Act for exemptions from subdivision to
be addressed in these regulations is as follows:
      1.   Title 76, Chapter 3, Part 2, Montana Code Annotated identifies
specific exemptions from subdivision review;
      2.   Sections 76-3-201(5) and 76-3-207(4), Montana Code Annotated

regulations to include an appeal process to the governing body if the reviewing
authority is not the governing body. (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-2-2: PROCESS FOR REVIEW OF DIVISIONS EXEMPT FROM SUBDIVISION:
Review Process: The sequential steps in the review process are as follows:
   A.   The applicant contacts the Subdivision Administrator to assess if the
division appears to qualify as an exemption from subdivision review. The
applicant should be prepared to identify the legal tract of record proposed for
division (refer to subsection
12-2-6A below).
   B.   It is the applicant’s responsibility to contact the Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) reviewer or local sanitarian. Applicants are
advised to consult with the appropriate sanitation reviewer prior to finalizing
division documents. Separate application forms and materials may be required
for approval by DEQ and/or the local sanitarian (refer to section
12-2-5 below for more information on sanitation requirements).
   C.   If a survey is required or desired, the applicant shall hire a surveyor
to prepare a survey (refer to section
12-2-4 below).
   D.   If a survey is not required and not desired, the applicant shall
prepare the written documents necessary for the division. Private legal review
of the documents is recommended.
   E.   The applicant shall submit the information electronically to the
Subdivision Administrator. Information submitted in other formats may incur
additional charges for copying, scanning, or distribution.
   F.   The Subdivision Administrator will review the materials to determine if
all required information has been submitted. If incomplete, the Subdivision
Administrator will notify the applicant in writing of any perceived
deficiencies.
   G.   The Subdivision Administrator review of the exemption includes a check
for compliance with the exemption criteria set forth in these regulations, the
Act, the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARMs), and may include review by the
Examining Land Surveyor if applicable (see subsection
12-2-4B below).
   H.   If the Subdivision Administrator determines that the proposed use of
the exemption is incorrect or an evasion – and therefore denies the application
- the Subdivision Administrator shall identify the reasons in writing to the
applicant.
   I.   The decision on an exemption within thirty (30) working days of receipt
of the application. The applicant may appeal the Subdivision Administrator’s
decision to the governing body as identified in section
12-2-3 below.
   J.   If requested by the Subdivision Administrator, the applicant will
resubmit surveys and documents with corrections.
   K.   The Subdivision Administrator will send written notice to the governing
body, Clerk and Recorder, and copy the applicant when the exempted division is
approved for recording.
   L.   The applicant will submit the final documents to the Richland County
Clerk and Recorder, including warranty deeds and other information required to
be recorded with the division document. (Ord. 591, - -2021)

Any applicant whose proposed use of an exemption has been denied by the
Subdivision Administrator appeal the decision in writing to the governing body
within ten (10) working days of the written decision. The applicant may submit
additional evidence to demonstrate eligibility for the claimed exemption. The
governing body shall notify the applicant and Subdivision Administrator of the
date and time of the review of the appeal. The governing body’s appeal decision
shall be provided in writing to the applicant following the review. If the
governing body’s decision is to authorize use of the exemption, the survey must
be recorded with the written authorization of the governing body.
If the applicant proposing to use an exemption chooses not to appeal a denial
or if, upon appeal, the governing body affirms that the applicant is not
eligible for the claimed exemption, the applicant may submit a subdivision
application for the proposed division of land. (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-2-4: SURVEY REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW:
   A.   Survey Requirements:
      1.   Only divisions exempted under section 76-3-207, Montana Code
Annotated require compliance with the survey requirements of sections 76-3-401,
et. seq, Montana Code Annotated. All other exemptions described in Part 2 of
the Act do not require a survey, but surveys may be submitted voluntarily.
      2.   Any survey, regardless of whether it is required or voluntary, must
comply with the Uniform Standards for Survey Monumentation, Certificates of
Survey, and Final Subdivision Plats (ARM 24.183.1101, 1104, and 1107), as
applicable.
      3.   As provided for in section 76-3-401, Montana Code Annotated, no
survey is required for any exemption, including those in section 76-3-207,
Montana Code Annotated, when the exempted parcel can be described as 1/32 or
larger aliquot part of U.S. government section or as a U.S. government lot,
unless the parcel is a lot in a platted subdivision. A surveyed U.S. government
lot in its entirety does not require a survey; smaller parcels within a
government lot do require a survey. Any parcel that was segregated and conveyed
individually prior to July 1, 1973 requires no survey (47 Op. Att’y Gen. No.
10).
      4.   Any survey submitted as a retracement of an existing parcel shall
provide documentation that the parcel exists as a tract of record.
   B.   Review of Surveys - Compliance With Uniform Standards: The Examining
Land Surveyor shall review all surveys for compliance with the Uniform
Standards for Survey Monumentation, Certificates of Survey, and Final
Subdivision Plats (ARM 24.183.1101, 1104, and 1107). In the event the City of
Sidney has no Examining Land Surveyor, the Subdivision Administrator shall
conduct a review for compliance with general requirements such as title of the
survey, landowner certifications, etc., but shall not be responsible for
aspects which can only be verified by a registered land surveyor, such as the
mathematical accuracy of the survey.
   C.   Identification Codes Included on Surveys: To implement and monitor one
or more tracts of record created by exemption, the following identification
codes shall be added to the numbering of recorded certificates of survey:
CO  Court order [76-3-201(1)(a), MCA]
ME  Mortgage Exemption [76-3-201(1)(b), MCA]

(Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-2-5: OTHER AGENCY REVIEW OF EXEMPTED DIVISIONS:
Divisions of land exempted from the Act are still subject to applicable
regulations and requirements of other agencies. These requirements may restrict
the use of the divided land or preclude the filing of the document creating the
division. Laws and regulations that may restrict or preclude development
include, but are not limited to, zoning, floodplain regulations, fire codes,
and building codes, among others.
The Clerk and Recorder is prohibited from filing a division that does not meet
the sanitation requirements of section 76-4-122(2), Montana Code Annotated. The
landowner is responsible for obtaining the sanitation approvals necessary for a
division of land to be filed with the Clerk and Recorder. All divisions
reviewed as exemptions under these regulations are subject to review by DEQ for
parcels of less than twenty (20) acres, or to the Richland County Sanitarian
for parcels twenty (20) acres or greater, unless a qualifying exemption under
the Sanitation in Subdivisions Act (Title 76, Chapter 4 et seq., Montana Code
Annotated) is deemed applicable and approved by the Exemption Review Committee.
The requirement for sanitation review applies to all parcels resulting from a
division of a tract of record, not only the parcel created via the exemption
under sections 76-3-201 or 76-3-207 et seq., Montana Code Annotated. (Ord. 591,
- -2021)
12-2-6: FILING INSTRUMENTS OF TRANSFER AND IDENTIFYING EXISTING TRACTS OF
RECORD:
   A.   Evidence Of Existing Tract Of Record:
      1.   The Clerk and Recorder may not file any instrument that purports to
transfer title unless the instrument of transfer is accompanied by evidence
that the parcel exists as a tract of record and has been surveyed as
applicable. As required by section 76-3-302, Montana Code Annotated, the
evidence shall consist of:
         a.   An instrument of transfer describing the parcel or tract by
reference to a filed certificate of survey or subdivision plat;
         b.   Documentation that the parcel is in a location in which the state
does not have jurisdiction;
         c.   Previously recorded documents verifying the parcel was created
before July 1, 1973; or
         d.   Documents that, if recorded, would verify the parcel was created
before July 1, 1973.
      2.   In addition, as established by the Montana Attorney General (47 Op.
Att’y Gen. No. 10), a US government lot or an aliquot part of a US government
section is not a tract of record simply because its description appears in a
deed on file. The Clerk and Recorder may not file any instrument that purports
to transfer title to an aliquot part of a US government section or to a
government lot unless accompanied by:
         a.   Reference to recorded documents that verify the parcel was
segregated and individually conveyed prior to July 1, 1973; or
         b.   Reference to recorded documents that verify the parcel was
segregated and individually conveyed after July 1, 1973, but which was exempted
by definition of the word subdivision.
   B.   Remainders: A remaining parcel of land created through the use of one
or more valid statutory exemptions is a tract of record.
   C.   Review Process For Instruments Of Transfer:
      1.   The applicant submitting the instrument of transfer, including but
not limited to warranty deeds or quit claim deeds, shall provide the above
referenced documentation of the tract of record to the Subdivision
Administrator upon application for use of an exemption.
      2.   Once routed to the Subdivision Administrator, the Clerk and Recorder
shall examine the filed documents referenced as evidence and may verify that
the instrument of transfer does not create a new parcel subject to review as a
subdivision and/or subject to survey requirements.
      3.   If it is determined that the instrument of transfer is
insufficiently documented to demonstrate no new parcel is created, the Clerk
and Recorder shall notify the individual in writing that the instrument shall
not be filed until the required documentation is submitted. In addition, the
notice will state that if the individual cannot provide the documentation and
wishes to create a parcel, he/she may contact the Subdivision Administrator for
additional information on requirements for divisions of land as exemptions or
subdivisions. (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-2-7: GENERAL SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:

parcel created by the division, to be recorded with the division document; or,
comparable approval of the proposed sanitation in subdivisions exemption
documentation from the local sanitarian (for parcels twenty (20) acres and
greater) to be recorded with the division document; or, the exemption from DEQ

12-3-3: TYPES OF SUBDIVISIONS:
The following sections identify specific types of subdivisions with special
provisions or review considerations.
   A.   Condominiums:
      1.   Overview: “Condominium” is the ownership of single units with common
elements held jointly by unit owners. All land in a condominium subdivision is
jointly held with undivided interest. The unit owners own their individual
units, not the land beneath the units. The term does not include a townhome or
townhouse.
The following establishes the unique provisions for condominiums under these
subdivision regulations and with reference to Title 70, Chapter 23, Montana
Code Annotated, Unit Ownership Act – Condominiums.
      2.   Process: All condominiums shall be reviewed as major or minor
subdivisions, based on the number of units and the history of divisions on the
existing tract of record, except as provided below.
         a.   Condominiums are exempted from subdivision review, pursuant to
section 76-3-203, Montana Code Annotated, and chapter 12-2 of these
regulations, when:
            (1)   The approval of the original subdivision of land expressly
contemplated the construction of the condominiums and any applicable park
dedication requirements in section 76-3-621, Montana Code Annotated are
complied with; or
            (2)   The condominium is in conformance with applicable local
zoning regulations when local zoning regulations are in effect.
         b.   No construction of any structure may begin until the subdivision
site plan has been approved as a final site plan (section 70-23-301(8), Montana
Code Annotated) and all other applicable agency approvals have been received
(e.g., DEQ, building permits, etc.).
      3.   Review Criteria: Because a condominium does not divide land, a site
plan is required instead of a plat. Condominiums shall be reviewed according to
the criteria in chapter 12-5 of these regulations in addition to the following
requirements:
         a.   Department of Revenue Approval pursuant to section 70-23-304,
Montana Code Annotated;
         b.   Compliance with the requirements of Title 70, Chapter 23, Montana
Code Annotated, “Unit Ownership Act – Condominiums”;
         c.   Building regulations, if applicable; and
         d.   Department of Environmental Quality approval per section 76-4-102
(22), Montana Code Annotated or municipal facilities certification as per
section 76-4-127, Montana Code Annotated.
      4.   Limits On Conveyance: Condominium units shall not be transferred,
conveyed or leased until every mortgage and other lien affecting any unit,
including the undivided interest of the unit in the common elements, is paid
and satisfied or the unit being conveyed or leased and its interest in the
common elements shall be released therefrom by partial release duly recorded
pursuant to section 70-23-602, Montana Code Annotated.
      5.   Creation Of Additional Parcels: No creation of a parcel for
condominiums may result in a parcel or parcels of less than one hundred sixty
(160) acres, unless the parcels are reviewed as lots in a subdivision or as a
valid exemption under Title 76, Chapter 2, Montana Code Annotated.
      6.   Submittal Requirements: The requirements of chapter 12-6 apply,
except that no plat may be necessary but a site plan is required. The following
clarifies other submittal requirements unique to condominiums:
         a.   Survey: The perimeter of the existing tract or tracts of record
shall meet survey requirements of Title 76, Chapter 3, Part 4, Montana Code
Annotated. It is strongly encouraged, but not required, that the site plan
components described below are also represented through formal survey.
         b.   Site Plan:
            (1)   Site plans and floor plans as required by section 70-23-306,
Montana Code Annotated shall show the layout of each unit, including the unit
designation, location and dimensions of each unit, and the common areas to
which each has access, including internal streets, parking and storage areas.
            (2)   The site plan shall be prepared by a registered architect,
registered professional engineer, or registered professional land surveyor as

following additions.
            (1)   No property shall bear a name using a word which is the same
as, similar to, or pronounced the same as a word in the name of any other

subject to an arrangement under which persons own their own units and hold
separate title to the land beneath their units, but under which they may
jointly own the common areas and facilities.
      2.   Process. All townhomes and townhouses shall be reviewed as major or
minor subdivisions based on the number of units and the history of divisions on
the existing tract(s) of record, except as provided below.

         h.   No detached structures are allowed in a designated RV space.
         i.   No RV or its attached structures (e.g. awnings) may be located
within twenty feet (20') of another RV or its attached structures.
         j.   One off-street parking space must be provided on or adjacent to
each RV space. The driveway must be located to allow for convenient access to
the RV and be a minimum of ten feet (10') wide.
         k.   RV parks shall dedicate land to use as a park or recreation area.
The area to be dedicated shall be eleven percent (11%) of the total RV park
area as surveyed for the site plan pursuant to subsection C5 above. These areas
shall remain in private ownership and shall not be dedicated to the public
unless expressly accepted by the local governing body. It shall be the
responsibility of the RV park owner to maintain the park and recreation area.
The governing body may accept cash-in-lieu of park dedication in circumstances
where it is demonstrated park land is not necessary to serve the RV park.
         l.   RV parks located adjacent to industrial, commercial, or lower-
intensity residential land uses (such as single family residential development)
shall provide screening in the form of fencing or natural landscaping along the
property boundary line to mitigate visual impacts to adjacent properties as
well as mitigate potential negative impacts from adjacent uses on RV park
guests.
         m.   The governing body may require that a common area be provided for
the storage or parking of boats, trailers, or other recreational vehicles. If
such a common area is included, it shall be restricted for storage only and no
structure, vehicle, boat or other container may be used for living
inhabitation. This common area shall not be calculated or applied as part of
the required parkland dedication.
   D.   Phased Developments:
      1.   Overview: Phased developments are subdivisions that are developed in
a series of phases over a period of up to twenty (20) years. Phased
developments include review and approval of an overall phased development
preliminary plat, which shows the type and extent of the overall development,
and individual phases, which are reviewed, approved, and developed
sequentially.
      2.   Review Process: The application and review processes for overall
phased development preliminary plats and individual phases are described in
chapter 12-4.
      3.   Review Criteria. The review criteria for overall phased development
preliminary plats and individual phases are described in chapter 12-5.
      4.   Design Standards. The design standards for water and wastewater
treatment, roads, and other elements are described in chapter 12-7. (Ord. 591,
- - 2021)
CHAPTER 4
SUBDIVISION APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCESS
SECTION:
12-4-1: Preliminary Plat Application And Review Process
12-4-2: Final Plat Application And Review Process
12-4-1: PRELIMINARY PLAT APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCESS:
   A.   Pre-Application:
      1.   The applicant shall submit completed pre-application materials to
the Administrator as described in chapter 12-5.
      2.   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the submittal, the
Administrator shall schedule a meeting with the applicant or designated
representatives to discuss the pre-application materials. At the meeting the
Administrator shall:
         a.   Identify state laws, local regulations, and growth policy
provisions, if a growth policy has been adopted, that may apply to the
subdivision proposed;
         b.   Alert the applicant to potentially significant adverse impacts
based on the subdivision review criteria in section 76-3-608, Montana Code
Annotated;
         c.   Provide a list of the public utilities, agencies of local, state,
and federal government, and any other entities that shall be contacted by the
applicant for comment on the subdivision application and the timeframes that
the public utilities, agencies, and other entities are given to respond;
         d.   Establish a time limit after a pre-application meeting by which
an application must be submitted; and
         e.   Provide the applicant with a list of information, documents,
fees, and other materials explaining what must be submitted with a preliminary
plat application. The identification of this information by the Administrator
does not limit her/his ability to require additional information at a later
time.
      3.   The Administrator may invite to the meeting representatives of
affected public utilities and review agencies at the local, state, and federal
levels including, but not limited to, the local sanitarian, DEQ reviewer, clerk
and recorder, and representatives from the public works department, fire
department, law enforcement and others to provide preliminary comments related
to their agency’s purview.
      4.   If a preliminary plat application or request for a pre-application
extension is not received within six (6) months of the pre-application meeting,
the pre-application meeting is void and must be repeated. Requests for an
extension shall be made to the Administrator, who may approve one extension for
up to six (6) months. The Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing
of a decision to approve or deny an extension. If denied, the reason for denial
shall be included in the notice.
      5.   By requesting a pre-application meeting, the applicant agrees not to
begin construction of subdivision-related improvements prior to approval of the
preliminary plat application. Subdivision-related improvements include water,
wastewater, stormwater, and solid waste facilities; utilities, roads, streets
and any improvement requiring grading or earth moving. All historic, cultural,
archeological and natural resources shall remain unaltered, including riparian
vegetation and wetlands. The following activities are permitted prior to
preliminary plat approval:
         a.   Work related to testing, analytical, or monitoring activities
that may be required by these regulations or are relevant to the processing of
the subdivision application; and
         b.   Activities approved in advance and in writing by the
Administrator that qualify as actions that are not subdivision related.
      6.   The City of Sidney shall not be responsible if improvements or
alterations must be eradicated, moved, repaired, or rebuilt due to an applicant
making improvements prior to and/or not in accordance with the requirements of
these regulations or the conditions of preliminary approval. In such situations
the applicant may be subject to the enforcement provisions and penalties
described in chapter 12-1 of these regulations, and the restoration of any
resource that has been altered may be required as a condition of preliminary
plat approval.
   B.   Preliminary Plat Submittal:
      1.   The applicant shall provide all required preliminary plat elements
identified in chapter 12-5 of these regulations to the Administrator. The
application materials should address comments and questions raised during the
pre-application meeting, including information on potential adverse impacts to
agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural
environment, wildlife, wildlife habitat, and public health and safety,
including how these potentially significant adverse impacts will be avoided or
mitigated. If the development is proposed to be phased, the application must
provide information identifying all phases of the development, including a
schedule for when the applicant plans to submit for review of each individual
phase of the development.
         a.   When a subdivision is located in an incorporated area but
proposed to be annexed into a city or town, the applicant shall submit the
preliminary plat application to the Administrator for the city or town. The
municipal government shall review the preliminary plat and annexation
applications.
         b.   When a subdivision is located partly within a municipality and
partly within the unincorporated county, and only a portion of the property is
proposed to be annexed into the city or town, the applicant shall submit the
preliminary plat application to both the Administrator for the city or town and
the Administrator for the county. Both the municipal and county governing
bodies shall review and issue decisions on the application.
      2.   The applicant shall include all correspondence with utilities,
agencies and service providers identified through the pre-application process
with the preliminary plat application materials. It is recommended that the
applicant communicate with neighboring property owners early in the process to
address any potential concerns that may arise, and documentation of this
correspondence, if conducted, should be included with the preliminary plat
materials.
      3.   When a subdivision is proposed to deviate from any of the design
standards in chapter 12-7, the preliminary plat application must include a
request for variance in accordance with the requirements of chapter 12-5.
      4.   One a preliminary plat application has been submitted, the
Administrator, governing body, planning board, affected agencies and service
providers may investigate, examine, and evaluate the site of the proposed
subdivision to verify information provided by the applicant and to subsequently
monitor compliance with any conditions of preliminary plat approval until the
final plat is approved. The submission of a preliminary plat application
constitutes a grant of permission by the applicant.
   C.   Element Review:
      1.   Timeframe And Process: A preliminary plat application is considered
to be received on the date of delivery to the Administrator and when
accompanied by the proper review fee.
         a.   Within five (5) working days of receipt, the Administrator shall
determine whether the application contains all of the required elements listed
in chapter 12-5 and indicated during the pre-application meeting. The
Administrator shall provide written notice to the applicant of the
determination and identify any missing elements and the timeframe in which they
must be submitted.
         b.   When a missing element is submitted by the applicant, the five
(5) working day timeframe for review begins again. This process shall be
repeated until Administrator provides written notice to the applicant that the
application contains all required elements. If the applicant fails to submit
the required information within six (6) months, the application is terminated
and the applicant must reapply. The Administrator may grant one six (6) month
extension to this requirement.
      2.   If the applicant alters the preliminary plat application during
element review, the five (5) working-day review period is suspended and the
Administrator may require additional materials to clarify the proposed
amendment including but not limited to a revised application form, preliminary
plat, additional review fees, or documentation of potential impacts and
mitigate. The five (5) working-day review period resumes when the Administrator
notifies the applicant that the application contains all required elements
addressing the amendments proposed.
      3.   If the subdivision regulations change during element review, the
determination of whether the application contains the required elements shall
be based on the new regulations.
      4.   In the event a preliminary plat application differs so greatly from
the plans submitted at the pre-application stage, the Administrator may require
the applicant go through a new pre-application process reflecting the current
plans.
   D.   Agency Review:
      1.   Agency review may occur throughout the review process and may be
initiated by the applicant, the Administrator, or an agency representative.
Agency comments received at any time will be included in the files and records
for the subdivision. Comments will be included in the staff report, planning
board recommendation, and governing body decision.
      2.   After determining the application includes all required elements,
the Administrator shall provide a summary of the application and preliminary
plat to those utilities, federal, state, and local government agencies, and
service providers identified during the pre- application meeting. The
Administrator may also notify others who may have a substantial interest in the
subdivision such as a property owners association.
      3.   When the property to be subdivided lies within a rural school
district, the Administrator shall provide a summary of the information
contained in the application and preliminary plat to the rural school district
superintendent for distribution to the school district trustees for comment
(pursuant to section 20-9-615, Montana Code Annotated).
      4.   If during the review of the application, the Administrator contacts
a public utility, agency, or other entity that was not included on the list
originally made available to the applicant, the Administrator shall notify the
applicant of the contact and timeframe for response (pursuant to section 76-3-
504(1)(q)(iii), Montana Code Annotated).
      5.   The Administrator shall provide the applicant with copies of all
comments received.
      6.   If the applicant makes substantial changes to the application during
subsequent stages of the review process, the Administrator may seek additional
comments from agencies and others.
      7.   A public utility or agency review may not delay the governing body’s
action on the application beyond the time limits specified in this chapter, and
the failure of any agency to complete a review of an application may not be a
basis for rejection of the application by the governing body (pursuant to
section 76-3-504(1)(i), Montana Code Annotated).
      8.   If a federal or state government entity submits a written or oral
comment or an opinion regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural
environment, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body’s
written statement under section 76-3-620, Montana Code Annotated only if the
comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study that
supports the comment or opinion.
      9.   Federal or state entities that have been involved in an effort to
acquire or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property of the
proposed subdivision are required to disclose that information prior to
submitting comments, opinion, or information.
      10.   Coordination Between Counties And Municipalities:
         a.   When a proposed subdivision lies within one mile of a third-class
city or town, within two (2) miles of a second-class city, or within three (3)
miles of a first-class city, the Administrator shall submit the application and
preliminary plat to the city or town governing body or its designated agent for
review and comment (pursuant to section 76-3-601(2)(b), Montana Code
Annotated).
         b.   When any portion of a proposed subdivision is intended to be
annexed, the governing bodies of both the city and county shall coordinate
annexation and subdivision procedures to minimize duplication of hearings,
reports, and other requirements when possible. In general, it is recommended
that the city and county Administrators meet to discuss the proposed annexation
and subdivision, overlapping issues, and make a recommendation on coordination
to their respective governing bodies. The most coordinated approach is a joint
review, with one staff report prepared for both jurisdictions, joint planning
board hearings, and joint governing body meetings or hearings.
         c.   If joint review is not conducted, each jurisdiction may conduct
separate, concurrent reviews of the proposed subdivision application. If the
governing bodies of the city and county grant approval or conditional approval
of the subdivision to be annexed, the county shall approve the subdivision with
a condition of annexation, and the municipality shall approve the annexation
prior to approval of the subdivision application.
   E.   Sufficiency Review:
      1.   Timeframe And Process:
         a.   Within fifteen (15) working days of notifying the applicant that
the application contains all required elements, the Administrator shall
determine whether the application contains detailed, supporting information
that is sufficient to allow for a comprehensive review of the proposed
subdivision.
         b.   The Administrator shall provide written notice to the applicant
of the determination, identifying any deficiencies and information needed for
the application to be sufficient and the timeframe in which additional
information must be submitted.
         c.   When a missing element is submitted by the applicant, the fifteen
(15) working day timeframe for review begins again. This process shall be
repeated until Administrator provides written notice to the applicant that the
application contains detailed, supporting information that is sufficient to
allow for review of the application. If the applicant fails to submit the
required information within six (6) months, the application is terminated and
the applicant must reapply. The Administrator may grant one six (6) month
extension to this requirement.
      2.   If the applicant alters the preliminary plat application during
sufficiency review, the fifteen (15) working-day review period is suspended.
The Administrator shall determine whether the change materially alters the
application submittal and if so, may require additional materials to clarify
the proposed amendment including but not limited to a revised application form,
preliminary plat, additional review fees, or documentation of potential impacts
and mitigate. The fifteen (15) working-day review period resumes when the
Administrator notifies the applicant that the application is sufficient for
review.
      3.   If the subdivision regulations change during sufficiency review, the
determination of whether the application is sufficient shall be based on the
new regulations.
      4.   A determination that an application contains sufficient information
to allow for review does not ensure the application will be approved or
conditionally approved, nor does it limit the ability of the Administrator,
planning board, or governing body to request additional information during the
review process. A determination of sufficiency also does not limit DEQ, the
local sanitarian, or other agencies with permit authority to require additional
information during their reviews.
   F.   Application Review:
      1.   Once the application has been deemed sufficient, the local
government’s statutory review period for a decision begins. The review period
begins the day after the Administrator provides written notification to the
applicant that the application is sufficient for review. The timeframes in
which the governing body must make a decision to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the preliminary plat application are as follows:
         a.   Thirty five (35) working days for a minor subdivision;
         b.   Sixty (60) working days for a major subdivision with less than
fifty (50) lots; and
         c.   Eighty (80) working days for a major subdivision with fifty (50)
or more lots.
         d.   Sixty five (65) working days for an expedited subdivision.
      2.   The applicable review period may be extended or suspended by up to
one year upon mutual consent of the applicant and the Administrator. Amending
an application after it has been determined to be sufficient constitutes the
applicant’s consent to an extension of the review period. The review period is
also extended if a subsequent public hearing is required.
      3.   If the applicant changes the application after the Administrator
determines the application is sufficient for review but prior to the governing
body’s decision, the subdivision may be considered amended and require
additional consideration based on the following factors.
         a.   Clarifying information that is submitted in response to a
question posed by the Administrator, planning board, or governing body and
which does not constitute a material change to the application will not be
considered an amendment.
         b.   In determining whether a change is material the Administrator
will use the criteria identified in section
12-6-3. Within five (5) working days of receiving amendment materials the
Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing that:
            (1)   The change is not material and the review may proceed;
            (2)   The change is material, requiring a change to the staff
report, but the review may proceed; or
            (3)   The change is material and of such significance that the
application reverts back to sufficiency determination.
         c.   By amending the application, the applicant consents to a
suspension of the review period. The Administrator may extend the review period
by up to thirty (30) working days to allow for rescheduling a public hearing or
meeting, to provide public notice, or to amend the staff report as may be
necessary.
   G.   Staff Report:
      1.   The Administrator shall prepare a report evaluating the preliminary
plat application for compliance with these regulations. The staff report shall
contain:
         a.   A recommendation for approval, conditional approval (including
any conditions and mitigation measures), or denial of the preliminary plat
application;
         b.   A summary providing the basis for the recommendation including
findings of fact that describe the factual evidence and analysis of compliance
with the review criteria (chapter 12-5) and submittal requirements (chapter 12-
6) ;
         c.   A summary of conditions of approval necessary to ensure
significant adverse impacts identified through the review process are mitigated
and to ensure compliance with state, local, and federal regulations, including
these regulations, prior to final plat approval;
         d.   A recommendation for approval or denial of any variance requests,
including any conditions of approval and a summary of facts forming the basis
for the recommendation;
         e.   An account of all agency and public comments received, including
those provided with the subdivision application materials.
      2.   The Administrator shall submit the staff report to the applicant and
governing body at least five (5) working days prior to the governing body’s
meeting on the application for a minor subdivision. For a major subdivision,
the Administrator shall submit the staff report to the planning board and
applicant at least fifteen (15) working days prior to the public hearing.
   H.   Public Notice And Comment:
      1.   The Administrator shall be responsible for providing public notice
as follows:
         a.   All major subdivisions require a public hearing before the
planning board and a public hearing before the governing body (unless exempt
per section 76-3-616, Montana Code Annotated). Notice of the planning board
hearing shall be in conformance with the requirements of section 76-3-605(3),
Montana Code Annotated. For any additional meetings of the planning board or
governing body on an application, notice shall be posted a minimum of forty
eight (48) hours in advance in accordance with the policies of The City of
Sidney.
         b.   Minor subdivisions are considered at a public meeting of the
governing body where public comment shall be allowed. Notice of the meeting
must be posted a minimum of forty eight (48) hours in advance of the hearing in
accordance with the policies of The City of Sidney.
         c.   The Administrator may post notice of any public hearing related
to a proposed subdivision on the subject property and may also post notice of
the hearing and materials related to the application on the City of Sidney
website or other digital media.
      2.   Public comment will be accepted at any point in the subdivision
review process and at all public hearings and meetings. Comments received will
be considered in the staff report, planning board recommendation, and governing
body decision.
         a.   Written comments regarding the application shall be submitted to
the Administrator, who shall keep a record of comments and include them in the
files and records for the subdivision. The Administrator will transmit all
written public comments to the applicant and the planning board and governing
body, as applicable.
         b.   The planning board and governing body will review and consider
all public comments prior to making a recommendation or decision on the
application.
         c.   Following preliminary approval and when DEQ or local sanitation
approval is required, the applicant shall, as part of the application for
sanitation approval, forward a summary comments to the sanitation reviewer.
   I.   Planning Board Hearing And Recommendation:
      1.   The planning board shall review, hold a public hearing, and make a
recommendation on all major subdivisions except those exempted under section
76-3-616, Montana Code Annotated. The planning board delegates the
responsibility for reviewing minor subdivisions to the Administrator.
      2.   Public Hearing Requirements:
         a.   The planning board shall hold a public hearing separate from the
governing body’s public hearing on all major subdivisions, with public notice
provided as described in subsection H above.
         b.   Public hearings shall be conducted as provided in the City of
Sidney Growth Policy.
         c.   Unless otherwise established in the City of Sidney Growth Policy,
the planning board shall conduct all business on the subdivision during the
public hearing or if necessary, continue the hearing to another date. Notice of
the continued hearing must be posted at least forty eight (48) hours in
advance.
         d.   When a major subdivision is exempt from planning board review
pursuant to section 76-3-616, Montana Code Annotated, but requires a variance
to these regulations, a separate public hearing shall be required to consider
the variance request only.
      3.   Planning Board Consideration And Recommendation: The planning board
shall evaluate the proposed subdivision under the review criteria in chapter
12-5, taking into consideration the preliminary plat application, staff report,
variance request (when applicable), any additional information submitted and
all public comments received. The planning board shall make a recommendation to
the governing body to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the subdivision
based on established findings of fact that support the recommendation. The
board’s recommendation shall be provided in writing to the applicant and the
governing and include:
         a.   Recommended findings of fact that describe the factual evidence
and analysis of compliance with the submittal requirements and review criteria;
         b.   Recommended conditions and mitigation measures;
         c.   Disclosure of any preferences for mitigation expressed by the
applicant to the planning board;
         d.   A recommendation for approval or denial of any variance requests,
including any conditions of approval and a summary of facts forming the basis
for the recommendation;
         e.   An account of all agency and public comments received during the
public hearing process;
         f.   The staff report as submitted to the planning board; and
         g.   Meeting minutes.
The Administrator shall compile the items listed above following the planning
board hearing and submit the materials to the planning board chair for
approval. Once approved, the Administrator shall submit the package to the
governing body and applicant within ten (10) working days.
   J.   Governing Body Meeting Or Hearing And Decision:
      1.   The governing body shall review, hold a public hearing, and make a
determination on all major subdivisions except those exempted under section 76-
3-616, Montana Code Annotated. The governing body shall hold a public meeting
on all minor subdivisions pursuant to these regulations and section 76-3-609(2)
(e), Montana Code Annotated.
      2.   Public Meeting And Hearing Requirements:
         a.   The governing body shall hold a public hearing separate from the
planning board’s public hearing on all major subdivisions, with public notice
provided as described in subsection H above.
         b.   Public hearings shall be conducted as provided in the City of
Sidney Growth Policy.
         c.   Unless otherwise established in the City of Sidney Growth Policy,
the governing body shall conduct all business on the subdivision during the
public hearing or if necessary, continue the hearing to another date. Notice of
the continued hearing must be posted at least forty eight (48) hours in
advance.
         d.   When a major subdivision is exempt from review pursuant to
section 76-3-616, Montana Code Annotated but requires a variance to these
regulations, a separate public hearing shall be required to consider the
variance request only.
      3.   Required Mitigation Of Impacts:
         a.   The governing body may require mitigation measures through
conditions to minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified under
the review criteria in chapter 12-5. When requiring mitigation, the governing
body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner’s ability to develop land.
         b.   The governing body shall consult with the applicant and shall
give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the applicant.
The applicant shall express preferred mitigation no later than at the governing
body’s hearing or meeting; it is recommended the applicant submit mitigation
measures as early in the review process as possible to allow for proper
consideration.
         c.   The governing body is not required to accept the applicant’s
preferred mitigation. In some instances, the impacts of a proposed development
may be unacceptable and shall preclude approval of the subdivision.
      4.   New Information Submitted:
         a.   If new information is presented at the governing body’s hearing
for a major subdivision, the governing body shall consider the new information
in accordance with the criteria set forth in chapter 12-6 to determine if the
information represents or results in a material change to the proposed
subdivision.
         b.   If the information or analysis of information was presented at
the planning board hearing and the public has had a reasonable opportunity to
examine and comment on the new information, the governing body shall proceed
with its decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed
subdivision.
         c.   When new information, comments, or documents are presented
following the planning board public hearing, and the information or analysis of
information has never been submitted as evidence or considered by the planning
board at a hearing on the application, the governing body may:
            (1)   Approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application
without basing its decision on the new information if the governing body
determines the information is either irrelevant or not credible; or
            (2)   Direct the planning board to schedule a subsequent public
hearing for consideration of only the new information that may have an impact
on the findings and conclusions that the governing body will rely upon in
making its decision on the proposed application.
         d.   When a subsequent public hearing is required, the review period
is suspended. The new hearing shall be noticed according to the applicable
requirements of these regulations and be held within forty five (45) days of
the governing body’s determination to schedule a new hearing.
         e.   The Administrator shall provide to the planning board a
compilation of the new information, an addendum to the staff report that
addresses only the new information, and any recommended changes to the planning
board’s previous recommendation and findings of fact resulting from the new
information.
         f.   The planning board shall consider only the new information,
taking into consideration the staff report addendum and any comments and
information received at the subsequent public hearing. Within ten (10) working
days after the subsequent public hearing, the Administrator shall submit in
writing to the applicant and governing body any changes to the materials
required in subsection I3 above.
         g.   The governing body shall hold a public hearing after receiving
the planning board’s revised recommendation based on the new material
submitted. Notice of the governing body hearing must be posted a minimum of
forty eight (48) hours in advance of the hearing. The applicable review period
resumes at the time of the scheduled hearing.
      5.   Governing Body Consideration And Decision:
         a.   The governing body’s decision to approve, conditionally approve,
or deny a proposed subdivision shall be based upon an evaluation of the
subdivision application, preliminary plat, environmental assessment, staff
report, findings of fact, public comment, planning board recommendation, and
any additional information provided by the applicant. The requirements for
approving, approving with conditions, or denying an application are specified
in chapter 12-5 and are the same criteria considered in the staff report and
planning board recommendation.
         b.   When an applicant requests a variance, the governing body shall
review the request for compliance with the variance criteria in chapter 12-6,
taking into consideration the written request submitted by the applicant,
public comment received, planning board recommendation, staff report, findings
of fact, and any additional information pertinent to the request. The governing
body shall review and make a determination on the variance request prior to
making a decision on the preliminary plat application.
         c.   The governing body shall provide record of their decision to the
applicant, in writing pursuant to section 76-3-504(1)(r), Montana Code
Annotated, along with supporting materials to include the following:
            (1)   A summary of the decision to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the preliminary plat application, dated and with the
appropriate signature of the governing body;
            (2)   A list of the conditions that apply to preliminary plat
approval that must be satisfied before the final plat may be approved,
accompanied by written findings in support of reasonable mitigation required to
address impacts;
            (3)   The effective time period of the preliminary plat approval;
            (4)   A summary of the decision to approve or deny any requested
variances, including any proposed conditions for approval, and a statement
describing the facts and conditions upon which the decision is based;
            (5)   Information on the appeal process for denial or imposition of
conditions;
            (6)   Findings of fact and conclusions that the governing body
weighed and relied upon in making its decision to deny or impose conditions and
reference documents, testimony, or other materials that form the basis of the
decision;
            (7)   Identification of the regulations and statutes that were used

Requests
12-5-1: PRELIMINARY PLAT APPLICATION REVIEW CRITERIA:
   A.   Information To Be Considered: The governing body’s decision to approve,
conditionally approve, or deny a proposed preliminary plat application shall be
based on review of the application, preliminary plat, applicable environmental
assessment, public hearing and comment, planning board recommendation, staff
report, and other information submitted or prepared in the review of the
application. As per section 76-3-608(10), Montana Code Annotated, findings of

subdivision meets the requirements of these regulations and the MSPA must be
based on the record as a whole.
   B.   Review Criteria: The basis for the governing body’s decision to
approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed subdivision shall be
whether the subdivision meets the requirements of the MSPA and these
regulations. The findings of fact shall include an evaluation of the following
criteria.
      1.   Compliance With These Regulations: The review is based on the
subdivision regulations in place at the time the application is determined to
contain sufficient information for review. Subdivisions that do not comply with
the folowing standards shall be denied, unless the requirement is made a
condition of approval or a variance is granted.
         a.   Design Standards: Compliance with provisions of the design
standards in chapter 12-7 is required.

(3)(b)(iii), Montana Code Annotated): All preliminary plat applications shall
be reviewed in compliance with the procedures established in these regulations
and the MSPA. The record shall demonstrate the review processes and timeframes

clerk and recorder.
      4.   Restriction On Encroachment Onto Adjoining Private Property (Section
76-3-608(8), Montana Code Annotated): The governing body may not approve a
proposed subdivision if any of the features and improvements of the subdivision
encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
provided for under the Montana Sanitation in Subdivisions Act or these
regulations or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled
for the proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless
the owner of the private property authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes
of this section, “well isolation zone” has the meaning provided in Section 76-
4-102, Montana Code Annotated.
      5.   No Denial Solely For Education Or Wildland Urban Interface (Section
76-3-608(1), Montana Code Annotated): The governing body may not deny a

period time limits provided in these regulations and may not deny a preliminary
plat application due to failure of any public utility or agency to provide
comments on the application. (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-5-2: FINAL PLAT APPLICATION REVIEW CRITERIA:
   A.   Information To Be Considered: The governing body’s decision to approve

of any legal agreements or contracts by the city/county attorney, and other
information submitted or prepared in the review of the final plat application.
   B.   Review Criteria: A final plat shall not be approved for filing unless
the final plat application demonstrates compliance with the following criteria.
      1.   No Material Change To The Preliminary Plat And Plans: There shall be
no material changes to the approved preliminary plat and related materials
except for the following circumstances:
         a.   When changes are specifically required by conditions of approval.
Material changes in the site layout, subdivision design, or to the plat for DEQ
or other agency approval or other required permits do not constitute an
exception unless a condition specifically authorizes the change.
         b.   If the administrator determines a condition of approval is
illegal or impossible to comply with due to circumstances outside of the
subdivider’s control, economic hardship notwithstanding, the condition may be
reviewed by the governing body through a public hearing with notice provided as
per section 76-3-605(3), Montana Code Annotated in order to determine if the
condition may be waived or amended.
Unless the change is one described in the two previous paragraphs, a final plat
with a material change, as described below under Criteria for Amending
Applications, shall be denied until it is brought into compliance or only has
changes that are not material.
      2.   Compliance With Conditions Of Approval (Section 76-3-611, Montana
Code Annotated): The final plat application shall demonstrate compliance with
all conditions of approval.
      3.   Subdivision Guarantee And Lienholders Consent (Section 76-3-612,

Annotated): The final plat shall include the county treasurer’s certification
that all real property taxes and special assessments assessed and levied on the
land to be subdivided have been paid.
      6.   Examining Land Surveyor Approval (Section 76-3-611(2), Montana Code
Annotated): The governing body may require the final subdivision plat to be
reviewed for errors and omissions in calculation and drafting by an examining
land surveyor before recording with the county clerk and recorder. No final
plat shall be recorded unless the plat includes a certificate of compliance
signed by the examining land surveyor. (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-5-3: CRITERIA FOR AMENDING SUBDIVISION APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Applicability: Changes to a preliminary or final plat application after
submittal triggers review as an amended application. Chapter 12-4 identifies
the steps to be taken when changes are made including:
      1.   Amendments to the application during element review;
      2.   Amendments to the application during sufficiency review;
      3.   Amendments to the application after sufficiency but prior to
governing body decision; and

prior to final plat approval. Please note no material changes are allowed after
preliminary plat approval as per section 76-3-611, Montana Code Annotated. The
subdivider is advised that changes to the site layout for sanitation or other
purposes can be considered a material change, even when such changes are
required by an agency such as DEQ, that may issue an approval necessary for the
subdivision.
   B.   Review Criteria For Material Change: If a subdivision application is
determined to have a material change, the application may revert to an earlier
stage in the review process. The criteria for determining if a material change
has been made to an application are whether the change:
      1.   Significantly alters the layout or design of the subdivision;
      2.   Negatively impacts agriculture, agricultural water user facilities,
local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife habitat, or public
health and safety in ways not previously identified or reviewed;
      3.   Requires a variance from a design standard; or
      4.   Significantly impacts other aspects of the subdivision in ways not
previously identified or reviewed.
   C.   Examples Of Material Change: The following are examples of potential
material changes. These are examples only and not an exhaustive list.

sanitation systems;
      4.   Parkland Or Open Spaces: Relocation of parkland or reduction in
acreage, and
      5.   Easements: Change in location, width, or purpose of easements. (Ord.
591, - -2021)
12-5-4: CRITERIA FOR CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS TO FINAL PLATS:
   A.   Changes To Approved Final Plats Prior To Filing: No changes are allowed
to an approved final plat prior to filing with the clerk and recorder.
   B.   Changes To Filed Final Plats: Changes that alter any portion of the
filed must be made by filing an amended plat showing all alterations. The
criteria for amending a final plat are the following:
      1.   Survey Corrections: Survey corrections shall be reviewed according
to the survey requirements under Part 4 of the MSPA and do not require review
as a subdivision. The governing body may also correct a final plat when it does
not definitively show the location or size of lots or blocks or the location or
width of any street or alley, as provided in section 76-3-614, Montana Code
Annotated.
      2.   Boundary Relocations And Aggregations Of Lots In A Platted
Subdivision: Boundary relocations and aggregations involving five or fewer lots
within a platted subdivision shall be reviewed to determine if they qualify for
an exemption under section 76-3-207, Montana Code Annotated. Refer to chapter
12-2.
      3.   All Other Changes To A Final Plat: All other changes must be
reviewed as an amended subdivision following the process and other requirements
for a major or minor subdivision under these regulations. (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-5-5: VARIANCE REVIEW CRITERIA:
   A.   Applicability: The governing body may grant variances from the
requirements of chapter 12-7 Design and Improvement Standards when, due to
characteristics of the land proposed for subdivision, strict compliance with
the standards would result in undue hardship and would not be essential to the
public welfare. A variance shall not be granted if it would have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations.
   B.   Criteria For Approval: The criteria for approving variances are:

            (3)   Wildfire: Determination of wildland-urban interface (WUI)
fire concerns (and mitigation measures) shall be made by the fire department
authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) where the subdivision is located, the
county disaster and emergency services coordinator, and the administrator. The
determination shall be made with consideration of WUI areas officially adopted
by the governing body in the community wildfire protection plan, growth policy,
or other documents and recognizing WUI maps are typically at a broad scale
requiring refinement at the scale of subdivision plats.
            (4)   Improvements: Mitigation measures can be incorporated into
design plans by the subdivider.
            (5)   Mitigation For Lot Purchasers: A written plan to be approved
by the governing body prior to final plat approval that establishes how
mitigation measures are to be completed by lot purchasers will be required and
enforced.
            (6)   Notice: Lot purchasers shall be notified of no-build zone or
specific construction techniques or other mitigation measures that will be
required to eliminate or overcome identified hazards. Notice shall be made
according to the requirements of subsection
12-7-1J, “Notice to Lot Purchasers”. This notice shall be filed with the final
plat.
         d.   Waiver Of Requirements: When the hazard is located on the
subdivision property, requirements for mitigation may be waived if the hazard
area is delineated as a no-build zone on the final plat.
         e.   Mitigation Not Proposed Or Approved: When mitigation of the
identified hazard is not proposed, or when the subdivider’s proposed mitigation
is not approved by the governing body, the governing body shall determine if
the application should be denied, the mapped hazard identified as a no-build
zone or conditions of approval should be applied.
      4.   Applicable Plans: Plans applicable to hazards include the growth
policy, pre-disaster mitigation plan, and community wildfire protection plan.
   C.   Flood Hazards:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to reduce potential for
risks to public health and safety and property damage by setting limits for
construction and development in areas subject to flooding.
      2.   Applicability: This section applies to any subdivision with land
subject to flooding including lands within a one hundred (100) year floodplain
as shown on officially adopted floodplain maps, historically flooded lands, and
lands in proximity to a watercourse or drainway as those terms are defined in
the Montana Floodplain and Floodway Management Act.
      3.   Standards:
         a.   General Criteria:
            (1)   Base Flood Elevation And Boundary: The base flood elevation
and boundary of the one hundred (100) year floodplain area must be determined
and considered during subdivision review;
            (2)   Location Of Structures: Lots intended for development must
include suitable area for structures and supporting facilities (e.g.,
individual onsite wastewater treatment system) outside of the one hundred (100)
year floodplain;
            (3)   Surface Water Drainage: Adequate surface water drainage must
be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;
            (4)   Utilities: Public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems must be located and constructed to minimize
or eliminate flood damage; and
            (5)   Permits: Floodplain permits must be obtained before
development occurs that is within a regulated flood hazard area such as a one
hundred (100) year floodplain.
         b.   Determining The Extent Of Flood Hazard Areas:
            (1)   Areas Identified On Floodplain Maps/In Floodplain
Regulations: In areas where base flood elevations exist as part of flood
studies and maps established by FEMA or DNRC, the flood hazard area shall be
the area where the base flood elevations intersect site-specific surveyed
ground elevations. In areas where no base flood elevations are known, the
subdivider is responsible for the studies and surveys addressed below under
“Methodology for Determining Base Flood Elevations.” Note: These areas would
also require a Letter of Map Revision to the submitted to FEMA per 44 CFR 65.3.
Note: If the property owner believes the subject property has been
inadvertently included in a one hundred (100) year floodplain, the property
owner may have elevation provided by an engineer and seek an amendment to the
floodplain map. (See below.)
            (2)   Area With Watercourse Not Identified On Floodplain Maps Or
Regulations: If the administrator determines the property contains area with a
watercourse that has the potential for flooding to impact the subdivision and
that is not identified on official floodplain maps or in locally adopted
floodplain regulations, the area subject to flooding shall be determined by
either option 1 or 2 below:
               (A)   Option 1: The flood hazard area shall be the area:
                  i.   Within two thousand (2,000) horizontal feet and less
than twenty (20) vertical feet above the ordinary high-water mark of a
watercourse draining an area of twenty (20) square miles or more; or
                  ii.   Within one thousand (1,000) horizontal feet and less
than ten (10) vertical feet above the ordinary high-water mark of a watercourse
draining an area between ten (10) and twenty (20) square miles.
               (B)   Option 2: The flood hazard area shall be the area where
the base flood elevations intersect site-specific surveyed ground elevations.
Base flood elevations shall be determined according to the “Methodology for
Determining Base Flood Elevations” below.
            (3)   Methodology For Determining Based Flood Elevations: The
subdivider shall provide to the subdivision administrator, floodplain
administrator, and Floodplain Management Section of the Water Resources
Division of DNRC the base flood elevations and the one hundred (100) year
floodplain boundaries, and include a written narrative methodology, and data
and calculations used to determine the base flood elevations. The evaluation
must be performed by a professional engineer experienced in this field of work.
The governing body may request DNRC Floodplain Management Section personnel to
review and comment on the adequacy of the methodology, data, and results of the
effort to determine base flood elevations on the property. If DNRC personnel
are unable to provide a written review, the governing body or floodplain
administrator may require the subdivider to pay the actual costs for
independent peer review of the adequacy of the methodology, data and results of
the study.
         c.   Design Standards: There shall be no building, new development, or
artificial obstructions including structures, roads, or bridges with the flood
hazard area unless and until all appropriate permits are obtained.

natural area used for passive recreation such as sitting on a park bench
overlooking the area.
         c.   Location Of Land Donation: The governing body may approve land
for parks and recreation inside or outside of the subdivision.
         d.   Governing Body Determination Of Land Or Cash Donation: The
governing body, in consultation with the subdivider and planning board or parks
board, may determine suitable locations for parks and playgrounds and, giving
due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the subdivider, may
determine whether the park dedication must be a land donation, cash donation,
or combination. When a combination of land and cash donation is required, the
cash donation may not exceed the proportional amount not covered by the land
donation.

shall waive the parkland dedication requirement if it determines that:
            (1)   The preliminary plat provides for a planned unit development
or other development that permanently sets aside land for park and recreational
uses sufficient to meet the needs of the persons who will ultimately reside in
the development; and the area of the land and any improvements set aside for
park and recreational purposes equals or exceeds the area of the dedication
required per subsection G3a above, “Dedication of Parkland or Cash Donation;”
            (2)   Protection Of Lands For Other Purposes: The preliminary plat
will provide for the long-term protection of critical wildlife habitat;
cultural, historical, or natural resources; agricultural interests; or
aesthetic values; and the land area set aside for this purpose is equal to or
exceeds the area that would have had to be dedicated per subsection G3a above,
“Dedication of Parkland or Cash Donation;”
            (3)   Combination Of Parklands And Other Land Protection: The land
is proposed to be dedicated to a combination of park, recreation, or other uses
and is equal to or exceeds the area required subsection G3a above, “Dedication
of Parkland or Cash Donation;” or
            (4)   Parkland Outside Of The Subdivision: The subdivider provides
for land outside of the subdivision to be set aside for park and recreational
uses sufficient to meet the needs of the persons who will ultimately reside in
the subdivision; and the area of the land and any improvements set aside for
park and recreational uses equals or exceeds the area of dedication required
per subsection G3a above, “Dedication of Parkland or Cash Donation.”
         i.   Optional Waiver: The governing body may approve lands that are
within or outside of the subdivision for other uses as described in subsection
G3g, “Dedication to School District,” when the land to be set aside equals or
exceeds the dedication required per subsection G3a above, “Dedication of
Parkland or Cash Donation.”

12-7-6: TRANSPORTATION:
   A.   This section is designed to:
      1.   Ensure the design of streets, roads, pedestrian pathways and
bikeways conform to the recommendations of the growth policy;
      2.   Provide for the safety of both motorized and non-motorized traffic;
      3.   Provide for livable residential and retail commercial environments;
      4.   Provide economy of land use, construction, and maintenance, and
      5.   Provide safe and efficient access to property.
   B.   This section promotes narrower street widths and greater connectivity.
The intent is to more efficiently disperse traffic, protect pedestrians from
high vehicular speeds, reduce stormwater runoff, protect water quality, and
provide cost savings for developers and home buyers.
   C.   Roads – Functional Classification: Roads and streets are categorized
hierarchically by function and capacity. Capacity is often expressed as Average
Daily Traffic (ADT) or Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT). The major road
classes in the United States are freeways, arterials, collectors, and local
roads. For purposes of these subdivision regulations, the classification system
below shall apply.
   D.   Design Components By Functional Classification: Roads within the
subdivision shall conform to the standards as more fully described in the
following sections.
      1.   Functional Classifications:
         a.   Two (2) Lot Road: This type of road is allowed for up to two (2)
residential lots with no direct access from an existing road, subject to the
following:
            (1)   Two (2) Lot Roads are allowed in a zoning district that
limits development to one dwelling unit per lot. In areas without such zoning,
road access to two (2) residential lots is subject to residential lane
classification (below). Subdividers who voluntarily place a restriction of one
dwelling unit per lot on the face of the plat, buy/sell agreements, covenants,
and deeds shall qualify for two (2) lot roads.
         b.   Alleys: Alleys provide access to the side or rear of individual
land parcels. They may be required in urban areas to continue existing
development patterns, when a water or sewer authority desires separation
between infrastructure, or when a public service entity or agency desires
access to the rear of the lot.
         c.   Residential Lanes: This road type is allowed for residential
subdivisions of five (5) or fewer lots, subject to the following:
            (1)   The subdivision is in a zoning district with regulations that
limit the subdivision area to not more than two (2) dwelling units per lot. In
areas without such limitations, subdividers who voluntarily place a limit of
two (2) dwelling units per lot on the plat, buy/sell agreements, covenants, and
deeds shall qualify for residential lane roads.
            (2)   If the criteria for residential lane roads are not met, the
road access will be subject to local road standards.
         d.   Local Roads: This type of road is intended to primarily serve
residential development. Commercial and industrial subdivisions with projected
traffic volume of less than or equal to four hundred (400) ADT shall design to
the subcollector standard, except as noted below.
         e.   Subcollectors: This road type is not intended for direct access
to residential lots, but may provide access for commercial, public facilities,
and other uses.
         f.   Collectors: This road type is not intended for direct access to
residential lots, but may provide access for commercial, public facilities, and
other uses.
         g.   Arterials: This road type is the highest road classification
discussed in these regulations, carrying the most vehicles at the highest
speeds. Few subdivisions will include internal arterials except as extensions
of existing facilities across the subdivision. Existing roads leading to a
subdivision may require upgrades to this classification.
      2.   Number Of Residential Lots:
         a.   Two (2) Lot Roads: Limited of one dwelling unit per lot either
via zoning regulations or voluntary restrictions by the subdivider.
         b.   Residential Lanes: Limited to no more than five (5) lots with no
more than two (2) dwelling units per lot either via zoning regulations or
voluntary restrictions by subdivider.
         c.   Local Roads, Subcollectors, Collector And Arterial: These roads
have standards reflective of ADT rather than number of lots.
      3.   Average Daily Traffic:
         a.   Average daily traffic (ADT) is the daily volume of vehicular
traffic averaged over the course of a year. The ADT is the maximum standard for
the road based on traffic type.
         b.   For roads other than two (2) lot roads, alleys, and residential
lanes, the following shall apply:
            (1)   ADT shall be calculated on the use with the highest level of
road impact allowed within the zoning district. If the subdivision is not
within a zoning district that sets allowable uses, ADT shall be calculated on
the most impactful range of use common in the area or projected to occur, based
on discussion with the administrator.
            (2)   Subdividers who voluntarily restrict use to a specific type
or types through zoning or other means may base ADT and subsequent road design
on that basis, provided the restriction is revocable only with consent of the
governing body and is included on the plat, buy/sell agreements, covenants and
in deeds.
         c.   Roads that can reasonably be expected to serve additional ADT in
the future may, at the discretion of the governing body, be required to be
designed to meet the functional classification of the additional ADT. Further,
the governing body may require the subdivider to build the road to the
anticipated future standard. For such improvements the subdivider shall only be
required to pay the amount equal to the requirements of the subdivision. Refer
to subsection G5 below for how to calculate the subdivider’s share.
      4.   Design Speed:
         a.   This is the intended maximum driving speed in miles per hour. The
road shall be designed to facilitate this speed and not higher speeds.
         b.   Arterials: Design speed for arterials depend on a variety of
factors including projected ADT, existing and proposed traffic control devices,
frequency of stop signs and stop lights. In no case shall an arterial, other
than a state or federal highway, have speed limit greater than the highest
speed limit for the local jurisdiction’s roads.
      5.   Road Right-Of-Way And Easement Width:
         a.   Road right-of-way includes the minimum right-of-way widths that
would be dedicated and deeded to a local government (typically a municipality)
and easement widths, which conveys rights but do not transfer ownership (more
typical of unincorporated areas).
         b.   The dimensions are in feet and are the minimum starting point for
determining final width of the right-of-way or easement. Final width depends on
the number of travel lanes and parking lanes as well as the size of storm
drainage areas, pedestrian facilities, snow removal needs, utilities, and
topography.
      6.   Travel Lanes: This refers to the minimum number of travel lanes
required. The road shall be designed to include any turn lanes that may be
required to ensure road safety.
      7.   Parking Lanes:
         a.   This refers to the minimum number of on-street parking lanes.
         b.   Parking lanes are not allowed for alleys in residential areas.
         c.   “As Needed” is determined as follows:
            (1)   Within municipalities and growth areas, parking lanes shall
be included if they are required in locally adopted road standards.
            (2)   When a subdivision road is a continuation of an existing
road, the subdivision road shall at a minimum provide right-of-way or easement
area for parking lanes similar to those on the adjoining existing road.
            (3)   Subdividers shall identify proposed use of lots and determine
the number of parking spaces required as subsection F4 below. The subdivider
shall identify location of the required parking spaces as either off-street,
on-street, or a combination of both. If off-street parking is proposed, the
subdivider shall follow requirements of subsection F4.
            (4)   Parking lanes shall be a minimum of eight feet (8') wide and
twenty four feet (24') long.
            (5)   On-street parking is not permitted on arterial roadways.
      8.   Travel Surface Width: This is the minimum width in feet allowed for
the road surface. It is also the maximum width desired for residential areas
under normal conditions. The travel surface is the total width of the travel
lanes and does not include parking lanes, shoulders, or curb and gutter.
      9.   Travel Surface Type:
         a.   “Context-Dependent or Gravel”: This applies to two (2) lot roads
and residential lanes.
            (1)   At a minimum the road shall be gravel surfaced. If the road
providing access to the subdivision is a higher standard, the adjoining
subdivision road surface shall be built to the higher standard.
            (2)   Exception for rural two (2) lot roads and residential lanes
in low density areas outside of municipalities, growth areas, and rural
communities. In low density rural areas, two (2) lot roads and residential
lanes may be gravel even if they adjoin a paved road, but shall be required to
pave the first fifty feet (50') to prevent gravel from degrading the pavement
on the existing road.
         b.   “Context Dependent Or Paved”: This applies to local roads. The
requirement is for these to be paved, but in areas where similar properties are
unpaved, the road shall be built to a gravel road standard at a minimum.
         c.   “Paved”: This applies to subcollectors, collectors, and
arterials. Roads that are required to be paved either as subcollectors,
collectors, or arterials, or by “context” for lower classification roads, shall
be built to the following standards or to the paved standard of the adjoining
road, whichever is the higher standard.
            (1)   Roads not requiring curb and gutter must at a minimum be
chip-sealed.
            (2)   Roads requiring curb and gutter must at a minimum be asphalt.
         d.   Refer to the “Road Construction Specifications” section for
detailed standards for gravel and paved roads.
         e.   If the road providing access to the subdivision does not meet the
standards for its functional classification, refer to subsection G5 regarding
substandard roads leading to a subdivision.
      10.   Shoulder Width: Shoulder width, expressed in feet, is the minimum
shoulder width and applies to:
         a.   Gravel roads and paved roads without curb and gutter.
         b.   Roads With Paved Road, Curb, And Gutter: The shoulder width shall
be added to the width of the travel surface and included in the total curb-to-
curb width. Roads with curb and gutter must have a minimum width of twenty feet
(20') for fire protection access.
      11.   Shoulder Surface: The shoulder surface is context-dependent and
varies with the type of road surface and the storm drainage system as follows:
         a.   Paved roads with curb and gutter shall have paved shoulders.
         b.   Paved Roads Without Curb And Gutter:
            (1)   Paved shoulder is required in municipalities and growth areas
if required by local road standards, or if adjoining roads have paved
shoulders.
            (2)   Graveled shoulder for all other paved roads without curb and
gutter.
         c.   Gravel roads shall have gravel shoulders.
      12.   Road Pull-Outs For Fire Department Equipment: Where the road travel
surface is twenty feet (20') or less in width and where curves, hills, or
vegetation may obstruct views of oncoming traffic, there shall be areas for
fire department equipment to pull to the side of the road. Pull-out areas must
provide space for a vehicle to safely move out of a traffic lane in order to
permit the passage of emergency or other types of vehicles. At a minimum, a
pull-out shall be a total width of twenty feet (20'), including road travel
surface, shoulders, and adjoining unobstructed area that allows a driver to
stop safely. The requirement and location of pull-outs shall be determined by
the local fire department.
      13.   Vertical Clearance: The minimum vertical clearance above the travel
surface is thirteen and one half feet (13.5'). This is the minimum clearance
for any obstruction including bridges or overpasses, tree limbs, or overhanging
rock features. For arterial roads, the vertical clearance shall follow American
Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards for
the design speed.
      14.   Unobstructed Width: This is the minimum unobstructed width in feet
for any obstruction including tree limbs that extend over the roadway.
      15.   Corner Radius:
         a.   Corner radius, also described as curb radius, measures the
sharpness of a corner at an intersection. A large curb radius increases the
distance a pedestrian must travel to cross the road. The measurement is
expressed in feet.
         b.   Generally, where a lower classification road intersects with a
higher classification road, the higher classification requirement applies.
         c.   In industrial subdivisions, the corner radius shall be designed
to meet the needs of projected vehicle types such as large semi-trucks and
trailers.
      16.   Centerline Radius:
         a.   A horizontal curve in a road can be a slow, smooth curve or a
sharp, angular curve. The sharpness of a curve is defined by its centerline
radius, expressed in feet. For example, a long, gradual curve may have a radius
of five thousand feet (5,000') while the curve at a driveway entrance may have
a much shorter radius, such as fifteen feet (15').
         b.   The first criterion is that all curves shall have the capacity to
carry the largest current or anticipated fire truck in the district serving the
subdivision. If none is specified by the AHJ, the minimum weight capacity shall
be seventy five thousand (75,000) pounds as identified in the International
Fire Code.
         c.   For arterial roads, the centerline radius shall follow AASHTO
standards for the design speed.
      17.   Minimum Stopping Sight Distance:
         a.   The stopping sight distance is the distance a vehicle travels
from the instant a driver sights an object to the point at which a braking
vehicle stops. Stopping sight distance is the sum of two distances: (1) the
distance traversed by the vehicle from the instant the driver sights an object
necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes are applied; and (2) the
distance needed to stop the vehicle from the instant brake application begins.
These are referred to as brake reaction distance and braking distance,
respectively. The faster the speed of the vehicle, the longer the distance is
needed to stop.
         b.   The stopping sight distance on a roadway shall be sufficiently
long to enable a vehicle traveling at the design speed to stop before reaching
a stationary object in its path.
         c.   Sight distance varies on level ground or on hills (vertical
curves). Stopping sight distance also varies with conditions such as night
driving conditions, rain, snow, and ice. The sight distance determination shall
be based on AASHTO standards and methodology for finished road contours.
         d.   For arterial roads, the sight distance shall follow AASHTO
standards for the design speed.
      18.   Minimum Intersection Sight Distance:
         a.   The operator of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall have
an unobstructed view of the entire intersection and an adequate view of the
intersecting roadway to permit control of the vehicle to avoid a collision.
         b.   For arterial roads, the intersection sight distance shall follow
AASHTO standards for the design speed and intersection configurations.
      19.   Maximum Grade: Maximum grade is the maximum slope of a road
expressed in percent. No grade shall be less than 0.5 percent. The minimum
cross-slope of a road shall be two percent (2%) and the maximum shall be four
percent (4%).
      20.   Block Length:
         a.   Block length is the maximum permitted length of blocks in feet.
Where expressed as a range, such as three hundred to six hundred feet (300'-
600'), the shorter block length of three hundred feet (300') applies to higher
density development (at least six (6) dwelling units per acre). The longer
block length of six hundred feet (600') applies to low density development
(three (3) to six (6) dwelling units per acre). Where expressed as “NA,” block
length does not apply – as in two (2) lot roads, residential lanes serving five
(5) or fewer lots (total ten (10) dwelling units) or local roads serving low
density development (one to two (1-2) dwelling units per acre).
         b.   Commercial And Industrial Blocks: Commercial blocks shall not
exceed six hundred feet (600') on any road types other than arterial unless the
subdivider provides evidence the proposed block length is in context with
adjoining or surrounding block lengths. Industrial blocks shall be designed to
fit the context of the area and to support the intended future uses although it
is recommended block lengths not exceed on quarter mile.
         c.   Arterials: Block length does not apply to arterials as classified
in these regulations, although it is recommended block lengths on developed
arterials not exceed on quarter mile.
      21.   Roadside Storm Drainage:
         a.   Drainage along roadsides is typically comprised of curbs and
gutters, swales, or a combination of both. The drainage along roadways shall
conform to local context. The word context means that the roadside drainage
system shall match the system of adjoining roads or include a swale as
described in this section, whichever is the higher standard.
         b.   All storm water drainage shall meet the requirements of
subsection
12-7-5D4, “Stormwater Drainage Standards.”
         c.   Curb And Gutter: If curb and gutter is required, it shall conform
to the curb and gutter requirements of the local jurisdiction or to the
standard of the adjoining road, whichever standard is higher. The curb and
gutter shall align with the curb and gutter system of the adjoining road.
         d.   Drainage Swales:
            (1)   Final determination of drainage swale width, depth, and
retention capacity for lots less than twenty (20) acres shall be made by
Montana DEQ. For lots larger than twenty (20) acres, swales shall meet local
health department standards or DEQ standards if the local health department
does not have written standards.
            (2)   Slopes of roadside swales shall not exceed a slope of four to
one (4:1) and shall be well rounded.
            (3)   Swales shall be designed and built to ensure flow.
            (4)   Stormwater drainage swales shall not function as irrigation
ditches.
            (5)   Swales on sustained grades can result in erosion to the swale
as well as the cut-to-fill transition. When sustained grades are present the
designer shall provide the following features:
               (A)   Cross drains and swale blocks to allow runoff to outfall
into a natural drainage.
         e.   If no viable outfall exists within a reasonable interval, check
structures shall be used to reduce flow velocities and corresponding erosion
potential. High density developments (more than six (6) units per acre) and
commercial or industrial developments may be required to extend a storm drain
if one is located within five hundred feet (500') of an existing storm drain
facility when the storm drain owner indicates available capacity and
willingness to accept the runoff.
      22.   Pedestrian Facilities Along Roads:
         a.   Pedestrian facilities along roads include sidewalks and paths.
Construction by the subdivider is based on a variety of factors, described
below in subsection D22d. “Context” means that an easement and possibly
construction may be required as follows.
         b.   No pedestrian facility or easement is required for:
            (1)   Two (2) lot roads;
            (2)   Low density residential lanes with no potential for future
pedestrian connectivity. Examples of no future pedestrian connectivity include
roads terminating at a natural barrier such as a rock face.
            (3)   Local roads with a maximum future density of two (2) dwelling
units per acre, serving less than ten (10) lots, and no potential for
pedestrian connectivity.
            (4)   Other roads that have no potential for future pedestrian
connectivity; or
            (5)   Internal roads serving industrial subdivisions.
         c.   Easements for pedestrian facilities are required for all other
roads with potential for pedestrian connectivity.
         d.   The subdivider shall construct pedestrian facilities for roads
requiring pedestrian easements (per subsection D22c above) when:
            (1)   Adjoining properties have pedestrian facilities;
            (2)   Local zoning or municipal street design standards require
sidewalks or pathways;
            (3)   Commercial lots are proposed;
            (4)   There is a need for safe access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping, adjoining neighborhoods, transportation and other community
facilities, or for the continuation of existing, planned, or reasonably
anticipated routes;
            (5)   When the area of the subdivision is included in an adopted
pedestrian or non-motorized plan that calls for pedestrian facilities; or
            (6)   The subdivision is within one-quarter mile of an existing
developed pathway.
         e.   Refer to subsection F6 below for additional construction
requirements for pedestrian facilities.
         f.   Pedestrian facilities shall be separated from roadways as
follows:
            (1)   Gravel Roads And Paved Roads With No Curb And Gutter: The
storm drainage swale and/or utility corridor shall separate pedestrian
facilities from the roadway edge. At a minimum separation shall be no less than
three feet (3').
            (2)   Paved Roads With Curb And Gutter: Separation shall be a
minimum distance of three feet (3') on local roads, five feet (5') on
subcollectors, collectors, and arterials.
         g.   Refer to subsection G2 below for information on width of
easements for pedestrian facilities.
      23.   Bike Lanes:
         a.   Bike lanes along roads may include individual bike lanes reserved
for bicyclists, combined with pedestrian paths, or striped as part of the road
system. Subdivisions are subject to bike lanes “As Required”.
         b.   Easements for bike lanes shall be required for:
            (1)   Local roads in accordance with an adopted non-motorized
transportation plan or bike plan (if such exists); and
            (2)   For subcollectors, collectors, and arterials (in all cases
unless precluded by an adopted non-motorized plan or bike plan).
         c.   Bike lanes shall be constructed for:
            (1)   Subcollectors, collectors, and arterials; and
            (2)   Local roads when adjoining properties have bike lanes, when
local zoning or municipal street design standards require bike lanes, or when
the area is included in an adopted plan and the subdivision is within ¼ mile of
existing bike lanes.
         d.   Bike lanes shall connect to and align with an adopted bike lane
plan (if such exists) and bike lanes on abutting property.
         e.   Bike paths not located on the road travel surface shall be
separated from the roadway as for pedestrian facilities (see subsection D22f
above.)
         f.   Refer to subsection F6 for additional construction requirements
for bicycle facilities.
         g.   Refer to subsection G2 for information on width of easements for
bicycle paths.
      24.   Street Lighting:
         a.   Subdivisions are subject to street lighting “As Needed,” as
described below. “NA” means that street lighting is not required.
         b.   “As Needed” street lighting is required for:
            (1)   Subdivisions where pedestrian facilities are to be
constructed. At a minimum lighting shall be provided at intersections. Light
fixture placement and spacing shall be in accordance with the jurisdiction’s
adopted lighting policy, if any.
            (2)   Subdivisions in jurisdictions with applicable street-lighting
requirements adopted by the governing body.
         c.   Street lighting is not required for two (2) lot roads unless
required by other ordinance adopted by the governing body.
         d.   Street lighting shall focus downward, avoid light trespass and
glare.
   E.   Connectivity And Access:
      1.   Connectivity: A well-connected road network spreads traffic
efficiently, provides greater opportunities for access by service and emergency
vehicles, and furthers pedestrian mobility by increasing the number of
destinations that can be reached by walking or biking.
         a.   General Standards For Connectivity: A proposed development shall
provide multiple direct connections in its local road system to and between
local destinations such as parks, schools, and shopping, without requiring the
use of collectors or arterials.
         b.   External Connections:
            (1)   Road Connections:
               (A)   Road Stubs And Temporary Turnarounds: To ensure future
road connections where a proposed subdivision abuts unplatted land or a future
development phase of the same subdivision, temporary turnarounds (road stubs)
shall be provided to provide access to abutting properties to logically extend
the road system into the surrounding area. All road stubs shall be provided
with temporary turn-arounds or cul-de-sacs and the restoration and extension of
the road shall be the responsibility of any future developer of the abutting
land. Easements or right of way shall be put in place as part of the final plat
to assure future connections.
               (B)   Roads within and contiguous to the subdivision shall be
coordinated with other existing or planned roads within the general area as to
location, widths, grades, and drainage.
               (C)   No new half-street rights-of-way are allowed. Where the
proposed subdivision abuts an existing half-street, the other half of the
street shall be platted.
               (D)   This section is not intended to require roads to project
into floodplains, bluffs, or other natural features or existing development
that has no accommodations for connection.
            (2)   Non-Motorized Connections: Where the local jurisdiction has
adopted a non-motorized plan, pedestrian plan, and/or bike plan that identifies
planned trails through a subdivision, separate from those along a roadway, the
subdivider is encouraged to establish an easement for the trail(s). Refer to
subsection
12-7-5G for a discussion of how a trails easement may qualify as parkland
dedication.
         c.   Internal Connections:
            (1)   Roads Ending In Permanent Turnaround:
               (A)   Applicability:
                  i.   Subcollectors, collectors, and arterials shall not end
in permanent turnarounds. By definition of their functional classification,
they are intended to route traffic from roads of lower classification.
                  ii.   Two (2) lot roads are allowed to end in permanent
turnarounds.
                  iii.   All other internal subdivision roads designed to
permanently end in turnarounds are prohibited except where it can be clearly
demonstrated by the subdivider that no other options are available due to
slopes in excess of twenty percent (20%), other topographic and environmental
considerations such as rivers, lakes, etc., or where parcel configuration does
not provide any alternative.
               (B)   The maximum length of a road ending in a permanent
turnaround is as follows:
                  i.   Not to exceed the length of blocks in subsection D20
above except where it can be clearly demonstrated by the subdivider that no
other options are available due to slopes in excess of twenty percent (20%),
other topographic and environmental considerations such as rivers, lakes, etc.,
or where parcel configuration does not provide any alternative.
                  ii.   Six hundred feet (600') in areas of extreme fire
hazard, with areas of "extreme fire hazard¨ as shown in an adopted plan or
where no such plan exists, as determined by the local fire AHJ.
                  iii.   One thousand feet (1,000') for all other settings in
the WUI.
                  iv.   Outside of areas designated as WUI by the local
jurisdiction, roads longer than one thousand feet (1,000') may be allowed if
approved by the local fire AHJ to have necessary pull-outs as described in
subsection D12, "Road Pull-Outs for Fire Department Equipment¨ and areas
sufficient for fire department trucks to safely turn around in the roadway. The
fire department shall approve locations of pull-outs and turn-around areas in
the roadway. Length of a road terminating in a turnaround shall be measured
from the point at which the road with turnaround intersects a road with two (2)
points of access onto a higher classification road.
               (C)   Design For Permanent Turnarounds:
                  i.   Dimensions are for travel surface only and do not
include additional right-of-way needed for snow storage or storm drainage.
                  ii.   Alternate designs may be approved if designed and built
in accordance with the most current edition of "A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets" by the American Association of State Highway
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and when approved by the local fire
protection authority.
               (D)   Provisions For Non-Motorized Connectivity: Roads ending in
permanent turnarounds shall provide for pedestrian and bicycle connections by
extending an easement for pedestrian access to the nearest road within or
adjacent to the subdivision.
      2.   Design And Configuration Of Road Access:
         a.   Primary Access Requirements - Generally: A primary access is a
main entry into and out of the subdivision. In an unincorporated area, the
access for all subdivisions with six (6) or more lots shall be from a highway
or county road or from a road with a functional classification of subcollector
or higher. In subdivisions providing for more than thirty (30) dwelling units,
the primary access shall be from a highway or county road or from a road with a
functional classification of collector or higher.

vehicular passage in emergency situations only. An emergency access road shall
not qualify as a primary access road for purposes of subsections C and D above.
            (2)   Emergency access ways must not be open to general vehicular
travel and must be provided with removable bollards, gates, or other means
approved by the AJH to restrict general vehicular access. Emergency access ways
may serve as pedestrian and bicycle pathways.
            (3)   Emergency access routes shall be identified on the plat with
notice of use restrictions. Emergency access routes that do not meet the
minimum design and construction standards of a local road shall also include on
the plat notice that the emergency access route may not be designed to
accommodate fire equipment.
         d.   Gates: No subdivision shall be designed in such a way that
prevents or inhibits public access by a gate or other method of obstruction on
any road within or accessing the subdivisions. Gated subdivisions shall not be
allowed.

within twenty feet (20') of an intersection (unless state-owned, in which case
state standards prevail).
            (7)   The governing body may require cattle guards to be placed
where a subdivision road meets a public or private road.
         b.   Approach Permits: The subdivider shall obtain approach or
encroachment permits for subdivision roads to access to public roads and state
highways prior to road construction. For subdivisions with direct driveway
access onto a state or local jurisdiction road, the subdivider shall provide
written verification from Montana Department of Transportation or the local
jurisdiction that a specific driveway approach has been approved or that the
lot has suitable location for an approvable driveway approach in the future.
      2.   Road Names And Signage:
         a.   Names: Names of new roads shall not duplicate names of existing
roads unless the new road continues or aligns with an existing road. All new

Section 02528 “Concrete Curb and Gutter.”
      6.   Construction Of Sidewalks, Pedestrian And Bike Paths: The type of
sidewalk or path (concrete, asphalt, aggregate, etc.) shall be based on the
context or as required in adopted plan (e.g., a concrete sidewalk on adjacent
property shall be continued on the subdivision property). The subdivider’s
engineer shall certify that the construction and materials are comparable to
adjoining paths and sidewalks. Where there are no standards for concrete
sidewalks, they shall be built to standards of MPWSS Section 02529 “Concrete
Sidewalks.”
      7.   Roads Crossing - Watercourse And Irrigation Facilities:
         a.   Permits Or Other Approval:

subdivider’s responsibility to obtain the necessary permits for watercourse
crossings prior to construction.
            (3)   All roads that intersect or cross water conveyance facilities
shall be agreed to in writing by the water users and/or water conveyance
facility’s authorized representatives.
         b.   General Standards For Design And Construction:
            (1)   Where local jurisdictions have adopted bridge or culvert
standards, those standards shall apply.
            (2)   Where separate standards apply to water conveyance
facilities, as determined by authorized representatives of the facilities,
those standards shall apply.
            (3)   Where there are no locally adopted bridge or culvert
standards or standards do not sufficiently describe design and construction,
the crossing shall be designed by an engineer to AASHTO standards for the
design speed and projected traffic of the bridge crossing.
            (4)   In addition to the three bullet points above, the following
standards for bridges and culverts shall apply.
         c.   Bridge Standards:
            (1)   Projected Future Traffic: Bridges shall be designed to
accommodate the level and type of traffic made necessary by the subdivision and
current users at the time of final plat. Projections shall be made using
methodology to be identified by the engineer and approved by the administrator.
At a minimum the projected future traffic should take into account traffic from
the proposed subdivision and from other future developments that would likely
utilize the bridge.
            (2)   Scouring: Bridges shall be designed to accommodate the scour
that occurs at the one hundred (100) year and five hundred (500) year flood
events.

least two feet (2') above the base flood elevation to help pass ice flows, the
base flood discharge, and any debris associated with the discharge.
               (B)   For water conveyance facilities, the bridge shall be at
least two feet (2') above the highest water flow for the facility and include
base flood discharge.
            (6)   Railings: Citing applicable AASHTO standards, the engineer
shall design railings to safely accommodate future projected motorized and non-
motorized traffic on the bridge.
         d.   Culvert Standards:
            (1)   Projected Future Traffic: Culverts shall be designed to
accommodate the width of the road needed to convey motorized, pedestrian and
bicycle traffic. Projections shall be made using methodology to be identified
by the engineer and approved by the administrator. At a minimum the projected
future traffic should take into account traffic from the proposed subdivision
and from other future developments that would likely utilize the bridge.
            (2)   Scouring: Culverts shall be designed to accommodate the scour
that occurs at the one hundred (100) year and five hundred (500) year flood
event.
            (3)   Load Capacity: Culverts shall be designed to carry an AASHTO
standard HS-20 or HL-93 load.
            (4)   Width:
               (A)   The road extending over the watercourse or water
conveyance facility shall at a minimum be the same width as the road on either
side of the culvert and sufficiently wide to safely accommodate pedestrians and

   G.   Rights Of Way, Easements, Off-Site Road Improvements, And
Responsibilities For Roads:
      1.   Road Dedication:
         a.   Municipalities: Streets in municipalities are typically dedicated
on the face of the plat to the public and accepted into the municipality as
parcels of land (right-of-way). In some cases municipalities may not wish to
accept additional roads. In that case the road may either be established as a
parcel to be owned by a property owners’ association or as an easement granted
to a property owners’ association or to the appurtenant property owners.
         b.   Counties: County roads in Montana are typically by easement,
where the property owners on either side of the road own to the centerline of
the road.
         c.   Dedication To Local Government: A road or street is not a
municipal or county road unless it has been expressly accepted by the governing
body on the face of the plat.
         d.   Other: When local governments do not accept a road dedication to
the public, the following statement shall appear on the final subdivision plat:
“The undersigned hereby grants unto each and every person, firm, or
corporation, whether public or private, providing or offering to provide
telephone, electric power, gas, cable television, water or sewer service, mail
and package delivery, public schooling, law enforcement, fire protection and
emergency medical services the right to joint use of an easement for the
provision of services and facilities including the right to travel on
subdivision roadways as well as for the construction, maintenance, repair and
removal of their lines and other facilities in, over, under and across each
area designated on this plat as an access and/or utility easement to have and
to hold forever.”
AND where appropriate:
“Roads identified as ‘stubs’ on this plat shall be extended provided the
parties creating the extension pay for the extension and road improvements
within [name of subdivision] needed to accommodate additional traffic. The
parties creating the extension shall also participate in facility maintenance
as provided for in the Road Maintenance Declaration filed with this plat.
      2.   Rights-Of-Way And Easements – Width And Location:
         a.   Road Rights-Of-Way And Easements: Road easements shall be
sufficient to accommodate the infrastructure required or anticipated for the
road including sidewalks, pedestrian and bicycle paths, snow storage, storm
drainage, and utilities including electricity, gas, telecommunications, water,
and sewer. These requirements vary from subdivision to subdivision. Road right-
of-way and easement widths shall be calculated using the minimum road width and
additional widths for other required facilities as identified.
         b.   Easements – Generally: No portion of a structure or other
obstruction shall be placed in easements described below with the exception of
cut and fill easements, which may include retaining walls and other soil
stabilization structures.
         c.   Municipal Urban Fringe Area/Growth Area: For subdivisions within
a municipal growth area as described in an adopted growth policy or other
document adopted by the governing body, the right-of-way shall provide enough
width to accommodate municipal infrastructure and correspond at a minimum to
the right-of-way for the anticipated municipal classification if the area is
annexed in the future. For municipalities without an adopted growth area map,
the growth area shall be considered as the area within one mile of a town or
third-class city, two miles of a second-class city, or within three (3) miles
of a first-class city.
         d.   Storm Drainage Systems: Storm drainage easements along roadways
shall accommodate the swale or other facilities as required by DEQ or when no
DEQ is required, the requirements in subsection F3.
         e.   Pedestrian And Bicycle Facilities: The bike and pedestrian
facilities must be separated from the roadway as follows:
            (1)   Gravel Roads And Paved Roads With No Curb And Gutter: The
storm drainage swale and/or utility corridor (refer to subsection G2a regarding
road-related utility easements) shall separate pedestrian facilities from the
roadway edge. At a minimum this shall be no less than three feet (3').
            (2)   Paved Roads With Curb And Gutter: Separation shall be a
minimum distance of three feet (3') on local roads, five feet (5') on
subcollectors, collectors, and arterials.
         f.   Snow Removal And Storage: Road easements shall provide adequate
width for snow removal and storage. Where snow cannot be stored safely within
the existing road easement, special areas for snow storage shall be designated
as easements either adjacent to the roadway or off-site.
         g.   Pull-Outs And Turn-Arounds For Fire Department Access: Where
pull-outs and turn-around areas are needed along the roadway, the right-of-way
and/or easement shall be adjusted as needed to incorporate these areas.
         h.   Cut And Fill Easements: Where a cut or fill area of a road is
outside of the normal right-of-way or easement, a slope easement of sufficient
width shall be required to allow maintenance of the cut or fill area.
         i.   Utility Easements: Water, Sewer, Gas, Electric, Telephone, Cable:
            (1)   Public or multi-user water and sewer systems are typically
placed in the road. If additional easement is needed outside of the road, the
easement shall be as prescribed in standards adopted by the local jurisdiction.
If none exist or have insufficient detail, width of easement shall be
determined in coordination with DEQ and the facility owner.
            (2)   Trenches for co-locating electric, telecommunications, and
gas shall be a minimum of eighteen inches (18") in width, unless otherwise
designated in writing by the utility companies. The easement may be located
within or outside of the road right-of-way or easement, unless otherwise
specified by standards adopted by the local jurisdiction or by utility
companies.
            (3)   Parallel separations shall be as follows:
               (A)   If a public or multi-user water or sewer system is
proposed, parallel separations for water supply, sewer, and storm drainage
facilities shall be as required by DEQ.
               (B)   Electric, telecommunications, and gas utilities shall be
separated from water supply systems by five feet (5'), from sewer systems by
ten feet (10'), and from storm drainage systems or irrigation facilities by
five feet (5'), unless otherwise designated in writing by the utility company.
      3.   Waiver Of Right To Protest Improvement District: Whenever a
subdivision includes easements or other provisions for infrastructure such as
sidewalks, bike paths, street lighting, etc. the subdivision plat shall include
a “Waiver of Right to Protest” the formation by the governing body of a special
taxing district to pay for the improvements. A template for such language is
included in Supplemental Administrative Materials.
      4.   Off-Site Easements:
         a.   Where access to the subdivision is other than from a public road
(or other road with clearly established public access) the subdivider shall
obtain easements of sufficient width to satisfy the requirements of this
chapter. Such easements must be granted in perpetuity by the parties to the
easement, in a signed and notarized document and be recorded prior to or
concurrent with final plat filing. Where the dedication of the existing
easement is unclear, the subdivider shall obtain the easement from those
persons owning lands crossed by the road.
         b.   The location of any road or utility easements used to access the
subdivision must be shown on the preliminary plat or on a supplemental map. The
existence of easements providing legal access to the subdivision shall be noted
on the face of the final plat and on any deeds or other instruments conveying
lots within the subdivision.
      5.   Substandard Municipal Or County Road Leading To A Subdivision:
         a.   General: When a substandard road is used to access a subdivision,
the governing body shall consider the two (2) options below for improving the
road and choose the option that in its estimation is most likely to result in
(A) improved safety and efficiency along the road and (B) equitable
distribution of the costs related to the extension of capital facilities. The
most obvious travel route due to convenience and destinations shall be used for
determining traffic flows and counts.
         b.   Option 1 (Generally For Major Subdivisions But May Be Applied To
Minors):
            (1)   Where a subdivision is accessed by a substandard road, the
subdivider shall be required to contribute to the local jurisdiction an amount
equal to the proportional share of the improvements necessary to bring said
road up to the standards for the relevant functional classification as
identified in these subdivision regulations.
            (2)   The cost of improvements shall be determined by a consulting
engineer who shall identify the road deficiencies and estimate materials, labor
and other cost items necessary to bring the road to the determined standard.
The consulting engineer shall be selected with approval from the administrator
and the jurisdiction’s public works director or road supervisor. Costs of the
consulting engineer shall be borne by the subdivider. Note: Typically the
subdivider’s engineer would provide this information.
            (3)   The subdivider’s proportional cost shall be found by adding
current ADT figures from the road to the projected ADT to be generated by the
subdivision, then dividing the projected subdivision ADT by the total. (Please
see the example below.) ADT shall be determined by recent counts by the
jurisdiction, if available, or by an independent agent to collect traffic count
data over a one week period, and may be required to be adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations. The independent agent shall be selected with approval from the
administrator and jurisdictions public works director or road supervisor.
Again, this would normally be the subdivider’s engineer. Costs are to be paid
by the subdivider. Traffic count locations shall be determined by the
administrator and public works director or road supervisor.
            (4)   As determined by the governing body, the subdivider’s funds
will either:
               (A)   Be deposited into an account held by the local
jurisdiction in a dedicated fund for the road improvements and will be used
only for improvements to the substandard road; or
               (B)   The developer will use the funds to make the specified
improvements to the substandard road prior to final plat filing or under an
improvements agreement.
         c.   Option 2 (Generally For Minor Subdivisions But May Be Applied To
Majors): Where a subdivision is accessed by a substandard municipal or county
road, as a condition of plat approval the governing body may require the future
lot owners to waive their right to protest the formation of a rural improvement
district related to access and drainage improvements that will benefit the
future owners.
      6.   Substandard Privately Maintained Roads Leading To A Subdivision:
Where a subdivision is accessed by a substandard road that is maintained
privately or by an entity other than the municipality or county, the subdivider
shall make all improvements that are necessary to bring that road up to locally
adopted standards, or the standards for the relevant functional classification
as identified in these subdivision regulations. The subdivider shall be
required to enter into a maintenance agreement so that the road is maintained
over time.
      7.   Payback Agreement: For improvements that a subdivider constructs
beyond those that are directly attributable to the subdivision, including those
used to access other unsubdivided or subdivided lands, the subdivider may
request a payback agreement in order to provide a mechanism for reimbursement
for a portion of the costs the subdivider incurs which are not directly
attributable to impacts caused by the subdivision. Payback funds would be
exacted from future subdividers and others who directly benefit from the
capital improvements.
      8.   Private Roads – Maintenance Declaration: Subdivisions with a new
road shall include a road maintenance declaration that shall be filed
concurrent with or prior to the final plat. The declaration shall only contain
items related to road maintenance, and include the following:
         a.   A description of the parcels subject to the agreement;
         b.   A description of the road(s) and appurtenant facilities,
including storm drainage, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, etc. that are
subject to the agreement;
         c.   Statement that the agreement is binding on any person having an
interest in a parcel that is subject to the agreement;
         d.   Extension of road “stubs” that extend to the property boundary
shall be allowed under the following circumstances:
            (1)   The cost of the extension is paid for by the party creating
the extension;
            (2)   The extension shall not result in incompatible traffic type,
such as semi-trucks in residential areas;
            (3)   The party creating the extension shall pay for improvements
to the road and related facilities (storm drainage, pedestrian-bike paths)
resulting from increased traffic due to the extension;
            (4)   The existing easements within the subdivision provide
adequate capacity for projected increases in traffic; and
            (5)   The properties served by the extension shall become parties
to this Road Maintenance Agreement, but may have reduced voting rights;
         e.   That any party providing public utilities, mail and package
delivery, public schooling and emergency and public safety services shall have
an easement over the road for such utilities and services;
         f.   That decisions to undertake any road, bicycle or pedestrian
facility maintenance and improvements are the responsibility of the owners of
the parcels subject to the agreement, and such decisions shall be based on a
majority vote of the parties to the agreement;
         g.   A description of who is eligible to cast a vote and the number of
votes per parcel;
         h.   A description of how the costs of maintenance will be assessed
(equally or disproportionally) against the parties to the agreement;
         i.   A description of how the amount will be assessed in the event a
party subdivides a parcel subject to the agreement;
         j.   A description of how the amount will be assessed in the event
outside parties (owners of lots outside of the subdivision) may be required to
use the road and pedestrian and bicycle facilities;
         k.   In the event that an assessment becomes delinquent, the
assessment and interest and the cost of collection shall become a continuing
lien on the parcel;
         l.   The agreement is perpetual and cannot be rescinded unless the
county, state or a municipality agrees to maintain the roadway and/or
pedestrian and bicycle facilities described in the agreement;
         m.   Maintenance shall include dust control, stormwater facilities,
traffic control devices, snow removal, ordinary upkeep, reconstruction and
pedestrian and bicycle facility installation, as applicable; and
         n.   The agreement may be amended, but only with the consent of the
governing body.
   H.   Condominiums: Design Standards: The design standards for condominiums
are the same as for all other subdivisions, as identified in chapter 12-7, with
the following additions.
      1.   No property shall bear a name using a word which is the same as,
similar to, or pronounced the same as a word in the name of any other property
or subdivision in the same county, except for the words “building”, “court”,
“place”, or similar words;
      2.   Off-street and guest parking shall be required in proximity to the
unit served;

total mobile home park area as surveyed for the site plan pursuant to
subsection
12-7-5G. These areas shall remain in private ownership and shall not be
dedicated to the public unless specifically accepted by the local governing
body. It shall be the responsibility of the mobile home park owner to maintain
the park and recreation area. The governing body may accept cash-in-lieu of
park dedication in circumstances where it is demonstrated park land is not
necessary to serve the mobile home park.
         l.   Mobile home parks located adjacent to industrial, commercial, or
lower-intensity residential land uses (e.g. single family residential) shall

Subdivision Improvements Agreement and financial guarantee. The Subdivision
Improvements Agreement is a contract between the subdivider and the governing
body designed to document the outstanding improvements, establish the estimated
cost and timeframe for completing the improvements, and provide a mechanism and
financial security for the governing body to install the improvements in the
event the subdivider fails to install them. A model Subdivision Improvements
Agreement is provided in the Supplemental Administrative Materials.

Improvements Agreement and provide comments and recommendations to the
governing body.
      2.   The Administrator shall review the Subdivision Improvements
Agreement to determine if all remaining improvements are addressed
sufficiently.
      3.   The governing body may also review or appoint a designee for
additional review.
      4.   Once the Subdivision Improvements Agreement, list of improvements,
amount, and form of the financial guarantee are sufficient for approval by the
governing body, the administrator shall provide written notice to the
subdivider.
   D.   Final Plat Application: The subdivider shall submit the final plat
application, including the Subdivision Improvements Agreement and required
financial guarantee, for consideration by the governing as part of the final

      3.   The governing body, Administrator, and approval agencies may inspect
any improvements at any time before, during, or after installation.
      4.   Field certification of installation at identified stages shall be
completed by the engineer unless another party is designated and approved in
the plans.
   F.   Administrative Review: Once partial improvements are determined to
comply with the requirements of the Subdivision Improvements Agreement and are
in compliance with the design standards and applicable conditions of approval,
partial release of funds will be made according to the provisions of the
Subdivision Improvements Agreement.
   G.   Completion of Improvements: Once all improvements are completed, the
improvements shall be certified according to subsection
12-8-2E.
   H.   Final Review And Approval:
      1.   The same process outlined in subsections C and D shall be followed
for final review and approval.
      2.   Once the installation and as-builts have been approved by all
agencies and the governing body, the governing body will issue final approval
and release of any required financial guarantee(s). (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-8-4: FINANCIAL GUARANTEES:
   A.   Financial guarantees shall comply with the following requirements:
      1.   Financial guarantees shall be in the form of a certificate of
deposit in the name of the governing body, an irrevocable letter of credit
redeemable only by the governing body, or cash.
      2.   The amount of the financial guarantee shall include:

estimated cost of completion of improvements to cover the cost of the governing
body having to complete improvements in the event the subdivider does not
finish the work. The governing body shall have the discretion to require up to
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of estimated completion costs during times of
rapid inflation of prices of materials, fuel, and labor.
         b.   The governing body will retain fifteen percent (15%) of the
financial guarantee to cover an anticipated one-year warranty period after work
has been completed and approved.
      3.   The expiration of the financial guarantee shall not be less than
fifteen (15) months from the date of approval of the completed improvements.
      4.   Requests for partial release of the financial guarantee shall only
occur after improvements are completed, certified by the subdivider and the
subdivider’s engineer as being built to the approved specifications, inspected
and accepted by the governing body, as-built drawings have been submitted (if
applicable), and after the adopted administrative review fee has been paid by
the subdivider or withheld from the release payment to the subdivider.
      5.   Requests for partial release shall only be in amounts such that the
financial guarantee will always equal at least the value of the uncompleted
work as per the approved cost estimate, plus the administrative fee and the
warranty amount.
      6.   After final completion, certification, inspection, and acceptance of
all improvements, and after expiration of the one-year warranty period when no
defects are found, the governing body shall return all remaining portions of
the financial guarantee to the subdivider along with a letter signifying final
completion of the subdivider’s obligations. (Ord. 591, - -2021)
12-8-5: EXTENDING CAPITAL FACILITIES:
   A.   The subdivider shall design and install all roads, sewer lines, water
supply lines, storm drainage, electrical and telephone utilities, fire
protection facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities and easements
necessary to serve the subdivision in accordance with these regulations.
   B.   The subdivider shall be responsible for one hundred percent (100%) of
the costs of providing these services to the subdivision but shall not be held
responsible for installing improvements that are not directly related to the
anticipated impacts of the subdivision or are disproportionate to the
anticipated impacts of the subdivision, as determined by the governing body.
   C.   In the event a subdivider is willing to install improvements with a
greater capacity than required by the subdivision, a payback agreement may be
developed and administered by the governing body to help the subdivider recover
up-front costs. (Ord. 591, - -2021)

CONTROL:        Sediment controls come into play after the damage from erosion has already impacted
                the site. Sediment control BMPs are not as effective as erosion control BMPs and are
                typically considered secondary practices installed after all opportunities for
                erosion control have been implemented. Examples of sediment control BMPs include:

                Geotechnical analysis usually uses principles of soil mechanics and rock mechanics
                to investigate subsurface conditions and materials; determine the relevant physical/
                mechanical and chemical properties of these materials; evaluate stability of natural
                slopes and man-made soil deposits; assess risks posed by site conditions; design
                earthworks and structure foundations; and monitor site conditions, earthwork and
                foundation construction. A typical geotechnical engineering project begins with a
GEOTECHNICAL    review of project needs to define the required material properties. Then follows a
ANALYSIS:       site investigation of soil, rock, fault distribution and bedrock properties on and
                below an area of interest to determine their engineering properties including how
                they will interact with, on or in a proposed construction. Site investigations are

                section 7-12-4102, Montana Code Annotated, in or for the benefit of the special
                improvement district.
                A parcel of land with two or more spaces available for rent or lease which are
RV PARK:        designated for temporary occupancy by recreational camping vehicles for camping and
                sleeping purposes.
RV SPACE:       A designated portion of a parcel of land designed for the temporary accommodation of
                one recreational camping vehicle and the exclusive use of its occupants.
SANITATION      Approval by the MT DEQ and/or local board of health for the aspects of subdivision
APPROVAL:       for water, sewer, solid waste and storm drainage.
                Removal of sediment such as sand and rocks from around bridge abutments or culverts.
SCOUR:          Scour, caused by swiftly moving water, can scoop out scour holes and compromise the
                integrity of a structure.
SECOND CLASS    An incorporated municipality with a population of less than ten thousand (10,000)
CITY:           and more than five thousand (5,000) (section 7-1-4111, Montana Code Annotated).
                Woven geotextiles placed between dissimilar materials, such as road aggregate and
SEPARATION      subgrade to stabilize the soil, preserve the aggregate and reinforce the surrounding
FABRICS:        soil. They will also keep mud below the rock from “pumping” up and help keep cleanup
                to a minimum.
                A septic system consists of two (2) main parts: a septic tank and a drainfield. The
                septic tank is a watertight box, usually made of concrete or fiberglass, with an
                inlet and outlet pipe. Wastewater flows from an inhabited structure to the septic
                tank through a sewer pipe. The septic tank treats the wastewater naturally by
                holding it in the tank long enough for solids and liquids to separate. The
                wastewater forms three (3) layers inside the tank. Solids lighter than water (such
                as greases and oils) float to the top forming a layer of scum. Solids heavier than
                water settle at the bottom of the tank forming a layer of sludge. This leaves a
                middle layer of partially clarified wastewater. The layers of sludge and scum remain
                in the septic tank where bacteria found naturally in the wastewater work to break
SEPTIC SYSTEM:  the solids down. The sludge and scum that cannot be broken down are retained in the
                tank until the tank is pumped. The layer of clarified liquid flows from the septic
                tank to the drainfield or to a distribution device, which helps to uniformly
                distribute the wastewater in the drainfield. A standard drainfield (also known as a
                leachfield, disposal field, or a soil absorption system) is a series of trenches or
                a bed lined with gravel or coarse sand and buried one to three feet (1' - 3') below
                the ground surface. Perforated pipes or drain tiles run through the trenches to
                distribute the wastewater. The drainfield treats the wastewater by allowing it to
                slowly trickle from the pipes out into the gravel and down through the soil. The
                gravel and soil act as biological filters (as defined by the National Environmental
                Services Center).
                Real property which has an easement or other use imposed upon it in favor of another
SERVIENT        property (called the “dominant estate”), such as an easement for access to an
ESTATE:         adjoining property or utility lines. The property giving usage is the servient
                estate, and the property holding usage of the easement is the dominant estate.
                The minimum distance by which any building, structure or facility must be separated
SETBACK:        from a property boundary, road easement, water body, or other identified legal,
                physical or biological condition.
                A water system that serves or is intended to serve two (2) living units or
SHARED WATER    commercial structures. The total number of people served may not exceed twenty four
SYSTEM:         (24). In estimating the population served, the reviewing authority shall multiply
                the number of living units times the county average of persons per living unit based
                on the most recent census data (17.36.101 ARM).

                structures, driveways, parking, RV or mobile home pads and spaces, landscaped areas,
                easements, utilities, surface water, drainage, etc.
SLOPE RATIO:    Relation of the horizontal projection of a surface to its rise. For example, a two-
                foot (2') horizontal run to a one-foot (1') vertical rise is shown as 2:1 or 2 to 1.
                Soil or mud that is carried out from the construction site by wind, drainage, truck
SOIL CARRYOUT:  traffic or other means onto other surfaces, such as paved road surfaces. Carryout
                has the potential to create unsafe conditions.
                A soil horizon is a layer generally parallel to the soil surface, where physical
SOIL HORIZON:   characteristics differ from the layers above and beneath. Horizons are defined in
                most cases by obvious physical features, chiefly color and texture.
SOIL TYPE:      Types of soil as identified by the Natural Resources and Conservation Service and
                their Web Soil Survey tool.

                the law, including streets, water supply, sewer, recreation, etc.
                Native wildlife species that are considered to be “at risk” due to declining
SPECIES OF      population trends, threats to their habitats, and/or restricted distribution. A list
CONCERN:        of such species, called the Montana Animal Species of Concern, is produced jointly
                by the Montana Natural Heritage Program and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. This
                list includes threatened and endangered species.
                A set of rules prescribing minimum requirements to prevent fire and explosion
STATE FIRE      hazards arising from storage, handling, or use of dangerous materials, or from other
CODE:           hazardous conditions. The State of Montana has responsibility for enforcing state
                fire codes for public buildings throughout the state (Title 50, Chapter 3 of Montana
                Code Annotated).
STORAGE AREAS:  Areas designated for storage, whether interior to a building/enclosed space or out
                in the open air.
STREET:         See "Road".
                One of the layers in road construction. Roads are built up in several layers
                consisting of sub-grade, sub-base, base and surface layer. The surface layer seals
                and prevents surface water from penetrating and weakening the base and sub-grade.
                The most common surface for rural roads is constructed from natural gravels.
                Bituminous and concrete surfaces provide more impermeable seals and are more
                resistant to the abrasive forces caused by the combined effects of weather and
                traffic. The road base (also referred to as the base course) is the main layer in
                terms of providing additional strength and load bearing capacity to the road. This
SUB-BASE:       layer often consists of crushed and graded materials or selected soils from natural
                sources which conform to certain characteristics known to improve the quality of the
                road. The sub-base is an additional strengthening layer with a similar purpose as
                the road base. As the road base takes care of the initial load dissipation, the sub-
                base will have less stringent quality requirements as compared to the road base. The
                sub-base may also act as a separating layer between the road base materials and the
                sub-grade. The natural soil on which the road is constructed is referred to as the
                sub-grade. The sub-grade consists of compacted or undisturbed soils or it may be a
                road fill with soils imported from elsewhere along the road line (source: Chapter 9,
                “Building Rural Roads” by the International Labor Organization).
SUB-GRADE:      One of the layers in road construction. See "Sub-Base".
