removed from office, and sets forth the policies and procedures to be followed
by the city council when undertaking such action against a member. (Ord. 2006-
04, 11-7-2006)
1-19-4-2: POLICY:
It shall be the policy of the city council that formal disciplinary action may
be taken against a member for any violation of this section
1-19-4. However, an elected member shall only be removed from office by a two-
thirds (2/3) majority vote of the remaining elected members for any violation
that the voting members find to be serious enough to warrant such action, or
for multiple violations of this section
1-19-4, regardless of the seriousness of each individual violation, the
cumulative effect of which is deemed by the voting members to be detrimental
enough to warrant removal from office. (Ord. 2006-04, 11-7-2006)
1-19-4-3: DEFINITION OF IMPROPER CONDUCT:
"Improper conduct" is any act or omission or series of acts or omissions, taken
in violation of federal, state, or local law, or which is found to be unfit,
dishonest, unjust or otherwise improper by a two thirds (2/3) majority vote of
the remaining elected members, excluding the member whose conduct is the
subject matter of the disciplinary action. (Ord. 2006-04, 11-7-2006)
1-19-4-4: EXAMPLES OF IMPROPER CONDUCT:
The following list is nonexclusive. A member may be disciplined or expelled
from office for any of the following acts:
   A.   Insubordination: Includes wilful or intentional disregard of the lawful
and reasonable instructions of the person charged with presiding over a meeting
or hearing.

   G.   Criminal Offense: Conviction of, or a plea of guilty or no contest to
any serious misdemeanor, or any felony offense.
   H.   Confidential Information: Members may, from time to time, become privy
to confidential information which shall remain confidential. No member shall
disclose or use, without appropriate authorization by a majority of the
members, any information acquired in the course of his or her official duties
which has been clearly designated as confidential. In general, confidentiality
is warranted whenever the presiding officer makes a determination that the
demands of individual privacy exceed the merits of public disclosure.
   I.   Other Inappropriate Behavior: Any other conduct found by a two-thirds
(2/3) majority vote of the members elected to be improper for a member of the
city council to engage in. (Ord. 2006-04, 11-7-2006)
1-19-4-5: SANCTIONS FOR IMPROPER CONDUCT:
In general, the sanction for improper conduct should correspond to the
seriousness of the offense. A member found by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote
of the elected members to have engaged in conduct which is improper under these
rules may be subject to any of the following sanctions:
   A.   Call A Member To Order: A member may be "called to order" by any other
member or the presiding officer, whenever he or she engages in a single act of
insubordination, minor disorderly conduct, or makes a negative personal remark
directed at another member, the mayor, a city employee, or member of the
general public, during a meeting of the council or any of its committees. A
member may be "called to order" by stating "point of order" or "the member is
out of order". The presiding officer shall determine if the subject conduct is
out of order.
   B.   Apology And Retraction: Whenever the city council finds it appropriate,
a matter may be resolved by requiring an offending member to make an oral or a
written apology to another member, the mayor, a city employee, or a member of
the general public, for improper conduct, or by requiring a retraction of any
offensive remarks.
   C.   Requirement To Leave The Meeting Room: Should a member become
aggressive or abusive or if a member refuses to accept a sanction imposed by
the council, said member shall be required to leave the meeting room for the
remainder of the meeting.
   D.   Censure: A formal resolution by the city council to reprimand one of
its own members for improper conduct. Such a resolution may be imposed by a
vote of a majority of the members elected, not including the member whose
conduct is subject to review.
   E.   Temporary Suspension: A member may be temporarily suspended (with or
without pay) for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days by a two-thirds (2/3)
majority vote of the remaining elected members after a finding that the member
has engaged in improper conduct.
   F.   Expulsion From Office: A member may be permanently expelled from office
by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the remaining elected members after a
finding that the member has engaged in improper conduct. A member shall only be
expelled from office for the most serious of violations of these rules. (Ord.
2006-04, 11-7-2006)
1-19-4-6: SANCTION PROCEDURES:
   A.   In matters where temporary suspension or permanent expulsion is not
warranted, an allegation of improper conduct against a member may be discussed
and voted upon immediately. Such discussion and vote may also be continued to
another time with the agreement of a majority of the members present. The
member against whom an allegation is made should have a fair and reasonable
opportunity to respond to the allegations and to argue the nature of his or her
conduct.
   B.   In matters serious enough that temporary suspension or permanent
expulsion may be an appropriate sanction, the city council shall follow the
following formal procedure to determine whether conduct is improper and, if so,
what sanction is appropriate.
   C.   Written allegations of improper conduct shall be delivered to the
member whose conduct is in question. Such written allegations shall
specifically identify the behavior complained of. Copies of any relevant
documentary evidence shall accompany the allegations.
   D.   The city council shall schedule a hearing or special meeting no less
than fifteen (15) days from the date on which notice is served upon the member
whose conduct is subject to review. The hearing or special meeting shall be
held no later than forty five (45) days from the date on which notice is served
upon the member whose conduct is subject to review. The public shall be given
notice of the hearing or special meeting, and the proceedings shall be open to
the public unless the presiding officer makes a determination that the demands
of individual privacy exceed the merits of public disclosure and closes the
meeting.
      1.   The following procedures shall apply to any hearing or special
meeting held for the purpose of disciplining a member:
         a.   The member accused may be represented by legal counsel at the
member's sole expense.
         b.   The member and a representative selected by the city council may
give an opening statement limited to fifteen (15) minutes each.
         c.   The city council shall present its case first, and the member
shall have the opportunity to cross examine witnesses. When the city council
has rested, the member shall present his or her case, and the city council
shall have the opportunity to cross examine witnesses. When the member has
rested, the city council shall have the option to present rebuttal.
         d.   At the close of all testimony each side shall have fifteen (15)
minutes each to present closing arguments. The city council shall go first,
followed by the member, followed by the city council's rebuttal, time for which
shall be reserved from the time allotted for closing.
         e.   Following closing arguments, the city council shall discuss the
merits of the case, and shall vote to determine whether the conduct complained
of constitutes improper conduct for which the member is subject to temporary
suspension or expulsion from office. A finding of "improper conduct" shall
require a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the members elected, excluding the
member whose conduct is subject to review.
         f.   If "improper conduct" is found, the city council shall discuss
the proper sanction. Temporary suspension or expulsion from office requires a
two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the members elected, excluding the member
whose conduct is subject to review. (Ord. 2006-04, 11-7-2006)

defended or indemnified by the City for any money judgments or litigation

Rule 1(a): Charge For Reconnection: Whenever the supply of water is turned off

Department.
Rule 3: Unless otherwise authorized by the Public Service Commission of the

of a dispute as to the accuracy of a meter, the consumer, upon depositing the
estimated cost of making a test, may demand that the meter be removed, and
tested as to accuracy, in his presence. In case the meter is found to be
registering correctly or in favor of the consumer, the cost of such a testing
and replacing of the meter shall be borne by the consumer.
In case the meter is found to be recording incorrectly and against the
consumer, in an amount in excess of two percent (2%), the amount deposited by
the consumer shall be refunded and a reasonable adjustment made for
overcharges, for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days previous to the demand
of the consumer for a test to be made.
A tolerance of one percent (1%) fast or slow is sufficient.
Rule 7: Dead Meters: If a meter is found not to register any period, the
utility shall compute the water used by taking the average of the water used
for the meter- reading period preceding and the meter-reading period following
the date when the meter was found to be dead, which amount shall be assumed to
be the amount of water used by the customer during the billing period in which
the meter was found dead. Exceptions will be made to this rule if the facts
clearly show that the above method does not give correct consumption for the
period.
Rule 8: If an error in the billing has been made, the utility may go back six
(6) months to recover any erroneous billing or must go back six (6) months in
correcting over-collected billing.
Rule 9: Water consumers are not permitted to interfere in any way with the
meter after it is set in place. In case the meter seal is broken or the working
parts of the meter have been tampered with or the meter damaged, the Water
Department may render a bill for the current month, based on an average of the
last two (2) months, together with the full cost of replacing the damaged part
or parts and may refuse to furnish water until the account is paid in full.
Rule 10: In no case shall the Water Department furnish water from one to two
(2) or more houses, whether the same are owned by one person or not.
Rule 11: All water services for commercial, industrial and general household
use shall be metered. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
Rule 12: Any authorized agent of the City Water Department shall have free
access at a reasonable hour to the premises of any water consumer to inspect,
examine, repair and facilitate repairs to any City fixture.
Rule 13: A suitable curb stop box approved by the Water Department must be
installed by the consumer on each service, at a point designated by the Water
Department, the cover to be level with the sidewalk or ground. All new or
replaced curb stop boxes shall be placed in the City’s easement or right-of-way
in a location designated by the Public Works Superintendent or his designee.
The owner shall be held responsible for the maintenance and care of the curb
stop box so that such curb stop box can be used at any time.
Refusal or neglect of the owner to provide said curb stop box and keep it in
good repair shall give the Water Department the right to cause same to be done
and the expense thereof charged to the water user.
The City shall give the account holder and property owner notice, in writing,
of the need for curb stop or curb stop box repair. If the account holder or
property owner does not provide proof to the City that the requested repairs
have been completed or scheduled for completion within thirty (30) days of the
notice, then the City, at the discretion of the Public Works Director and
Mayor, may replace or cause another to replace the curb stop, curb stop box, or
both at the expense of the account holder or property owner.
By resolution, the City may establish fees for a general curb stop and curb
stop replacement fund. If implemented, the City may charge a fee to each active
metered account, both commercial and residential, to be placed into a separate
account and used only for the replacement of curb stops and curbs stop boxes in
the City of Hardin. Upon determination of the Public Works Director and Mayor,
pursuant to this rule, a metered curb stop or metered curb stop box, two inches
(2") or less, may be replaced and the City may fund up to eighty-five percent
(85%) of the cost, but no more than one-thousand two-hundred dollars
($1,200.00), towards the cost of the replacement from this fund. Any remaining
amount shall be borne by the account holder or property owner. The City is not
obligated to use any of the curb stop replacement funds for replacement, and
the account holder or property owner may be responsible for the full cost of
any curb stop or curb stop box property owner or tenant is responsible for the
damage to curb stop or curb stop box whether by neglect or action.
The City will only replace or install one (1) curb stop or one (1) curb stop
box per account in a ten (10) year period. Any private water systems within the
City limits, such as those used by trailer courts or other similar multiple
domestic or commercial connections that have only one (1) meter and one (1)
account will be assessed only one (1) fee per account, regardless of the number
of housing connections upon that account. All connections in the interior of
such private systems that use additional curb stops or curb stop boxes shall be
the responsibility of the account holder or property owner and the City shall
not use any of the funds from this Rule to replace those connections.
Rule 14: A valve shall be placed at some accessible place inside the building
before and after the meter to shut the water off for draining the pipes in
order to prevent freezing or to repair City fixtures to all buildings
constructed after the date of this rule. In no case shall allowance for
vacancies be made unless the Water Department is notified and water is turned
off and on by the City Water Department personnel or some duly authorized
person.
Rule 15: All materials shall be of the type, style and kind approved by the
applicable rules and regulations of the State of Montana.
Rule 16: Contractors and builders are required to take out a permit for water
for building purposes. Owners shall see that same is paid before final
settlement, and the owner shall be responsible for the water rental.
Rule 17: No fireplug shall be opened or tapped except by the Fire Department of
the City, the Chairman of, or someone appointed by the Fire Department or the
Operations Director or duly authorized personnel of the Water Department.
Rule 18: All new customers and all customers that are being reconnected will be
required to pay a cash deposit for water service. The deposit will be returned
to the new customer if the customer is also the property owner and if the water
bill is continuously maintained in a current status for a twelve (12) month
period. One hundred fifty dollar ($150.00) deposit must be paid in full before
water and sewer services are provided.
Rule 19: If a water service is shut off for a delinquent water and/or sewer
bill and there is an inoperable curb stop on the service, the City will
immediately remove the inoperable curb stop, shut it off and make the repairs.
There will be no reconnection of the service until the repair bill, delinquent
and current water and sewer bills, and reconnection fee are paid in full. (Ord.

3-3A-20: RIGHT TO REGULATE:
The Water Department reserves the right to adopt from time to time any and all
rules and regulations concerning the consumption of water, the tapping of mains
and the installation of service. Any and all such rules and regulations when so
adopted by said Water Department shall be recommended by the Water and Sewer
Committee to the Council and approved by the Council and thereupon every such
regulation and rule shall be considered a part of an amendment to this article
and shall become a part of the contract of service with every consumer and
binding upon every consumer and binding upon every licensed plumber and
contractor. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-21: REFUSAL TO SERVICE APPLICANT:
Any utility may decline to serve an applicant until he has complied with the
rules and regulations governing water service as approved by the Water
Department. The utility may refuse to serve an applicant if, in its judgment,
the applicant's installation of piping equipment is regarded as hazardous or of
such character that satisfactory service cannot be given. In the event that the
utility shall refuse to serve an applicant under the provisions of this rule,
the utility shall inform the applicant that the question may be resubmitted
upon compliance with rules and regulations. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-22: CONSERVATION AND PREVENTION OF WASTE:
In the interest of preventing waste and promoting conservation of water, the
Operations Director may specify the hours and days during which such sprinkling
will be permitted and will publish notice thereof in newspapers at the start of
the sprinkling season, or whenever conditions require a change, and will
prominently post such notice in its local office; and make reasonable
determination based upon existing facts whether a customer is using water in a
wasteful manner. When the utility discovers any customer failing to observe the
hours or days for sprinkling service or wasting water, he shall deliver to such
customer a copy of the notice of hours and days of sprinkling and shall advise
the customer of the conservation fee which is to be charged if water is wasted
or the specified sprinkling hours or days are not observed by the customer. If
the customer is not at home at the time the utility discovers the customer's
waste of water or failure to observe the specified sprinkling times, then the
utility shall leave a notice of the violation at the customer's door and it
shall be deemed the customer has been adequately notified. If this customer is
found to be wasting water or failing to observe specified sprinkling times at
any subsequent time in the sprinkling season, the utility may charge and bill
the customer a "conservation fee" in the amount of ten dollars ($10.00) for
each subsequent violation. This charge is intended to represent the approximate
average cost which would be incurred had the utility actually disconnected and
reconnected the customer's water service. If the customer does not pay the
charges after a reasonable time, the utility may discontinue service and
subsequent reconnecting shall be paid by the customer. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-23: TAGGING AND SEALING METERS:
All meters will be sealed by the utility. The breaking of seals by unauthorized
persons or tampering with meters or meter piping is prohibited by law. (Ord.
00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-24: MULTIPLE SERVICE:
Where water is now supplied through one service to several houses, families or
persons, such as a trailer court or motel, and the owner or operator of the
property does not wish to go the expense of making the arrangement for separate
supplies as provided in the rules, the utility may continue to furnish water
under the condition that one person shall pay for all on the same service.
Certain multiple building complexes such as trailer courts, apartment
complexes, etc., under one ownership may be metered at one metering point at
the option of the utility. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-25: ADDITIONAL METERS:
In no case will the City furnish water from one meter to two (2) or more
houses, mobile homes or any combination thereof, whether the same are owned by
one person or not. Mobile home trailer parks, multi-unit dwellings, campuses,
public buildings complexes, and medical complexes may be excepted. (Ord. 00-02,
8-1-2000)
3-3A-26: TEMPORARY METERS FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES:
Water for construction purposes will be furnished through temporary meters and
paid for at the regular meter rates. In addition to the cost of the water, the
customer will be required to pay the actual cost of setting and removing the
temporary meter. In case it is not possible or practical to set a temporary
meter, the cost will be determined by applying the regular meter rates to a
quantity of water estimated by the City. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-27: SERVICE RESTRICTED:
Water mains including trunk water lines of the City shall not be tapped for the
purpose of making connection therewith for delivery of water from the City
water lines, including trunk lines, to any property or to any person or persons
located outside the City water service area 1 , and delivery of water to the
property of persons which is located outside of the City water service area
shall not be done by the City Water Department and no further permit shall be
granted to any person to tap any water main or water system of the City, for
the delivery of water to any premises or person outside of the City water
service area. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)

property owner’s plumber, or licensed contractor, for the property desiring
water service. The City Council shall, by resolution, adopt and amend from time
to time as is necessary a fee schedule for said water permits. All water taps
shall be made by a licensed contractor or licensed plumber. The licensed
contractor or licensed plumber tapping the water main shall use a saddle and
corporation stop approved by the Public Works Director. The plumber or
authorized contractor who is performing the excavation shall make the
excavation after securing any required excavating permits. After the tap has
been made in accordance with the Public Works Director, the service shall be
installed according to the standards of the Water Department. A curb stop shall
be required in all cases in the public right of way for each water service. The
City reserves the right to tap a water main at its discretion. The licensed
contractor or licensed plumber who performs the water tap is responsible for
any leaks or damage to the main caused by said water tap.
All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection to a water
main by a water tap shall be borne by the owner of the property connecting to
the main, and not by the City of Hardin. The owner shall indemnify the City
from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of water service to the property. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000; Ord.

No water service shall be turned on by anyone but an authorized representative
of the City Water Department until the title and interest in the water mains
and appurtenances have been transferred to the City and said water mains have
been accepted for service and maintenance by the City Council. Any water mains
that are presently within the public right of way as of the adoption of this
Article and which are now receiving service and maintenance by the City Water
Department shall be considered as accepted into the water distribution system
of the City and shall be subject to this Article. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-32: MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS:
The Operations Director shall determine the specifications for all materials
used to construct water mains, water services, and other appurtenances and

the Operations Director or the City Council shall be authorized to install
water mains, water systems and other appurtenances which connect to the water
distribution system. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-34: PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS INSIDE OF CITY LIMITS:
All water systems which are approved for construction and connection to the
water distribution system for the City and which lie inside private property
shall be considered as private water systems and therefore all maintenance of
the mains, valves, hydrants and other appurtenances shall be the responsibility
of the property owner.
Failure to maintain the system properly results in the Operations Director
being authorized to turn off service to said system until all maintenance has
been performed to the satisfaction of the Director. If a private water system
is shut off, all water meters shall be read and billed and no further service
or billing shall be made until water service is resumed. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)
3-3A-35: METERING OF PRIVATE SYSTEMS:
The City Council shall meter a private system as a whole. In addition to said
master metering, the City Council may provide individual meters to be used
within a private system if the following conditions are met by said private
system owner:
   A.   A master meter is provided, installed, and maintained by the City where
the City's water main meets the owner's service line to the private system.
   B.   The owner is legally responsible for all water that passes through the
master meter and agrees to pay for the same.
   C.   The owner shall protect the water master meter that is provided from
freezing, flooding, and other damage and shall be responsible for any repairs
to said master meter that may be required, excluding normal wear on the meter
from usage, in which case the City will make the necessary repairs for normal
wear from usage.
   D.   The City may provide the owner with a limited number of City approved
meters for use within the private system. Owner agrees to be responsible for
the installation and maintenance of said meters. Any and all risk of loss,
vandalism, or breakage of said meters is assumed by the owner. Said meters, if
to be placed in a trailer court developed after October 1986, shall be placed
at the owner's sole expense, in a frost- proof, underground enclosure that is
approved by the City's Operations Director.
   E.   The City is to read the individual meters on a monthly basis or when
service is discontinued. The owner agrees to have the individual meter's remote
readout placed on the front of all rental units.
   F.   The City shall bill each individually metered location as a residence
and in accordance with the then adopted water and sewer service rates. The City
shall total the amount of each individually metered location's usage and
subtract the same from the amount of water passing through the master meter.
The owner is responsible for paying, within fourteen (14) days of billing, for
the water and sewer charges applied to the difference, if any, between all of
the individual locations, water usage and master meter water reading.
   G.   A deposit in the amount required by the City Water Department's rules
and regulations for rental property will be required for each location. This
deposit must be made to the City before water and sewer service is provided.
The City will provide the owner with written evidence of said deposit payment.
The owner, only upon receipt of said written evidence, is allowed to permit
service to said location.
   H.   The owner shall deposit with the City a sum equal to fifteen dollars
($15.00) for each location within the private system. Said deposit must be
maintained at said level and owner agrees to pay within thirty (30) days of
notice of use of any or all of said deposit amount used by the City as
described herein. Failure to maintain the deposit in the required amount is a
breach of this agreement and may cause this agreement to be declared by the
City to be null and void.
      1.   The difference for water and sewer, if any, between the individual
location's water usage, and the amount passing through the master meter.
      2.   Any unpaid water and sewer bills of an individual location not
covered by the individual deposit.
      3.   Any meters that must be replaced because of loss, breakage,
vandalism, or tampering of any nature.
   I.   The owner shall provide a shutoff approved by the City's Water Director
for each metered location.
   J.   The owner must be current in all his obligations with the City before
individual metering can be allowed.
   K.   The owner will provide the City with a written easement that allows the
City to enter the private system property for any purpose incidental to the
metering described herein, including, but not limited to, reading meters and
removal of meters.
   L.   Owner shall use all due care to preserve the life of the meters
provided to the above-named private system, and shall promptly repair any and
all meters. Due care shall include effecting repairs within forty eight (48)
hours of notice of needed repairs.
   M.   If the owner violates any of these City rules and regulations, the
City, in addition to pursuing any remedy at law or equity shall have the right
to remove all of the individual meters provided for herein and return to the
master meter system only. The successful party in any action to enforce these
rules shall be awarded all reasonable costs, including attorney fees.
   N.   The City shall have a lien for the amount of any costs or fees incurred
pursuant to this agreement, on the private system's real property. (Ord. 00-02,

corners, the location and size of all water services, valves, water mains and
fire hydrants. Two (2) sets of paper prints will also be required in addition
to the reproducible set.
   C.   All excavation permits for said extension project must be released by
the City and all water permits will have to be paid for on both special
improvement projects as well as private contracts.
   D.   For private contracts, the engineer for the project must have submitted
written inspection reports to the City Engineer or Operations Director as well
as compaction test reports which substantiate that proper bedding, compaction,

City Water Department personnel must make a final inspection of the project
together. Any items which do not meet the specifications must be corrected to
conform to the approved plans and specifications.
   G.   Upon submittal of the above, the City will make a final review of the
completed work. If all work is found to be satisfactory by the City Engineer or
other authorized representative, a recommendation will be made to the City
Council at the earliest regular Council meeting to accept the completed
utilities into the water distribution system. If problems are found, they will
have to be corrected before any recommendation for acceptance will be
considered.
After acceptance of the utilities by the City Council, the City will service
and maintain the newly accepted water mains. (Ord. 00-02, 8-1-2000)

4-11-4:    REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA:
4-11-4-1: REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREAS:
   A.   The Regulated Flood Hazard Areas are the floodplains of the one hundred
(100)-year flood illustrated and referenced in the following specific studies
and reports described as follows:
      1.    The City of Hardin annexed jurisdictional areas on the following
September 2, 1981, FEMA Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) for Big Horn County:
         a.   Big Horn County FIRM Panel Number 300143 0001-1450.
         b.   Big Horn County FIRM Panel Number 300143 0225 B.
         c.   Big Horn County FIRM Panel Number 300143 0375 B.
   B.   The Regulated Flood Hazard Areas specifically described above have been
delineated, designated and established pursuant to 76-5-201 et. seq., MCA.
   C.   The Floodplain Administrator may obtain, review, and reasonably use any
Base Flood Elevation or Floodway data available from a Federal, state, or other
reliable source to administer and enforce these Regulations.
      1.   However, when special flood hazard area designations and water
surface elevations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator,
the more restrictive shall apply.
   D.   Sections 4-11-5, 4-11-6, 4-11-9, and 4-11-10 of these regulations
establish allowable uses and requirements for projects depending on the
specific location within the Regulated Flood Hazard Area. (e.g., Floodway,
Flood Fringe, etc.). (Ord. 2024-05, 2-20-2024)
4-11-4-2: INTERPRETATION OF REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA BOUNDARIES:
   A.   The mapped boundaries of the Floodplain illustrated in the referenced
studies and maps in this Section are a guide for determining whether property
is within the Regulated Flood Hazard Area. Base Flood Elevations and other
supporting documentation in the flood study, if such documentation exists, take
precedence over any map illustrations. Requirements for determining the exact
boundaries of the Regulated Flood Hazard Area and Floodway are provided below.
   B.   The Regulated Flood Hazard Area boundary is delineated by the Base
Flood Elevation. The physical regulatory boundary of the Regulated Flood Hazard
Area is the actual intersection of the applicable study Base Flood Elevation
with the existing adjacent terrain of the watercourse or drainway. See also ARM
36.15.501(6).
   C.   The Floodway boundary, where identified within the Regulatory Flood
Hazard Area, is as illustrated on the referenced maps and studies. The location
of the Floodway boundary may be physically located by referencing the study
data to a ground feature. The Floodplain Administrator's interpretation of the
boundary and decision may be appealed as set forth in Section 4-11-13.
   D.   The Floodplain Administrator may require an applicant to provide
additional information described below to determine whether or not the proposed
development, use, or artificial obstruction is within the Regulated Flood
Hazard Area:
      1.   Where Base Flood Elevations exist, the property owner and/or
applicant may provide additional information which may include elevation
information provided by an engineer or land surveyor in order to determine if
the proposed development, use, or artificial obstruction is subject to these
regulations. See also ARM 36.15.501(6).
      2.   Where Base Flood Elevations do not exist, the property owner and/or
applicant may provide additional information to be considered to determine the
location of the regulatory boundary or alternatively provide a computed Base
Flood Elevation provided by an engineer.
      3.   The Floodplain Administrator's interpretation of the boundaries and
decision may be appealed as set forth in Section
4-11-13.
      4.   Any owner or lessee of property who believes his property has been
inadvertently included in the Regulated Flood Hazard Area including the
Floodway or Flood Fringe may submit scientific and/or technical information to
FEMA in the form of an application for a Letter of Map Change. Scientific or
technical information submitted to FEMA for insurance purposes may be
considered by the Floodplain Administrator, although a determination by the
Floodplain Administrator whether a property is located within the Regulated
Flood Hazard Area and subject to these regulations is independent of any
determination made by FEMA.
(Ord. 2024-05, 2-20-2024)
4-11-4-3: ALTERATION OF REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA:
   A.   The Regulated Flood Hazard Area may be altered pursuant to Section 76-
5-201 et. seq. MCA and the requirements of these regulations. Alterations to
FEMA studies and maps can only be approved by FEMA through the Letter of Map
Change (LOMC) process.
   B.   Any change to the Regulated Flood Hazard Area shall only become
effective upon amendment to Section 4-11-4-1. A of these regulations.
   C.   Substantial physical change or new technical or scientific flood data
showing that the Base Flood Elevation has or may be changed or was erroneously
established shall be brought to the attention of DNRC and FEMA See also ARM
36.15.505(1)(a) and 44 CFR 65.3;
   D.   Any Floodplain permit application for a proposed development or
artificial obstruction that will result in an increase of half a foot (0.5') or
more to the Base Flood Elevation of a Regulated Flood Hazard Area without a
Floodway, or an increase of more than 0.00 feet to the Base Flood Elevation of
a Floodway, shall not be approved by the Floodplain Administrator until a
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is approved by FEMA.
      1.   Certification that no buildings are located in the areas which would
be impacted by the increased Base Flood Elevation (See also 44 CFR 65.12(a)
(5));
      2.   Evidence of notice to all property and landowners of the proposed
impacts to their properties explaining the proposed impact on their property
(See also 44 CFR 65.12(a)(3));
      3.   Information that demonstrates that alternatives are not feasible
(See also 44 CFR 65.12(2));
      4.   The Floodplain Administrator may represent the permit authority for
any necessary applications, approvals or endorsements such as the FEMA
Community Acknowledgement Form to FEMA where affecting the FEMA Special Flood
Hazard Area;
      5.   Any other supporting information and data as needed for approvals
(See also ARM 36.15.505, 44 CFR 60.3(c)(10), 44 CFR 60.3(d)(3), 44 CFR 65.7(3),
and 44 CFR 65.12).

Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) has been approved by FEMA.
   F.   For Regulated Flood Hazard Areas not designated by FEMA, alterations of
the Regulated Flood Hazard Area shall meet ARM 36.15.505.   
   G.   A determination by the Floodplain Administrator that land areas located
within the Regulated Flood Hazard Area are naturally above the Base Flood
Elevation as proven by a certified elevation survey does not constitute or
require an alteration of the Regulated Flood Hazard Area and may be maintained
as a public record that more explicitly defines the Regulated Flood Hazard Area
boundary. See also ARM 36.15.505(2).
   H.   The material submitted and response from FEMA may be considered by the
Floodplain Administrator for determining if a property or structure is within
the Regulated Flood Hazard area and subject to these regulations.
   I.   Elevating with suitable fill as permitted does not alter the Regulated
Flood Hazard Area or remove the elevated area from the Regulated Flood Hazard
Area.

4-12-5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS/STANDARDS:
The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and
construction of all wireless communications facilities governed by this
chapter.
   A.   Regulatory Compliance: All wireless communication facilities must meet
or exceed current standards and regulations of FAA, the FCC, and other local,
state or federal agencies with the authority to regulate facilities governed by
this chapter. The owner of the facility must demonstrate that the facility is
constructed, operated, and maintained in compliance with applicable standards.
This must be shown through a completed inspection process or certification by
an appropriate regulatory agency.
   B.   Setbacks: Antenna support structures must be set back from all property
lines, road rights of way and other easements, a distance equal to one hundred
twenty percent (120%) of the height of the structure. Accessory structures must
maintain a minimum of twenty feet (20') from all property lines. Alternative
setbacks may be approved only where it can be clearly demonstrated that the
proposed facility has no safety implications for adjacent properties and
easements.
   C.   Fencing: A chainlink or solid wood fence, or masonry wall at least six
feet (6') in height (8 feet if razor or barbed wire is to be used) shall be
constructed and maintained around the perimeter of the antenna support
structure site. Climb proof shields can be substituted for a fence or wall
around the structure. Solid fences, at least six feet (6') in height are
required adjacent to residential areas.
   D.   Lighting: Antenna support structures shall not be artificially lighted
unless required by the FAA or other local, state, or federal agency. If the FAA
requires safety lighting, the use of red beacons is preferred to flashing
strobe lights. Security lighting on site may be mounted up to twenty feet (20')
high on the tower, and shall be directed towards the ground to reduce light
pollution, prevent off site light spillage, and avoid illuminating the tower.
Cut off security lighting must be used adjacent to residential uses. When
incorporated into the approved design of the facility, light fixtures used to
illuminate sports fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be included in the
facility.
   E.   Signage: Signage shall be limited to nonilluminated warning and
equipment identification signs.
   F.   Colocation:
      1.   Antenna support structures should be designed in all respects to
accommodate both the applicant's antennas and antennas for at least two (2)
additional comparable antennas if the antenna support structure is over one
hundred feet (100') in height or for at least one additional comparable antenna
if the tower is between fifty (50) and one hundred feet (100') in height.
      2.   All new antennas must colocate on existing or approved antenna
support structures or alternative antenna support structures unless it can be
demonstrated colocation is not feasible as follows:
         a.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
         b.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
         c.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment, and
cannot be reinforced to provide sufficient strength.
         d.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing tower or structure, or the
antennas on the existing towers and structures would cause interference with

community. The Mayor shall grant an exemption for farmer’s markets, bake sales,
garage sales, lemonade stands, and may grant exemptions for other small and
irregular business activities if he determines they are similar to those
listed. The Mayor may, if needed, seek the guidance of the City Council for
determining if an application for exemption should be granted.

City ordinance, County ordinance, State law, or Federal law.

or inflicts bodily injury to a person or small animal; or

injury results in the death of the person.
These definitions do not apply to animals used in military or law enforcement
work while they are actually performing in that capacity.
      2.   Any owner and/or person who keeps, feeds, harbors or allows to stay
about the premises occupied or controlled by him/her within the City any
animals found to be a dangerous animal is guilty of maintaining a public
nuisance and is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six (6) months in
the County Jail, a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine, or both.
An animal is presumed to be a dangerous animal if it has demonstrated any of
the behaviors set forth in subsection C1 of this section. Such presumption is
rebuttable. Upon conviction of maintaining a public nuisance with a dangerous
animal, euthanasia of the animal may be ordered by the court. The court shall
order euthanasia of an animal involved in a fatal attack on a person.
Euthanasia may be ordered even if an owner is unable to be notified if due
diligence is used to locate an owner or keeper.
If the same animal is involved in a second offense, euthanasia of the animal is
mandatory.
If euthanasia is not ordered after first offense conviction, the court shall
order that an identifying microchip be implanted by a licensed veterinarian at
the owner's expense, identifying the animal as a dangerous animal. After
implantation of the identifying microchip, the animal must be kept in a fully
enclosed area unless on a leash with a muzzle. The owner or keeper of the
dangerous animal must keep Hardin City Animal Control notified of the animal's
address and any changes in address. The owner or keeper must also notify Hardin
City Animal Control of any change of ownership. Any new owner or keeper shall

Office, Hardin City animal control officer, or any other law enforcement agency
may impound and quarantine the dangerous animal involved pursuant to this
subsection C and in accordance with ARM 32.3.1204. The owner shall be liable
for any impoundment fees, regardless if the animal is released or euthanized.
      4.   This is an absolute liability offense, a mental state is not
necessary for conviction.
      5.   Upon petition of victim(s), prosecuting attorney or law enforcement,
the court shall consider euthanasia of dangerous animal for a first offense.
      6.   Law enforcement must notify local health officials of any biting
incident, in order that procedures of ARM 37.114.571 may be followed. (Ord.

exercise the option of serving the owner with a notice of violation in lieu of
impounding the animal.
   C.   In the event that the City of Hardin finds dogs or cats to be
suffering, it shall have the right forthwith to remove or cause to have removed
any such animals to a safe place for care at the owner's expense or to
euthanize them when necessary to prevent further suffering.

8-2-2: PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING EQUITABLE SERVICE CHARGES; RATES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this Chapter shall be to generate sufficient
revenue to pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete
wastewater system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the
wastewater system in proportion to each user's contribution to the total
loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength (BOD and SS), volume,
and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to insure a proportional distribution of
operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class).
   B.   Determining the Total Annual Costs of Operation and Maintenance: The
City, or its City Engineer, shall determine the total annual costs of operation
and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to maintain the
capacity and performance during the service life of the treatment works, for
which works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of operation
and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs,
equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling,
laboratory tests, and a reasonable contingency fund for emergencies and capital
improvements program.
   C.   Determining Each User's Wastewater Contribution Percentage: The City,
or its City Engineer, shall determine each user's average daily volume of
wastewater, which has been discharged to the wastewater system, which shall
then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the
wastewater system, to determine each user's volume contribution percentage. The
amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude
infiltration and inflow. The City, or its City Engineer, shall determine each
user's average daily poundage of five (5) day twenty degree (20o) Centigrade
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) which has been discharged to the wastewater
system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all five
(5) day BOD discharged to the wastewater system to determine each user's BOD
contribution percentage.
The City, or its City Engineer, shall determine each user's average suspended
solids (SS) poundage which has been discharged to the wastewater system which
shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all suspended solids
discharged to the wastewater system, to determine the user's suspended solids
contribution percentage. Each user's volume contribution percentage, BOD
contribution percentage and suspended solids contribution percentage shall be
multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs for wastewater
treatment of the total volume flow, of the total five (5) day twenty degree
(20o) Centigrade BOD and of the suspended solids respectively.
   D.   Determining a Surcharge System for Users With Excess BOD and SS: The
City, or its City Engineer, will determine the average suspended solids (SS)
and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average residential
user. The City, or its City Engineer, will assess a surcharge rate for all
nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and SS strengths greater than
the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge
sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users' above normal strength
wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be two hundred (200) p.p.m.
BOD and two hundred fifty (250) p.p.m. SS. The surcharge rate structure for
such above normal strength waste discharge is set forth in subsection I of this
Section. (Ord. 81-11, 12-2-81)
   E.   Determining Each User's Wastewater Service Charge: Each nonresidential
user's wastewater treatment cost contributions as determined in subsections B
and C of this Section shall be added together to determine such user's annual
wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class
of user and an equitable charge may be determined for each user based upon an
estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The
residential user rate for the calendar year shall be fixed at the average cost
to the user based on the average water usage during the months of January,
February and March. The monthly average residential usage during January,
February and March has been determined to be seven thousand two hundred thirty
two (7,232) gallons. The governing body may classify industrial, commercial and
other nonresidential establishments as a residential user, only upon the
nonresidential user requesting that his usage be reviewed and provided that the
wastes from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average
residential user with respect to volume, suspended solids and BOD. Each user's
wastewater treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the
rate schedule in subsection J of this Section. (Ord. 93-5, 8-3-93)
   F.   Payment of the User's Wastewater Service Charge and Penalties: The City
shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user's annual wastewater
service charge or one-twelfth (1/12) of the user's annual wastewater service
charge may be included with the monthly water and/or wastewater utility
billing. All accounts shall be due and payable fifteen (15) days after the
billing date. The City may discontinue service to any customer for violation of
rules or for non payment of bills after diligently attempting to induce the
customer to comply with its rules or to pay his bills. Service shall be
discontinued after seven (7) days' written notice that the utility bill is ten
(10) or more days delinquent.
The City shall not discontinue service to any consumer for violation of rules
or for nonpayment of bills, without first having tried diligently to induce the
consumer to comply with its rules or to pay outstanding bills. A record of
these efforts shall be maintained by the City.
The City shall not terminate service to any consumer unless written notice is
first sent by first class mail to the consumer that the bills are fifteen (15)
or more days delinquent, or that the violation of the rules must cease. If no
response to the first notice is received within ten (10) days of mailing, the
City shall send a second notice by certified mail, or personally serve the
customer, at least ten (10) days prior to the proposed termination. If no
response to the second notice is received within ten (10) days of mailing or
service, the City shall leave written notice in a place conspicuous to the
consumer, that service will be terminated on the next business day unless the
delinquent charges have been paid or the violation of the rules have ceased.
The City shall assess a reconnection charge of one dollar ($1.00) before
wastewater service is recontinued.
All disconnections shall be performed by the City between the hours of eight
o'clock (8:00) A.M. and noon and the City shall not discontinue service on a
Friday, Saturday, Sunday or a day prior to a holiday, except in the case of an
emergency.
   G.   Review of Each User's Wastewater Service Charge: The City shall review
the total annual costs of operation and maintenance as well as each user's
wastewater contribution percentage not less than every two (2) years and will
revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge system
established herein and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to
adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. If a
significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications
which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage, the user can
present at a regularly scheduled meeting of the government body, such factual
information and the City shall then determine if the user's wastewater
contribution percentage is to be changed. The City shall notify the user of its
findings, as soon as possible.
   H.   Notification: Each user will be notified, at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user
charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment services. (Ord. 81-11,
12-2-81)
   I.   Surcharge Rate Structure for Above Normal Strength Wastes: The City, or
its City Engineer, shall determine the average total suspended solids (SS) and
five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) loadings for the average
residential user or in lieu of such a determination will consider the average
residential strength wastes to be two hundred (200) mg/l BOD and two hundred
fifty (250) mg/l SS. The City Engineer shall assess a surcharge rate for all
nonresidential users. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the costs of
treating such users' above normal strength wastes. Such users shall pay an
additional service charge of one dollar thirty eight cents ($1.38) per one
thousand (1,000) gallons for each twenty five (25) mg/l over two hundred (200)
mg/l of BOD and sixty seven cents ($.67) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for
each twenty five (25) mg/l over two hundred fifty (250) mg/l SS.
   J.   Rate Schedule: Residential users are considered to be one class of user
and are assessed a charge of ten dollars twelve cents ($10.12) per month.
Nonresidential users with flow no greater than the average residential user's
flow of seven thousand two hundred thirty two (7,232) gallons per month and
with BOD and SS no greater than the average residential user's strength of two
hundred (200) mg/l SS shall pay the same charge of ten dollars twelve cents
($10.12) per month as the average residential user.
Nonresidential users with volumes greater than the average residential user
shall pay an additional charge of $0.4120 per one thousand (1,000) gallons per
month for all flows greater than the average residential user's flow of seven
thousand two hundred thirty two (7,232) gallons per month.
Any nonresidential user with BOD and SS greater than the average residential
user's strength of two hundred (200) mg/l and two hundred fifty (250) mg/l SS,
shall pay a surcharge in accordance with the rates shown in the surcharge rate
structure. (Ord. 88-3, 5-3-88)
   K.   Reduction in Charges, Supply Line Leak: If a user of the City's water
system and wastewater disposal system experiences a leak due to a supply line
break and excluding leaks from plumbing fixtures, and said supply line leak and
cause thereof are proved by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction
of the City Council, the City Council may, upon the user's written request,
deduct a portion of the wastewater system charge from the City bill that
includes sewer charges calculated on the amount of water leaked. The portion of
the wastewater system charge that may be deducted is to be based on the
difference between the user's water usage during that same period of the
previous calendar year. Each request for a reduction due to a supply line leak
shall be decided on a case by case basis. (Ord, 90-3, 3-6-90, eff. retroactive
to 11-15-89)
8-2-3: SURCHARGE; DUE AND PAYABLE:
The City Council hereby declares that the charges for sewage treatment and
wastewater service charge shall be on the water bills of all water customers

conformance with all the City standards and specifications and shall also be
approved by the City and the Montana State Department of Health and
Environmental Sciences before construction can commence.
The following items must be satisfactorily completed before the City will
recommend to the City Council acceptance of any sewer main extension project:
      1.   If the utilities are built by private contract, the person paying
for sewer line extensions shall execute a bill of sale to the City which
transfers to the City all rights, interests and title in the sewer mains,
manholes and appurtenances, free of any encumbrances.
      2.   A fully legible as-built reproducible mylar must be submitted to the
City Clerk of the plans for the sewer lines which show dimensions from property
corners, the location, grades, and size of all sewer services, mains and
manholes. Two (2) sets of paper prints will also be required in addition to the
reproducible set.
      3.   All excavation permits for said extension project must be released
by the City.
      4.   For private contracts, the engineer for the project must have
submitted written inspection reports to the City Engineer or Utilities
Superintendent as well as compaction test reports which substantiate that
proper bedding, compaction, etc., have been performed by the contractor. Tests
shall be performed by a licensed materials testing laboratory.
      5.   The engineer for private contracts shall submit a certification to
the City that the utility improvements meet or exceed the requirements of the
approved plans and specifications for the project and that the as-built plans
submitted accurately represent the location of said utilities as constructed.
      6.   The engineer for the project, the contractor, City Engineer and the
City Sewer Department personnel must make a final inspection of the project
together. Any items which do not meet the specifications must be corrected to
conform to the approved plans and specifications.
      7.   Upon submittal of the above, the City will make a final review of
the completed work. If all the work is found to be satisfactory by the City
Engineer or other authorized representative, a recommendation will be made to
the City Council at the earliest regular Council meeting to accept the
completed utilities into the sanitary sewer collection system. If problems are
found, they will have to be corrected before any recommendation for acceptance
will be considered.
      8.   After acceptance of the utilities by the City Council, the City will
service and maintain the newly accepted sewer mains. (Ord. 81-11, 12-2-81)
      9.   City sewer projects which are approved by the City Council may be
exempted from certain provisions of this Chapter as determined by the City
Council, but shall meet all the requirements of the State of Montana.
      10.   No sewer service shall be used by anyone until the title and
interest in the sewer mains, services, manholes and any other appurtenances
have been transferred to the City by a bill of sale and said sewer mains have
been accepted for service and maintenance by the City Council. Any sewer mains
that are presently within the public right of way, as of the adoption of this
Chapter and which are now receiving service and maintenance by the City Sewer
Department, shall be considered as accepted into the sanitary sewer collection
system of the City and shall be subject to the requirements of this Chapter.

shall direct the registered owner, last known registered owner, or known
violating person in possession of the vehicle, to submit payment of the civil

appeal the citation to the supervising officer or the officer than issued the
civil parking citation, or the Chief of Police if a supervising officer is not

supervising officer is not available, is final and there is no further appeal
process. An appeal must be made within ten (10) days of the citation, or the
offender waives the right to an appeal. The supervising officer or the Chief of
Police may extend the deadline for an appeal for good cause.

   A.   Authority: The zoning regulations, classifications, districts, and
provisions as herein set forth are in accordance with chapter 2, title 76 of
the Montana Code Annotated and Hardin's growth management plan.
   B.   General Purpose: They have been deemed necessary and developed with
consideration among other things to the character of each zoning district and
its peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of
buildings, to stabilize property values, to preserve recreation and
agricultural lands from conflict with urban development, to promote the
interest of health, safety, and general welfare, to secure safety from fire,
and to provide adequate open space for light and air, and to facilitate the
economic provision of adequate transportation, water, sewer, schools, parks,
and other public requirements.
   C.   Purposes Enumerated: The Hardin common council further declares this
zoning is adopted for the following specific purposes and policies:
      1.   To promote and guide development consistent with the goals and
objectives of the adopted growth management plan;
      2.   To prevent waste and inefficiency in land use;
      3.   To encourage innovations in residential development and renewal that
provides variety in type and design of dwellings and conservation of open
space; to preserve and enhance housing values and maintain residential
neighborhood aesthetics;
      4.   To encourage development near existing services, in or adjacent to
the city, and on less productive agricultural land and in consideration of the
existing floodplain in Hardin and those areas of wet soils or surface water;
      5.   To encourage cluster development, affordable housing, landscaping,
and energy conservation;
      6.   Prevent nonconforming mobile home parks from increasing the number
of dwelling units until the parks are brought up to compliance with this code;
      7.   To encourage multi-family and duplex housing as the market demands
and in conjunction with single-family housing in the southwest planning area as
defined in the GMP;
      8.   To provide adequate land and space for commercial and industrial
uses and to encourage such development in locations calculated to benefit the
community at large and in a manner consistent with the goals and objectives of
the city's growth management planning process;
      9.   To discourage strip commercial growth and residential development in
undesirable locations such as on prime farmland, potential prime farmland, and
farmland of statewide, local, and unique importance (as described by the USDA's
natural resources and conservation service) as well as in wildlife habitat
areas, and on floodplains and wetlands;
      10.   To limit commercial development along the major transportation
corridors to areas currently zoned C2 highway commercial and maintain the lots
in I-90 park subdivision as commercial sites;
      11.   Limit residential lots in the agricultural open space district to a
minimum of five (5) acres in size; and
      12.   Limit the extension of the industrial areas along the railroad
north into the existing residential districts.

11-1-2-4: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONS:
   A.   Intent: The intent of a planned unit development district (PUD) is to
provide flexible land use and design regulations through the use of performance
criteria so that developments that incorporate land uses which contain
individual building sites and/or common property may be planned and developed
as a unit.
   It is recognized that while the standard zoning function (use and bulk) and
the subdivision function (platting and design) are appropriate for the
regulation of land use in areas substantially developed, these controls
represent a type of regulatory rigidity and uniformity which may be inimical to
the techniques of land development contained in the planned unit development
district concept. Conventional area and density specifications are intended to
be replaced by application of the PUD district to lands upon which an approved
plan becomes the basis for control of land development.
   B.   Objectives: In order to carry out the aforementioned intent, a PUD
shall achieve the following objectives:
      1.   Contain adequate usable open space and recreational areas.
      2.   Preserve trees, outstanding topography, and geologic features, while
preventing soil erosion and uncontrolled surface water drainage.
      3.   Use land efficiently, resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets and thereby lower housing costs.
      4.   Have a development pattern in harmony with the goals and objectives
of the municipality.
      5.   Establish a variegated environment, occupancy tenure (e.g.,
individual ownership, cooperatives, condominiums, leaseholds), types of housing
(e.g., detached houses, townhouses, garden apartments), lot sizes, and
community facilities available to municipal residents.
      6.   Possess harmonious design and site planning of a quality that will
produce a more desirable environment.
   C.   Establishing Criteria For PUD Districts:
      1.   Plan: The term "plan" shall include all information required to
develop a PUD including, but not limited to, a narrative, sketches of the plat
or subdivision, all covenants relating to use, location and bulk of buildings
and other structures, intensity of use or density of development, private
streets, ways and parking facilities, common open space and public facilities.
      2.   Location: The planned unit development district may be applied in
any district if the objectives and provisions of this section are satisfied as
determined by the city-county planning board, and if the PUD is consistent with
the spirit and intent of the Hardin comprehensive plan.
      3.   Development Area: The minimum development area shall be at least
five (5) acres. The residential portion to be developed should be of the proper
size and shape to permit the clustering or grouping of a number of dwelling
units in order to enable a variety in occupancy tenure and dwelling types.
      4.   Ownership: The tract of land for a project may be owned, leased or
controlled either by a single person, corporation or by a group of individuals
or corporations. An application must be filed by the owner or jointly by owners
of all property included in the project. In the case of multiple ownership, the
approved plan and its amendments shall be binding on all owners or their
successors in title and interest.
      5.   Permitted Uses:
         a.   Residential Uses: Residences may be of any variety of types.
         b.   Accessory Commercial, Service and Other Nonresidential Uses:
Commercial, service and other nonresidential uses may be permitted (or
required) by action of the Planning Board where such uses are scaled primarily
to serve the residents of the PUD or the area immediately surrounding the PUD
if such uses are consistent with the Hardin Comprehensive Plan.
      6.   Intensity of Land Use: Because land is used more efficiently in a
PUD, improved environmental quality can often be produced with a greater number
of dwelling units per gross building acre than usually permitted in
traditionally zoned districts. The Planning Board shall determine in each case
the appropriate land use intensity or dwelling unit density for individual
projects. The following chart shall be used as a guide when evaluating proposed
PUD density ranges:
 
                                                            Percentage of Open
Type of Residential Minimum Density Per Maximum Density Per Space, Including
Development         Acre                Acre                all Areas Not
                                                            Covered by
                                                            Structures
Single-family       3 units             5 units             80%
detached
Townhouse           6 units             12 units            70%
Mid-rise apartment
structures (3 to 6  16 units            28 units            70%
stories in height)
High-rise above 6   32 units            60 units            50%
stories
 
Where a PUD is an inter-mix of all types of units, the open space should be
fifty percent (50%) minimum.
      7.   Recreation, Open Space and Landscaping: The recreational facilities,
open space network and landscaping should be designed to enhance community
character.
         a.   Recreation facilities and open space plans should be accompanied
by a narrative explanation of how common recreation facilities and open spaces
are to be owned, maintained and used.
         b.   The landscaping plan should be sufficiently developed to indicate
existing and proposed topography and the location of existing and proposed
trees, shrubs and other planned materials.
         c.   Adequate landscaping should be provided to reduce the visual
impact of off-street parking areas and provide a logical transition between the
Planned Unit Development District and surrounding uses.
         d.   Special consideration should be given to pedestrian movement from
the standpoint of safety, convenience and amenity. Sidewalks, curbs and gutters
should be considered in the design of the overall circulation system.
Walkthroughs to adjoining areas should also be considered.
         e.   The energy efficiency of the project should also be considered,
with regard to site and building orientation to local climatic conditions, and
to fuel consumption, both domestic and transportation.
   D.   Procedure:
      1.   Application for PUD: The procedure for obtaining a change of zoning
district to PUD shall be consistent with Section
11-1-9-2 of this Chapter. In addition, ten (10) copies of the following shall
be submitted:
         a.   The PUD plan showing the densities proposed for each planned land
use.
         b.   An environmental impact assessment as defined in the Hardin
subdivision regulations. 1
         c.   A preliminary plat as defined in the Hardin subdivision
regulations.
         d.   A traffic accessibility study if determined necessary by the
Planning Board.
      2.   Planning Board Findings: The Planning Board shall, in its review of
the application, make the following findings concerning the proposed
development:
         a.   The uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and
potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not
be achieved under any other district.
         b.   Land surrounding the proposed development can be planned in
coordination with the proposed development and shall be compatible in use.
         c.   The proposed change to a planned unit development district is in
conformance with the general intent of the comprehensive master plan.
         d.   Existing and proposed streets are suitable and adequate to carry
anticipated traffic within the proposed district and in the vicinity of the
proposed district.
         e.   Existing and proposed utility services including, but not limited
to, water sanitary sewer and storm sewer are adequate for the proposed
development.
         f.   Each phase of the proposed development as it is proposed to be
completed must contain the required parking spaces, landscape and utility areas
necessary for creating and sustaining a desirable and stable environment.
         g.   The proposed development will create no significant adverse
environmental impact upon an area or affected natural elements making up the
physical and natural environment of the area.
      3.   Planning Board Action And Report: The planning board may approve,
approve with conditions, or disapprove the development as proposed. The
planning board shall submit a report to the appropriate governing body
incorporating its findings and recommendations concerning the application for
zone change. The approval of the planning board cannot be construed as an
official approval of any preliminary plat.
   E.   Zone Change And Subdivision Phases:
      1.   The appropriate governing body shall proceed with consideration of
the application for zone change upon receipt of the planning board report
concerning the proposal.
      2.   Upon approval of the zone change, the applicant shall have a maximum
time period of twelve (12) months within which to submit applications for
preliminary subdivision approval of all or part of the proposed development. If
no application is submitted within the twelve (12) month period, the
appropriate governing body may, on its own motion, consider rezoning the
subject property to its former status.
      3.   Upon approval of a preliminary subdivision for the proposed
development by the planning board, the applicant shall have a maximum time
period of one year within which to file final subdivision plans with the county
clerk and recorder. Noncompliance with this time restriction shall cause the
appropriate governing body to consider reverting the zoning classification of
the subject property to its former status. (Proposal dated 6-19-1979)

BASEMENT, CELLAR: A "basement" has less than one-half (1/2) of its height below
grade; a "cellar" has more than one-half (1/2) of its height below grade. If a
basement is subdivided and used for dwelling purposes, it is to be counted as a
story; a cellar is not.
GRADE: The average level of the finished surface of the ground for buildings
more than five feet (5') from a street line. For buildings closer than five
feet (5') to a street, the grade is the sidewalk elevation at the center of the
building. If there is more than one street, an average sidewalk elevation is to
be used. If there is no sidewalk, the city engineer or the county surveyor or
someone officially acting as such shall establish the sidewalk grade.
HEIGHT OF A BUILDING: The vertical distance from the grade to, a) the highest
point of a flat roof, b) the deck line of a mansard roof, or c) the average
height between eaves and ridge for gable, hip, and gambrel roofs.
STORY: The part of a building from one floor to the next floor above or to a
ceiling above if there is no floor above. A "half story" is space under a
sloping roof, all of which space must be at least three feet (3') high but not
more than sixty percent (60%) of which floor area may be finished off for use.

set back an additional foot over the yard requirements, it may be increased in
height two feet (2') over the height limit up to a limit of sixty feet (60').
      2.   Chimneys, church steeples, cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, fire
towers, monuments, stacks, stage towers or scenery lofts, tanks, water towers,
ornamental towers, spires, radio and television towers, grain elevators, or
necessary mechanical appurtenances are exempt from height regulations.
      3.   Buildings in the C1 district may be increased in height one foot
(1') from each foot that the building is set back from all required yard lines.
   B.   Building heights shall be lowered in the following instances:
      1.   No building or structure or any portion thereof shall be erected
within the approach-take off zone of any runway or landing strip in excess of a
height above the elevation at the end of the runway equal to one-fortieth (1/
40) of the horizontal distance from the end of the runway, measured along the
centerline of said runway extended. The approach zone is considered to be a
trapezoidal area extending from the end of, and in the same direction as, said
runway for a distance of two (2) miles. Such area is five hundred feet (500')
wide at the end of the runway and two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') wide
two (2) miles from the end of the runway. Further, no building or structure or
any portion thereof shall be erected in the transition zones on either side of
an approach-take off zone of any such landing strip in excess of a height above
the elevation at the end of said runway computed as follows: one-fortieth (1/
40) of a horizontal distance from the end of said runway measured along the
centerline of said runway extended, plus one-seventh (1/7) of the horizontal
distance to the near edge of the approach zone, measured perpendicular to the
centerline of said runway extended. Where an airport is bounded by a public
road, the effective length of runways directed over any such public road shall
be computed (using a slope of 40 feet horizontal to one foot vertical) to
produce a height of fourteen feet (14') at the right of way line of such road
nearest to the airport. (Ord., 9-3-1974)
11-1-5-4: REPAIRING AND REMODELING:

one ownership on the effective date of this chapter.
SIDE YARD: The area from the front yard line to the rear yard line and from the
main building drip line to the side lot line.

11-1-11-4: ZONING COMPLIANCE PERMIT:
Big Horn County commissioners allow Hardin to control land uses out one mile
from its municipal boundaries through the extraterritorial zoning powers of
state statute. New land uses, such as new homes, mobile homes, businesses, and
the introduction of large animals, proposed in this one mile zoning area must
obtain a zoning compliance permit from the city. This allows the city and
landowners to ensure that new uses are in compliance with the established
growth management plan adopted by the people of the community before
substantial investment has been made in a new land use activity that may not be
allowed.
Failure to obtain the compliance permit places the new use in violation of
Hardin's zoning ordinance and may subject the landowner to the penalties for
such violation as contained in section
11-1-12 of this chapter.
Application for a zoning compliance permit is made to the city clerk on the
form therefor in her office. Such application can be made at any time. If the
application is complete, the city has one week in which to approve,
conditionally approve, or deny the application. The application is reviewed by
the superintendent of public works and the city planner for compliance, after
which each (or another city designated representative) signs the application.
If the land use for which the application is submitted is not deemed in
compliance, the landowner may submit an application to the zoning commission
(with final decision by the common council) through the zone change, zone
variance, or conditional use process as provided herein.
There is no zoning compliance permit application fee, as this is process
designed to save landowners money and time and the city future problems.
An application for a zoning compliance permit shall, at a minimum, include the
following:
   A.   Application form for zoning compliance permit.
   B.   Legal description and general location.
   C.   Site plan showing planned land use and existing land uses if any plus
the following information:
      1.   Setbacks from public rights of way;
      2.   Dimensions of land use;
      3.   Number of dwelling or animal units;
      4.   Provisions for water, sewer, and storm drainage;
      5.   Adjacent land uses; and
      6.   Additional information, if any, as required by the city to
understand what is proposed.
   D.   Address of owner of record and purchaser, if applicable.
   E.   Commercial, industrial, and multi-family land uses proposed shall
provide specific site plans showing details of the proposed development to
include lot coverage, floor area ratios, landscaping, numbers of units, access
and egress, solid waste disposal locations, signage, lighting, and size and
access points for public utilities.
   F.   Information required here may be prepared without professional drawings
or studies. (Ord. 2003-03, 4-15-2003)
