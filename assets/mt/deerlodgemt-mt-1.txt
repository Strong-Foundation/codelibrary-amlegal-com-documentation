concentration as may exceed limits established by the Public Works Director or
MTDEQ in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
      (8)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both, which constitute a
“slug.” A slug is any discharge of water or wastewater which in concentration
of any given constituent or in quantity of flow exceeds for any period of
duration longer than 15 minutes more than five times the average 24-hour
concentration or flows during normal operation and shall adversely affect the
collection system and/or performance of the wastewater treatment works;
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the discharge permit limits as dictated by MTDEQ; or
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, from suspended
solids which, interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.

§ 4.10.070 LIABILITY FOR CHARGES; DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The property owner to which municipal sewerage service is rendered
shall be liable for all charges for such service.
      (1)   A premise is deemed to have sewer service if it has an existing
sewer service line connected to the city sewer main.
      (2)   The basic infrastructure fee for sewer service will continue to be
charged monthly regardless of service status.
   (B)   Sewerage service discontinuance may only occur if the premises are
only served by city water and no other water sources are not continuously used
for human occupancy.
      (1)   The city may disconnect the water service for non-payment of the
sewer charges.
      (2)   The city will first make two attempts to contact the property owner
(via phone, email or door hanger).
   (C)   If the city discovers that sewerage service that was previously
discontinued (through a water shut off) is reactivated without proper
authorization, the owner of the premises receiving the unauthorized sewerage
service is liable for all sewerage service charges starting when the sewerage
service was last discontinued and continuing forward. In cases when property
owner knew and was willfully and blatantly unauthorized to turn on the water
service to owner’s premises, the Public Works Director may deny future
applications from that property owner for discontinuance of sewer service for
any premises owned by that owner.
   (D)   (1)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect that:
         (a)   All bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth on
the bill;
         (b)   If any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second bill
will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid within
ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued for

utility billing. This official shall be authorized to order that the customer’s
service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final
determination of the customer’s complaint.

charge in the sum of $20.
   (E)   (1)   All charges for such service shall be made a part of the
statements, if any, for water service to the same premises, and no payment of
water or sewerage charges so billed shall be accepted without payment of both
said items.

regulations established for the sewerage system within ten days after notice of
violation thereof, the water service to the premises involved shall be
discontinued and shall not be resumed until all of the past due bills for water
and sewer service have been paid in full and the property owner comes into
compliance with all such rules and regulations.

by the Public Works Department. Until the city shall have such notice and a
reasonable opportunity to inspect the discontinuance, the customer shall be
held responsible for all service rendered.
      (2)   Should the customer desire to discontinue the use of water

less than a 24-hour period, the city will perform that service during regular
working hours without charge.
         (b)   Shut offs occurring during the weekends, holidays or non-working
hours shall be performed only at the expense of the customer, unless such shut
off is the result of an emergency not created by the neglect of the customer.
      (4)   The owner of property to which water service is supplied is
responsible upon discontinuance or abandonment of the water service to shut off
said service at the curb box, disconnect the service line at the point of
connection with a city water main, or, when shut off at curb box or
disconnection from a water main is not practical, disconnect the service line,
for the discontinued water service from the host service line.
         (a)   All disconnections are by a method and means acceptable to the
Public Works Director to prevent unauthorized resumption of water service and
protection of the integrity of the city water system. Should the owner fail to
satisfactorily disconnect such service, the Public Works Department may make
such disconnection and charge the owner the actual cost thereof.
         (b)   Reconnection of water service at the water main is subject to
the same connection fees and requirements applicable to a new connection.
         (c)   The water basic infrastructure fee will be continued to be
charged monthly, even if the water is disconnected as the potential for
reconnection is present.
      (5)   If the city discovers that water service that was previously
discontinued is reactivated without proper authorization, the owner of the
premises receiving the unauthorized water service is liable for all water
service charges starting when the water service was last discontinued and
continuing forward.
   (B)   City discontinuance; notice of discontinuance.
      (1)   The city shall not discontinue service to any customer for
violation of rules and regulations or for non-payment of bills without first
having tried diligently to induce the customer to comply with its rules and
regulations, or to pay his, her or their bills.
         (a)   A record of such effort must be maintained. These efforts may
include phone calls, emails, written notice and door hangers.
         (b)   Documentation of two attempts of communication shall be
considered diligence on the city’s part.
      (2)   Service shall actually be discontinued only after at least seven
days’ written notice shall have been given to the customer by the city that
bills are ten or more days delinquent, or that the violation of rules must
cease, however, where fraudulent use of water is detected, or where the city’s
regulating or measuring equipment has been tampered with, or where a dangerous
condition is found to exist on the customer’s premises, the water may be shut
off without advance notice.

shall only be done by the city and any authorized person or consumer personally
reconnecting a residential, commercial, or industrial service or causing such

year-round basis.
         (b)   The water basic infrastructure fee will be assessed year-round.
   (N)   In the interest of preventing waste and promoting conservation of
water, the city may specify the hours and days during which lawn and landscape

enlarged, extended, constructed or structurally altered, unless the use is
changed to a permitted use;
      (2)   Any non-conforming use may be extended to any other part of a
building designed for such use, but no such use may be extended in any way to
occupy land outside the building;
      (3)   Any structure, or structure and land, in or on which a non-
conforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and the non-conforming use
may not thereafter be resumed; or
      (4)   Whenever a non-conforming use of structure or a premise ceases for
90 days, the structure or premises shall not thereafter be used, except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located, the
term CEASES, as used in this subchapter, shall mean that the activity in
question has not been in operation for a period of 90 days.
   (B)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the lack of required off-street
parking as applied to B-1 Central Business District shall not render structures
as non-conforming.

CLARK FORK RIVER SUPERFUND OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 11.01.250.010 INTENT.
   (A)   (1)   The intent of the Clark Fork River Superfund Overlay District is
to protect public health and safety while allowing appropriate development
activities in the city portion of the Clark Fork Superfund site. The
requirements of this Overlay District also serve as institutional controls in
the context of the Federal Superfund law (Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), being 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 et seq.,
commonly known as Superfund).
      (2)   Notwithstanding the location of the Overlay District or operable
unit of the Superfund site, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as
limiting the ability of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or Montana
Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to act on the Comprehensive
Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act (CECRA) or any other environmental
authority, or to restrict restoration actions by the Montana Department of
Justice natural resource damage program or any other federal or state natural
resources trustee. DEQ may require soil testing or other information to be
provided for projects outside the Overlay District when circumstances warrant,
such as when materials are suspected to be imported or contaminated.
Furthermore, DEQ may require other contaminants besides arsenic to be tested
for and addressed.
   (B)   The application of the Clark Fork River Superfund Overlay District is
intended to ensure future developmental activities in the Overlay District do
not damage or alter remedial actions (soil caps) or cause arsenic contaminants
to migrate from current depositions into the river or other places in the
environment.
(Prior Code, § 11.01.250.010) (Ord. 171, passed 9-17-2018; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.01.250.020 DESIGNATION AND LOCATION OF THE CLARK FORK RIVER SUPERFUND
OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   This Overlay District covers the area contaminated by mining and
smelting wastes from operations further upstream in the Butte and Anaconda
areas and encompasses the area of the city that is included within the
boundaries of the Clark Fork River operable unit of the Milltown Reservoir/
Clark Fork River Superfund site described in the record of decision for the
Superfund site. The map attached as Exhibit A generally illustrates the
boundaries of the Overlay District, but the City Planner interprets the actual
boundaries of the Overlay District associated with the Clark Fork River
Superfund site operable unit through coordination with the Montana Department
of Environmental Quality (DEQ). DEQ determines the actual boundaries of the
Overlay District based on the operable unit’s boundaries per the record of
decision for the Superfund site. Therefore, for any ground disturbance or other
construction activities within or in the immediate vicinity of the Overlay
Districts as shown on the map attached as Exhibit A, the applicant will first
consult with the City Planner to determine whether the activities require
further information or review for compliance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Overlay District shown on the map attached as Exhibit A is limited
to the area within the city limits, but the actual Clark Fork River operable
unit of the Superfund site extends outside the city limits and the associated
jurisdiction of the city. Annexations of future lands in the operable unit will
require that the Overlay District boundaries be determined (per the record of
decision) and shown on zoning map amendments.

earthen material or import of more than one cubic yard of fill within the
Overlay District first requires the formal notification to the City Planner

replacement, the City Planner determines that an emergency condition exists
warranting immediate action;
         (b)   The actions and emergency waiver are in compliance with and
properly address other applicable laws and regulations, including but not
limited to, the city floodplain regulations; and
         (c)   The City Planner agrees upon the nature and type of the proposed
emergency repair and/or replacement.
      (2)   (a)   Authorization (waivers) to undertake emergency repair and
replacement work may be given verbally by the City Planner if he or she states
that written authorization would unduly delay the emergency works.
         (b)   Such verbal authorization must be followed by a written
authorization describing the emergency condition and the type of emergency work
agreed upon and stating that a verbal authorization had been previously given.
      (3)   Upon authorizing any waiver, the City Planner will immediately
notify DEQ of the waiver by quickest possible means.
         (a)   Montana DEQ may then commence soil testing and remediation
efforts if required.
         (b)   After DEQ actions, the City Planner and DEQ will consult to
determine whether conditional use permit review will be required.

   The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
   (A)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination made be an administrative
official in the enforcement of the zoning ordinances;

ordinances upon which such Board is required to pass under such zoning
ordinances; and

§ 11.01.280.070 PROCESSING AN APPEAL FOR A ZONING VARIANCE.
   Before any variance can be granted, the Board shall make findings of fact
based upon evidence produced at a public hearing setting forth and showing that
the following circumstances exist:
   (A)   In considering all proposed variances to the ordinance, the Board
shall, before making any findings in a specified case, first determine that the
proposed variance will not amount to a change in the use of the property to a
use which is not permitted within the district;
   (B)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land such as size, shape, topography or location, not applicable to other
lands in the same district and that literal interpretation of the provision of
this title would deprive the property owner of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties similarly situated in the same district under the terms of this
title;
   (C)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
   (D)   That granting the variance requested will not confer a special
privilege to the subject property that is denied other lands in the same
district;
   (E)   That granting the variance will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and
zone in which subject property is situated;
   (F)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the reasons
set forth in the application of appeal justify the granting of the variance and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land;
   (G)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting
of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental
to the public welfare; and
   (H)   The fact that property may be utilized more profitably will not be the
sole element of consideration before the Board of Adjustment.

park area as surveyed for the plat (see requirements of preliminary plat
above). These areas shall remain in private ownership and shall not be
dedicated to the public, unless expressly accepted by the City Council. It
shall be the responsibility of the RV park owner to maintain the park and
recreation area. The City Council may accept cash-in-lieu of requiring the park
area.
         (d)   Adjacent land buffer. RV parks located adjacent to industrial,
commercial or residential land uses shall provide screening, such as fences or
natural growth along the property boundary line separating the park from these
adjacent uses.
         (e)   Storage. The City Council may require that a common area be
provided, which shall not be calculated as part of the parkland dedication, for
storage or parking for boats, trailers or other recreational vehicles. If such
a common area is included, it shall be restricted for storage only and no
structure, vehicle, boat or other container may be used for living in.

   (B)   The main steps in the preliminary plat review process are as follows;
the following subchapters describe each of the steps in more detail:
      (1)   Pre-application;
      (2)   Application submittal;
      (3)   Element review;
      (4)   Sufficiency review;
      (5)   Soliciting agency comments;
      (6)   Staff report;
      (7)   Public review; and
      (8)   Planning Board hearing and recommendation (major subdivisions only)
Step 8: City Council hearing and decision.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.030.010) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.030.020 PRE-APPLICATION.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   A pre-application meeting to explain the subdivision application
and review process is required. The pre-application meeting is intended to
provide an overview of what will be required for the subdivision application,
as well as alerting the subdivider to potential issues and/or provide
information that could affect design.
      (2)   A pre-application meeting is scheduled with the Administrator by
the subdivider filling out and submitting a pre-application request form in
addition to the required pre-application materials.
   (B)   Pre-application submittal.
      (1)   The subdivider shall submit a completed pre-application form (refer
to
§ 11.02.100.010, Appendix B).
      (2)   When a complete pre-application form has been submitted to the
Administrator, the Administrator shall notify the subdivider of the date and
time of the meeting. The meeting shall be held within 30 days of the subdivider
submitting the required materials.
      (3)   The Administrator may notify and invite to the pre-application
meeting representatives of affected public utilities and review agencies at the
local, state and federal levels, including, but not limited to, the local
sanitarian and/or DEQ reviewer, County Clerk and Recorder, Public Works
Department, Fire Department, law enforcement, emergency services, and the like.
The role of these agencies is to provide comment relevant to their agency’s
review. The contacted agencies may also submit written comments prior to the
pre-application meeting.
   (C)   Pre-application meeting. The subdivider or their officially designated
representative is required to be present at the pre-application meeting. At the
pre-application meeting, the Administrator shall:
      (1)   Identify the state laws, local regulations and growth policy
provisions that may apply to the subdivision review process;
      (2)   Provide the subdivider with a comprehensive list of the
information, documents, fees and other materials that shall be required in
order to submit a preliminary plat application;
      (3)   Provide to the subdivider a list of agencies that will be contacted
during the review process and the timeframes that the public utilities,
agencies and other entities are given to respond; and
      (4)   Identify particular additional information the Administrator
anticipates will be required for review of the subdivision application.
However, the identification of this information by the Administrator at the
pre-application stage does not in any way limit her or his ability to require
additional or different information at a later time.
   (D)   Pre-application duration. Within six months of the pre-application
meeting, the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat application or a pre-
application extension request. If a preliminary plat application or extension
request is not received within six months, the pre-application is void and will
need to be re-submitted if the subdivider wishes to proceed. Requests for
extensions shall be addressed to the Administrator, who may approve an
extension for up to six months. The Administrator shall notify the subdivider
in writing of a decision to approve or deny an extension. If denied, the
reasons for denial shall be included in the notice.
   (E)   Restrictions on improvements.
      (1)   General. By requesting the pre-application meeting, the subdivider
agrees to the following provisions restricting construction and changes to the
property. These provisions are intended to allow for a complete evaluation of
the proposed subdivision compared to the pre-subdivision condition.
      (2)   Construction timing.
         (a)   Once a request for a pre-application meeting has been submitted,
the subdivider shall not engage in construction of subdivision-related
improvements prior to approval of the preliminary plat application.
Subdivision-related improvements include water, wastewater, stormwater and
solid waste facilities; subdivision- related utilities; and roads, streets and
any improvement requiring grading or earth moving. All historic, cultural,
archaeological and natural resources on the site shall remain unaltered.
Riparian vegetation and wetlands may not be damaged or removed.
         (b)   The following activities shall be allowed:
            1.   Work related to testing, analytical or monitoring activities
that may be required by these regulations or are relevant to the development of
the preliminary plat application; and
            2.   Activities approved in advance and in writing by the
Administrator that qualify as actions that are not subdivision-related.
         (c)   The city shall not be responsible if improvements or alterations
have to be eradicated, moved, repaired or rebuilt due to a subdivider making
property improvements prior to and/or not in accordance with conditions of
preliminary approval.
      (3)   Enforcement.
         (a)   A violation of the restrictions in this subchapter subjects the
subdivider to the enforcement provisions and penalties in
§ 11.02.010.080.
         (b)   Restoration of any resource alteration, as described above, may
be required as a condition of subdivision approval.

      (34)   Mail delivery.
   (C)   Preparing the application. It is the subdivider’s responsibility to
provide sufficient information in the application to show that significant
impacts can been mitigated.
      (1)   Coordination with agencies and interested parties. Prior to
submitting an application, the subdivider is advised to coordinate with
agencies and consider their comments in the design of the subdivision. The
Administrator will have identified an initial list of relevant agencies at the
pre-application meeting. Correspondence with agencies should be submitted with
the application. Contacting agencies does not preclude the Administrator from
contacting the same agencies during preliminary plat application review.
      (2)   Consideration for installing improvements. As part of the
subdivision approval process, the subdivider may be required to install capital
improvements, such as, but not limited to, roads, sidewalks, streetlights,
water, and sewer, or secure a financial guarantee for their installation. While
preparing the application, the subdivider should be aware of these costs and
plan for the expenditures prior to final plat approval.
   (D)   Submitting the application.
      (1)   Generally. The subdivider shall submit a complete application to
the Administrator consisting of one paper copy and one electronic copy in
either a Microsoft Word or PDF file.
         (a)   When a subdivision lies partly within an incorporated
municipality and partly in the county. If the proposed subdivision lies partly
within the city and partly within the unincorporated area of the county, and a
portion of the subdivision is proposed to remain in the county, the application
and preliminary plat must be submitted to the City Administrator and to the
County Administrator. Both the city and county governing bodies issue decisions
on the application.
         (b)   When a subdivision is in an unincorporated area and proposed to
be annexed (also see
§ 11.02.030.050). If the subdivider proposes to annex a subdivision located in
the unincorporated county into the city, the subdivider shall submit the
proposal to the Administrator of the municipality and the municipality shall
proceed with review for annexation and subdivision.
      (2)   Permission to enter.
         (a)   The City Council, Planning Board, Administrator or affected
agencies identified during the pre-application meeting may investigate, examine
and evaluate the site of the proposed subdivision to verify information
provided by the subdivider, and to subsequently monitor compliance with any
conditions if the preliminary plat is approved conditionally.
         (b)   1.   The submission of a subdivision application constitutes a
grant of permission to enter for this purpose.
            2.   This consent also applies to members of the public attending
any noticed public meeting at the site of the proposed subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.030.030) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.030.040 ELEMENT REVIEW.
   (A)   Process. Once the application is submitted to the Administrator, it is
reviewed to determine if it contains all of the required elements according to
following process:
      (1)   A subdivision application is considered to be received on the date
of delivery to the Administrator with the required review fee;
      (2)   Within five working days of receiving the application and review
fee, the Administrator shall determine if the application contains of the
applicable materials;
      (3)   The Administrator’s determination shall be based on whether the
required information is included in the application or is absent from the
application;
      (4)   The Administrator shall send written notice to the subdivider of
the determination. If the application is missing elements, the letter shall
identify the missing elements;
      (5)   The subdivider shall correct deficiencies and submit the required
elements;
      (6)   This process shall be repeated until the subdivider submits an
application containing all the required elements, at which point the
application moves forward to sufficiency review; and
      (7)   If the subdivider does not respond to a request for additional
information within six months of the issuance of the Administrator’s letter,
the Administrator shall send written notice to the subdivider that the
application will be terminated if the items are not addressed within 30 days.
   (B)   Amendments to the application during element review. If the subdivider
alters the application during element review, the application will be reviewed
according to
§ 11.02.050.050(A). If not determined to be material, the application will be
reviewed according to
§ 11.02.030.030, which triggers an additional five-day review period.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.030.040) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.030.050 SUFFICIENCY REVIEW.
   (A)   Process. Once the Administrator determines an application contains the
required elements, the Administrator reviews it to determine whether the
information in the application is sufficient to make a decision to approve the
application, deny it or approve it with conditions according to the following
process.
      (1)   Within 15 working days after the Administrator determines that the
application contains all of the required elements, the Administrator shall
determine whether the application and required elements contain detailed,
supporting information that is sufficient to allow for the review of the
proposed subdivision under these regulations.
      (2)   The Administrator’s determination shall be based upon whether there
is enough information in the application to determine whether the application
meets applicable design criteria and if the subdivision will have a significant
impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the
natural environment, wildlife, wildlife habitat, and public health and safety
and other applicable review criteria.
      (3)   The Administrator shall send written notice to the subdivider of
the determination. If the application is insufficient, the letter shall
identify the deficiencies and information needed for a sufficient application.
      (4)   The subdivider shall correct deficiencies and submit the required
information.
      (5)   This process shall be repeated until the subdivider submits an
application that contains detailed, supporting information that is sufficient
to review the proposed subdivision under the provisions of these regulations.
      (6)   If the subdivider does not respond to a request for additional
information within six months of the issuance of the Administrator’s letter,
the Administrator shall send written notice to the subdivider that the
application will be terminated if the items are not addressed within 30 days.
   (B)   Amendments to the application during sufficiency review. If the
subdivider alters the application during sufficiency review, the application
will be reviewed according to
§ 11.02.050.050. If not determined to be material, the application will be
reviewed according to
§ 11.02.030.040(A), which triggers an additional 15-day review period.
   (C)   Effect of determining an application sufficient.
      (1)   Once the application has been deemed sufficient, the local
government’s statutory deadlines for a decision begin. The statutory deadlines
differ depending upon the type of subdivision and the number of lots. The first
day of the time period begins on the day after the written notice is sent to
the subdivider stating that the application is sufficient. The City Council’s
timeframe for decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny the
application is as follows:
         (a)   Thirty-five working days: minor subdivisions;
         (b)   Sixty working days: major subdivisions with fewer than 50 lots;
and
         (c)   Eighty working days: major subdivisions with 50 or more lots.
      (2)   The time period may be extended or suspended by up to one year upon
mutual consent of the subdivider and the Administrator. Amending an application
after it has been determined sufficient constitutes the subdivider’s consent to
an extension of the time period. The time period is also extended if a
subsequent public hearing is required.
      (3)   Once the application is declared sufficient by the Administrator,
the subdivider shall submit the following paper copies of the application,
including additional materials for element and sufficiency reviews to the
Administrator.
         (a)   Minor subdivisions. One electronic copy in either PDF or
Microsoft Word format, and 11 paper copies in a three-ring binder with tabs for
each section.
         (b)   Major subdivisions. One electronic copy in either PDF or
Microsoft Word format, and 17 paper copies in a three-ring binder with tabs for
each section.
   (D)   Additional information. A determination that an application contains
sufficient information for review as provided in this subchapter does not
ensure that the proposed subdivision will be approved or conditionally approved
by the City Council and does not limit the ability of the Administrator,
Planning Board or the City Council to request additional information during the
review process.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.030.050) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.030.060 AGENCY COMMENTS.
   (A)   General. Once the application is declared to have the required
elements according to
§ 11.02.030.030, the Administrator shall solicit agency comments.
   (B)   Agencies to be contacted.
      (1)   The Administrator shall contact the agencies according to
§ 11.02.030.010(B), identified during the pre-application meeting.
      (2)   If the Administrator contacts additional entities during the review
process, the Administrator shall notify the subdivider of the contact and the
timeframe for response.
   (C)   Comments received. The Administrator shall provide the subdivider with
copies of comments received. The subdivider shall submit copies of any other
comments received, including those from agencies and utilities, to the
Administrator.
   (D)   Limitations of agency comment.
      (1)   As required by MCA § 76-3-504(1)(I), review and comment by public
agencies, utilities or those with a substantial interest may not delay the City
Council’s action on the subdivision application beyond the review period.
Failure of any agency to complete a review of an application may not be a basis
for rejection of the application by the City Council.
      (2)   State or federal governmental entities that have been involved in
an effort to acquire or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real
property of the subdivision are required to disclose that information prior to
submitting comments, opinions or information.
   (E)   Coordination between counties and incorporated municipalities. State
law identifies specific coordination between counties and municipalities. These
requirements are addressed below.
      (1)   When the subdivision lies partly within an incorporated
municipality. If the proposed subdivision lies partly within the city and
partly within the unincorporated area of the county, the application and
preliminary plat must be submitted to and approved by both the city and county
governing bodies. The subdivider is responsible for submitting the application
to both municipal and county governing bodies.
      (2)   Municipalities; when annexation is proposed. If a subdivision or
portion of a subdivision is proposed to be annexed into the city, the following
process shall be followed.
         (a)   If an entire existing parcel is proposed to be annexed and then
subdivided, the subdivider shall submit the proposal to the municipality and
the municipality shall proceed with review for annexation and subdivision. The
municipality shall notify the County Administrator of the proposed annexation
and subdivision. The municipality shall coordinate subdivision and annexation
procedures to minimize duplication of hearings, reports and other requirements
whenever possible. The municipality shall not make an official determination to
approve, approve with conditions or deny a subdivision until the area of the
subdivision is annexed into the city.
         (b)   If the area to be annexed includes only a portion of an existing
tract of record and a portion in the unincorporated area of the county, the
subdivision shall be reviewed by both the county and the municipality. The
following is recommended to coordinate review:
            1.   Administrators for the county and municipality meet as early
as possible to discuss the proposed subdivision, overlapping issues and make a
recommendation on coordination to the governing bodies;
            2.   The governing bodies shall direct the administrators as to the
preferred method of coordination;
            3.   The most coordinated approach is joint review for subdivision
and annexation, with one staff report prepared for both jurisdictions, and with
Planning Board meetings and/or hearings held jointly, and for the governing
bodies to also meet jointly;
            4.   An alternative approach is for each local government to
conduct separate but concurrent reviews, the county for subdivision review and
the municipality for annexation and subdivision. If this alternative is
selected, the local governments shall share all reports and meeting/hearing
notices. The municipality shall coordinate its subdivision and annexation
procedures to minimize duplication of hearings, reports and other requirements
whenever possible; and
            5.   If the governing bodies of the county and municipality approve
of the subdivision to be annexed, the county shall first approve the
subdivision with the condition of annexation; and the municipality shall then
approve the annexation and the subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.030.060) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.030.070 STAFF REPORT.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter discusses the report prepared by the
Administrator to assess the proposed subdivision for compliance with the review
criteria. The staff report also includes a recommendation for approval,
approval with conditions or denial. The staff report is submitted to the
Planning Board for major subdivisions or City Council for minor subdivisions.
   (B)   Contents.
      (1)   The Administrator shall prepare a recommendation and report
evaluating the proposed subdivision and any requested variances for compliance
with these regulations.
      (2)   The staff report shall contain:
         (a)   Recommendation for approval, conditional approval (see
§ 11.02.030.070(C)), including any conditions for mitigation measures, or
denial of the subdivision application and preliminary plat;
         (b)   Summary of the basis for the recommendation, including findings
of fact which describe factual evidence and analysis of compliance with
submittal requirements in §
§ 11.02.030.010 through 11.02.030.110 and the review criteria in §
§ 11.02.050.005 through 11.02.050.060;
         (c)   Recommendation for approval or denial of any requested variances
(based on review criteria for variances in
§ 11.02.050.030), including any conditions of approval, and a summary of facts
forming the basis of the recommendation;
         (d)   Recommended time period of the preliminary plat approval of not
less than one calendar year or more than three calendar years, and any
recommendation regarding extensions (refer to §
§ 11.02.050.005 through 11.02.050.060 for review criteria for determining time
periods and extensions); and
         (e)   Copies of agency comments and public comments received (not
including those already in the subdivision application), including any public
comments regarding water and sanitation information.
   (C)   Conditions of approval. Based on the findings of fact, the staff
report may recommend conditions of approval. Conditions of approval must be
based on the review criteria in §
§ 11.02.050.005 through 11.02.050.060.
   (D)   Timeframe for staff reports. The Administrator shall submit the staff
report to the subdivider and City Council or Planning Board at least seven days
prior to the public meeting or hearing.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.030.070) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.030.080 PUBLIC COMMENT.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter briefly describes general provisions for
public comment with more detail provided in other steps, primarily those
related to Planning Board and City Council review.
   (B)   Public information. Once the application is submitted to the
Administrator, it is public information. Public comment and comments from
public utilities, government agencies and others with a substantial interest in
the subdivision are essential components of the review of the application,
staff report, Planning Board recommendation and City Council decision.
   (C)   Timing of comments.
      (1)   Although identified as a separate step in the process, in fact,
public review may occur at any time during the preliminary plat review process.
Establishing it as a separate process step highlights the importance of these
comments, but does not limit comment to one particular time period in the
review process.
      (2)   Comments received from the public at any time after the application
is submitted will be included in the jurisdiction’s files and records of the
subdivision. Comments will be considered in the staff report, Planning Board
recommendation and City Council decision.
   (D)   Soliciting public comments. Major subdivisions, except those exempted
per MCA § 76-3-616, shall have a public hearing by the Planning Board. Such
hearings shall be noticed as identified in
§ 11.02.030.080(B)(1). Any additional meetings of Planning Board or City
Council will be noticed as meetings. Minor subdivisions shall be noticed as
meetings of the City Council. Notice of meetings shall be made at least 48
hours in advance.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.030.080) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.030.090 PLANNING BOARD REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter addresses how the Planning Board shall hold
public meetings and hearings in order to review and make recommendations upon a
subdivision application. The Planning Board review only applies to major
subdivisions, delegating its responsibilities for minor subdivisions to the
Administrator, as authorized under MCA § 76-1-107(2).
   (B)   Planning Board materials. The Administrator shall forward the
application, staff report, agency comments, subdivider’s preference for
mitigation and any public comments to the Planning Board at least seven days
prior to the scheduled meeting.
   (C)   Planning Board public hearing.
      (1)   Notice requirements. The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing

has held its public hearing, but prior to the City Council meeting.
      (2)   Handling new information.
         (a)   If new and additional information is presented following the
Planning Board’s public hearing regarding the proposed major subdivision, the
Administrator shall review the new information according to the following: any
new information or analysis of information that was presented at the Planning
Board hearing on the subdivision application that the public has had a
reasonable opportunity to examine, and on which the public has had a reasonable
opportunity to comment, shall be forwarded to the City County to proceed with
the decision whether to approve, conditionally approve or deny the proposed
subdivision.
         (b)   If new information or analysis of information has never been
submitted as evidence or considered by the Planning Board at a hearing on the
subdivision application. The City Council shall then:
            1.   Approve, conditionally approve or deny the proposed
subdivision without basing its decision on the new information if the City
Council determines that the information is either not relevant or not credible;
or
            2.   Direct the Planning Board to schedule a subsequent public
hearing for consideration of only the new information that may have an impact
on the findings and conclusions that the City Council will rely upon in making
its decision on the proposed subdivision.
         (c)   In addition to divisions (B)(2)(b)1. and (B)(2)(b)2. above, if
the new information has been submitted by the applicant, the new information
shall be reviewed according to
§ 11.02.050.050 to determine if it is a material change.
      (3)   Subsequent public hearing. If a subsequent public hearing is
required, the review period (60 working days for subdivisions with less than 50
lots and 80 working days for 50 or more lots) is suspended. The new hearing
shall be noticed per requirements of
§ 11.02.030.080 and held within 45 days of the governing body’s determination
to schedule a new hearing. If a subsequent public hearing is determined to be
required, the following shall occur.

compilation of the new information, an addendum to the staff report that
addresses only the new information, and any recommended changes to the Planning
Board’s previous recommendation and findings of fact resulting from the new
information.
         (b)   The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing as described in
§ 11.02.030.090, regarding only the new information. Within ten working days
after the Planning Board’s public hearing, the Planning Board shall submit in
writing to the subdivider and the City Council any changes to the following
information previously submitted:
            1.   Changes to recommendation for approval, conditional approval
(including any recommended conditions and/or mitigation measures) or denial of
the subdivision application and preliminary plat;

§ 11.02.030.110 CITY COUNCIL DECISION.
   (A)   Information to be considered. The City Council’s decision to approve,

staff report and other additional information submitted or prepared in the
review of the subdivision.
   (B)   Review criteria. The basis for the City Council’s decision to approve,

information submitted by the subdivider to support the request, public comment,
Planning Board recommendation, staff report or additional information.
      (2)   The City Council should review the request for variance prior to
finalizing a decision on the subdivision application because the decision on
the variance may affect aspects of the subdivision.
   (D)   Subdivider’s preference for mitigation.
      (1)   The City Council must consult with the subdivider and give due
weight and consideration to the subdivider’s expressed preferences.

subdivider’s preferred mitigation.
      (3)   Any acceptable mitigation must reduce negative impacts to
acceptable levels.

a substantial change in the application, it shall be reviewed according to
§ 11.02.050.050.
   (E)   City Council’s written statement. Pursuant to MCA § 76-3-504(1)(r),

      (5)   Information on the appeal process for denial or imposition of
conditions;
      (6)   Findings of fact that weigh the review criteria;
      (7)   Identification of the regulations and statutes that were used in

already been submitted to the subdivider;
      (9)   Notice to the subdivider that public comments related to water and
sanitation must be included as part of the application for sanitation approval
(as required by MCA § 76-3-604(7)(b)).

City Council to recover actual damages caused by a final action, decision, or
order of the City Council or these regulations that is arbitrary or capricious.
      (2)   A party identified in the following subchapter who is aggrieved by
a decision of the City Council to approve, conditionally approve or deny an

proposed subdivision or a private landowner with property within the county or
municipality where the subdivision is proposed if that landowner can show a
likelihood of material injury to the landowner’s property or its value;
            3.   The County Commissioners of the county where the subdivision
is proposed; and
            4.   Municipalities, as described in MCA § 7-1-4111, if a

(Prior Code, § 11.02.040.030) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016) SUBDIVISION REVIEW
CRITERIA AND AMENDMENT PROCEDURES
§ 11.02.050.005 GENERAL.
   (A)   This chapter addresses review criteria for the following:
      (1)   Approval, conditional approval or denial of preliminary plats;
      (2)   Final plats;
      (3)   Variances; and
      (4)   Extensions of preliminary plat approval
   (B)   This chapter also addresses the amendment procedures for the
following: amending preliminary plat applications amending preliminary plat
approvals after final plat
(Prior Code, § 11.02.050.005) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.050.010 CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL, CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF
PRELIMINARY PLAT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Generally. This subchapter describes the information to be considered
by the City Council in making a decision. It also describes the information to
be considered by the Administrator and Planning Board when making a
recommendation.
   (B)   Information to be considered. In order to approve, conditionally
approve or deny the proposed subdivision, the City Council shall review the
subdivision application, preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment,
public hearing, public comment, Planning Board recommendations, staff report
and other additional information submitted or prepared in the review of the
subdivision.
   (C)   Review criteria.
      (1)   The basis for the City Council’s decision to approve, conditionally
approve or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, Planning
Board recommendations or additional information demonstrates that development
of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of MCA § 76-3-608, and the
criteria below.
      (2)   A City Council may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision
based solely on the subdivision’s impacts on educational services or based
solely on parcels within the subdivision having been designated as wildland-
urban interface parcels under MCA § 76-13-145.
      (3)   The City Council decision shall reflect the following criteria.
         (a)   Impacts to agriculture, agricultural water user facilities,
local services, natural environment, wildlife, wildlife habitat, and public
health and safety. The City Council shall identify any impacts it determines to
be potentially significant and adverse to agriculture, agricultural water user
facilities, local services, natural environment, wildlife, wildlife habitat,
and public health and safety. A description of these criteria are found in
§ 11.02.090.010, Appendix A, which are adopted in the city growth policy, as
required by MCA § 76-1-601(3)(h).
         (b)   Survey requirements. The subdivision shall comply with survey
requirements in the uniform standards for final subdivision plats.
         (c)   Compliance with local subdivision regulations. The review is
based on the subdivision regulations in place at the time the application is
determined to contain sufficient information for review. In addition, the
subdivision regulations require compliance with local zoning and other
applicable regulations. The considerations are:
            1.   Compliance with the design standards in §
§ 11.02.060.010 through 11.02.060.270 is required;
            2.   Special provisions for condominiums, townhouses, townhomes,
and RV and mobile home parks: condominiums, townhouses, townhomes, and RV and
mobile home parks shall meet the additional design standards and requirements
primarily included in §
§ 11.02.030.010 through 11.02.030.110;
            3.   All subdivisions must demonstrate they are designed to comply
with applicable zoning;
            4.   All subdivisions shall demonstrate compliance with other
applicable regulations, such as the ARMs for sanitation and water supply,
public health ordinances, floodplain regulations and the like; and
            5.   Subdivisions should demonstrate conformance to adopted plans,
such as the growth policy, transportation plans, capital improvements plans,
pre-disaster mitigation plans or community wildfire protection plans. Because
plans are not regulatory, no variance for non-conformance shall be required,
nor can denial or a condition of approval be based solely on plan conformance.
         (d)   Subdivision review procedure. All subdivisions shall demonstrate
compliance with the subdivision review procedure, based on the subdivision
regulations in place at the time the application is determined to contain
sufficient information for review. The record shall demonstrate that the
process and timelines in §
§ 11.02.030.010 through 11.02.030.110 were followed.
         (e)   Utility easements. The subdivision shall provide easements
within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and installation of any
planned utilities.
         (f)   Legal and physical access. All subdivisions shall provide legal
and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and the
required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of
transfer containing the parcel.
   (D)   Requiring reasonable mitigation. The City Council may require the
subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to reasonably minimize
potentially significant adverse impacts identified through evaluation of the
review criteria identified in
§ 11.02.050.010(C). The City Council shall issue written findings to justify
the reasonable mitigation required. When requiring mitigation, the City Council
shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration
to the expressed preference of the subdivider.
   (E)   Cause for denial. In reviewing a proposed subdivision and when
requiring mitigation, a City Council may not unreasonably restrict a
landowner’s ability to develop land, but it is recognized that in some
instances, the unmitigated impacts of a proposed development may be
unacceptable and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
   (F)   Special consideration of water and sanitation information. The City
Council may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to MCA § 76-3-622, or
public comment received pursuant to MCA § 76-3-604 on the information provided
pursuant to MCA § 76-3-622, only if the conditional approval or denial is based
on existing subdivision, zoning or other regulations that the City Council has
the authority to enforce.
   (G)   Additional provisions.
      (1)   Waiver of right to protest. A City Council may not require as a
condition of subdivision approval that a property owner waive a right to
protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement
district for capital improvement projects that does not identify the specific
capital improvements for which protest is being waived. A waiver of a right to
protest shall not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the
date that the final subdivision plat is filed with the County Clerk and
Recorder.
      (2)   Well isolation zone. The City Council may not approve a proposed
subdivision if any of the features and improvements of the subdivision encroach
onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise provided for
under MCA 76-3 Part 4 or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be
drilled for the proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private
property, unless the owner of the private property authorizes the encroachment.
The term “well isolation zone” has the meaning provided in MCA § 76-4-102.
      (3)   Federal or state comment. If a federal or state governmental entity
submits a written or oral comment or an opinion regarding wildlife, wildlife
habitat or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for
the purpose of assisting a City Council’s review, the comment or opinion may be
included in the City Council’s written statement under MCA § 76-3-620, only if
the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been
involved in an effort to acquire or assist others in acquiring an interest in
the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose that
the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an
opinion, or information.

§ 11.02.050.030 VARIANCE REVIEW CRITERIA.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter explains how to process variances and the
review criteria they should be reviewed by the following.
   (B)   Variances authorized. The City Council may grant variances from §
§ 11.02.060.010 through 11.02.060.270 when due to the characteristics of land
proposed for subdivision, strict compliance with these standards would result
in undue hardship and would not be essential to the public welfare.
   (C)   Submittal requirements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall include with the preliminary plat application
a written statement describing and justifying the requested variance by
addressing each of the review criteria. The subdivider shall include in the
preliminary plat application a request for variance for each subdivision design
standard that the proposed subdivision does not meet.
      (2)   Contents. The request for variance shall include:
         (a)   Request for variance application form;
         (b)   Review fee;
         (c)   Exact citation of the design standard for the variance
requested; and
         (d)   A summary of the reason for the variance request addressing each
of the review criteria.
   (D)   Review criteria. The subdivider has the burden to prove the strict
application of these regulations would result in an undue hardship upon the
subdivider of the property according to the following:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety, or general welfare or injurious to other adjoining properties;
      (2)   Due to the physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions
of the property involved, strict compliance with the regulations will impose an
undue hardship on the owner. Undue hardship does not include personal or
financial hardship, or any hardship that is self-imposed;
      (3)   The variance will not cause a substantial increase in public costs;
and
      (4)   The variance will not place the subdivision in non-conformance with
any adopted zoning regulations.
   (E)   City Council decision.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   The City Council shall review each variance request to the
review criteria in division (D) above.
         (b)   The City Council will not grant any variance to the requirements
of
§ 11.02.060.070.
      (2)   Conditions. In granting variances, the City Council may impose
reasonable conditions to secure the objectives of these regulations.
      (3)   Findings of fact. Upon granting any variance, the City Council
shall provide a description of the variance and the facts and conditions upon
which the issuance of the variance and any conditions of its approval is based.

§ 11.02.050.040 EXTENSIONS OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   Information to be considered. In considering whether to grant an
extension to the approval period of an approved preliminary plat, the City
Council shall consider the reasons for the request as explained in the
subdivider’s written request for extension and recommendations from the
Administrator. The written request for extension must be received no later than
30 days prior to the end of the preliminary plat approval period.
   (B)   Criteria.
      (1)   Significant changes in regulations. The City Council shall not
issue extensions if the subdivision regulations or other relevant regulations
(e.g., DEQ sanitation requirements) have changed significantly since
preliminary plat approval. Significant changes constitute those that would
render the subdivision non-compliant with design standards or where current
mitigation requirements are more stringent than when the subdivision received
approval.
      (2)   Three-year maximum time for each extension. Extensions shall be for
no longer than three-year increments.
   (C)   Extensions to be in writing. Any mutually agreed upon extension must
be in writing and dated and signed by the members of the City Council and the
subdivider or subdivider’s agent. The document must be dated within the time
frame of the preliminary plat approval.

constitutes new information, follow the procedures in
§ 11.02.030.090(B) to determine if a subsequent hearing is required; and
      (6)   If the Administrator determines the changes are material, the
Administrator shall either require the subdivider to schedule a new pre-
application meeting and resubmit the application and preliminary plat as a new
subdivision application or proceed with a subsequent public hearing in
according to
§ 11.02.030.090(B) upon confirmation from the Administrator that the
application has the required elements and is sufficient for review.
   (C)   Amending an approved preliminary plat. If the subdivider proposes to
change the preliminary plat after the preliminary plat approval, but before the
final plat approval, the subdivider shall submit the proposed changes to the
Administrator for review. The Administrator should review the changes as
follows.
      (1)   Within five working days of receiving the proposed changes, the
Administrator shall determine whether the changes to the preliminary plat are
material pursuant to division (D) below.
      (2)   If the Administrator determines the changes are material, the
Administrator may either require a public hearing with the applicable body for
majors or a meeting with the City Council for minors.
      (3)   If the changes are extensive, the Administrator may require the
subdivider to begin the subdivision review process again, starting with the
pre-application meeting and require payment of a new application fee.
      (4)   If the subdivider and Administrator determine that a condition of
approval is illegal or impossible to comply with due to circumstances outside
the subdivider’s control, the condition may be reviewed by the City Council
through a properly noticed public meeting or hearing, as applicable, in order
to determine if the condition may be waived or amended.
   (D)   Determining a material change.
      (1)   Changes to a preliminary plat application. Changes made to a
preliminary plat application may be considered material if:
         (a)   If it is determined to impact the element or sufficiency of
subdivision’s preliminary plat application under §
§ 11.02.030.030 and 11.02.030.040;
         (b)   If it has an impact on the primary review criteria in
§ 11.02.050.010;
         (c)   If it brings the proposal out of conformance with the zoning or
the design standards in these regulations;
         (d)   If the changes impact the accuracy of other information provided
in support of a preliminary plat application; and
         (e)   If it changes any of the following information:
            1.   If the changes impact the configuration or number of lots;
            2.   If the changes impact the park land or open spaces;
            3.   If the changes impact the water and/or wastewater treatment
system proposals;
            4.   If the changes impact the easement provisions, access and
streets; and
            5. If the changes impact the proposed land uses or covenants.
      (2)   Changes to an approved preliminary plat. Changes made to an
approved preliminary plat application may be considered material if:
         (a)   If the changes impact the configuration or number of lots;
         (b)   If the changes impact the park land or open spaces;
         (c)   If the changes impact the water and/or wastewater treatment

preliminary plat has been deemed materially changed by the Administrator may
appeal the Administrator’s decision to the City Council. The subdivider may
request a public meeting with the City Council for minor subdivisions, or a
public hearing with the City Council for major subdivisions and may submit
additional evidence to show that the changes to the preliminary plat are not
material.
      (1)   The applicable review period is suspended until the City Council’s
decision on the appeal is made.
      (2)   If the City Council concludes that the evidence and information
demonstrate that the changes to the subdivision application or preliminary plat
are material, the City Council shall either require the subdivider to schedule
a new pre-application meeting and resubmit the application and preliminary plat
as a new subdivision application, or proceed with a subsequent public hearing
according to
§ 11.02.030.090(C), upon confirmation from the Administrator that the
application has the required elements and is sufficient for review.
      (3)   If the City Council concludes that the evidence and information
demonstrate that the changes to the subdivision application or preliminary plat
are not material, the applicable review period resumes as of the date of the
decision.

(Prior Code, § 11.02.060.060) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.060.070 FLOODPLAIN PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to reduce risks to public
health, safety and property damage from flood events that may impact or be
impacted by new development associated with subdivisions.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   This subchapter applies to subdivisions that are intended for
placement of new buildings or other development in the vicinity of a 100-year
floodplain. The 100-year floodplains are depicted on the adopted flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMs) published by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). As of the date of these regulations, the 100-year floodplains
include both Approximate Zone A 100-year floodplains and other zones designated
as 100- year floodplains by detailed study. The Approximate Zone A base flood
elevations (BFEs) have not been determined, while other 100-year floodplain
zones designated by detailed study have BFEs that have been determined.
      (2)   It is the intent of this subchapter that any subdivision containing
areas within a 100-year floodplain include sufficient information to
demonstrate the location of all development in relation to the actual
delineated BFE.
   (C)   General provision. Land located in the floodway of a 100-year flood
event as defined by MCA Title 76, § 5, or other land determined by the City
Council to be subject to flooding may not be subdivided for building or
residential purposes or other uses that may increase or aggravate flood hazards
to life, health or welfare, or that may be prohibited by state or local
floodplain regulations.
   (D)   Determining base flood elevations (BFE).
      (1)   For areas where BFE is determined. For areas where the BFE has been
identified as part of flood studies and maps adopted by the City Council that
are within the jurisdiction of the local floodplain regulations:
         (a)   The areas at and below the BFE shall be identified on the
preliminary plat as a flood hazard area. The flood hazard area shall be
identified on the final plat as a no build zone;
         (b)   Any improvements within a flood hazard area, 100-year floodplain
or the floodway within the jurisdiction of the local floodplain regulations
shall meet the requirements of the local floodplain regulations prior to final
plat approval; and
         (c)   Interpretation of floodplain boundary, if the property owner
believes the subject property has been inadvertently included in the 100-year
floodplain, the property owner may provide information and request a
determination from the Floodplain Administrator, adhering to applicable
provisions for such determinations in the floodplain regulations.
      (2)   For areas where BFE is not determined. If any portion of a proposed
subdivision is within 1,000 horizontal feet and ten vertical feet of the
ordinary high water mark of a watercourse draining an area of 25 square miles
or more, and no official floodway delineation or floodway studies of the
watercourse have been made, or within 2,000 horizontal feet and 20 vertical
feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Clark Fork River where no official
floodway delineation or floodway studies have been made, the subdivider shall
do one of the following:
         (a)   Identify the area less than 1,000 horizontal feet and less than
ten vertical feet of the ordinary high water mark of a watercourse draining an
area of 25 square miles or more as a flood hazard area on the preliminary plat.
This area shall be shown on the final plat as a no build zone (Figure 5);
         (b)   If on the Clark Fork River, identify the area less than 2,000
horizontal feet and less than 20 vertical feet of the ordinary high water mark
of the river as a flood hazard area on the preliminary plat. This area shall be
shown on final plat as a no build zone; or
         (c)   Complete an engineering study that identifies the BFE. This
detailed evaluation must be performed by a professional engineer registered in
the state experienced in this field of work.
            1.   A copy of the study identifying the BFE shall be submitted
with the preliminary plat application to the local Administrator.
               a.   The Administrator shall forward the study to the Floodplain
Administrator and the Water Resources Division of the Montana Department of
Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) for comment.
               b.   The City Council shall not delay the preliminary plat
review process to wait for comments. Any comments received by the city shall be
forwarded to the subdivider.
            2.   a.   The areas at and below the BFE shall be identified as
flood hazard areas.
               b.   The flood hazard area shall be identified on the final plat
as a no build zone.

   (E)   Standards.
      (1)   General criteria.
         (a)   When applicable, BFEs and the boundary of the 100-year
floodplain must be considered during lot layout and building location design
(44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b)(3));
         (b)   Locations for future structures and development must be
reasonably safe from flooding (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(a)(4));
         (c)   Streets, utilities and similar facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems must be located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(a)(4)(ii));
         (d)   Adequate surface water drainage must be provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(a)(4)(iii));
         (e)   All subdivisions and development activities within the 100-year
floodplain are subject to the city’s floodplain regulations; and
         (f)   Floodplain development permits must be obtained according to the
city’s floodplain regulations before development occurs within the 100-year
floodplain (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b)).
      (2)   Design standards.
         (a)   Lots. 
            1.   The desired design standard of lots for residential or
building purposes shall include no portion of nor be immediately adjacent to
the 100-year floodplain.
            2.   If that is not achievable due to site constraints, lots may
contain areas in the 100-year floodplain, but each lot must have an area
outside of the floodplain suitable for the lot’s intended purposes.
         (b)   Access. The subdivider shall demonstrate that safe access to the
designated building site(s) is possible during a 100-year flood.
         (c)   Infrastructure. 
            1.   Subdivisions should be designed to avoid placing subdivision-
related infrastructure (streets, bridges, utilities and the like) within the
boundaries of the 100-year floodplain.
            2.   Where there is no alternative to placement within the
floodplain, streets and utilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems that must be located in the 100-year floodplain shall be designed and
installed so as to minimize or eliminate flood damage and not adversely affect
public health and safety.
         (d)   Bridges. Bridges within the 100-year floodplain shall be
designed so the lowest horizontal chord of the bridge is at least two feet
above the BFE.
   (F)   Final plat and noticing requirements. The City Council may require
final plats of subdivisions with areas located within a 100-year floodplain to
provide notice of any or all of the following:
      (1)   Locations of boundaries of the 100-year floodplain and floodway
based on where the BFEs intersect surveyed ground elevations;
      (2)   Elevation of the existing ground;
      (3)   Flood water depths;
      (4)   The required lowest floor elevation for each building site;
      (5)   Lot owners’ responsibility for obtaining a floodplain development
permit according to the city’s floodplain regulations before development occurs
within a 100-year floodplain;
      (6)   Lot owners’ responsibility for complying with any specific
provisions of the city’s floodplain regulations; and
      (7)   Applicable information regarding flood insurance.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.060.070) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.060.080 LOT DESIGN.
   (A)   Each lot intended for building purposes must contain a satisfactory
building site and conform to applicable zoning regulations, other adopted codes
and regulations, and these regulations.
   (B)   The following design standards apply to all lots intended for building
purposes:
      (1)   No single lot may be divided by a municipal boundary line;
      (2)   No single lot may contain portions divided by another parcel or
public right-of-way;
      (3)   Each lot must abut and have direct access to a public or private
street or road. When an alley is used to provide access, another primary access
must be available to the lot;
      (4)   Corner lots must be of sufficient area to provide acceptable
visibility for traffic safety;
      (5)   No lot may have an average depth greater than five times its
average width;
      (6)   Side lot lines must be at substantially right angles to street or
road lines and radial to curved street or road lines;
      (7)   Through lots (a.k.a., double-frontage lots) are prohibited, except
where essential to provide separation of development from traffic arteries or
to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation;
      (8)   All lots shall be developable in compliance with the city zoning;
and
      (9)   The preliminary plat application shall demonstrate each lot can be
developed with the intended purpose as allowed by the zoning ordinance and meet
all standards of the zoning ordinance.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.060.080) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.060.090 SUBDIVISION LAYOUTS.
   (A)   Blocks. Subdivisions creating a new area or neighborhood in the city
shall be laid out using a development pattern with blocks similar to the city’s
current development pattern, which provides traffic-control, safety and
circulation, as well as efficient development. To assure the city’s development
continues with an efficient pattern, the following design standards apply to
all subdivisions containing blocks:
      (1)   Block lengths shall not exceed 500 feet as measured from
consecutive right-of-ways; and
      (2)   Blocks must be wide enough to allow for two tiers of lots with
alleys between the two tiers, except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries with parks or open spaces between
residential lots and the applicable street.
   (B)   Relation to existing streets and neighborhoods. The subdivider shall
arrange new streets for their continuation to adjacent streets and
neighborhoods when continuation is deemed necessary by the City Council for the
convenient dispersal and movement of traffic, connection of neighborhoods,
effective provision of emergency services and utilities.
   (C)   Relation to unsubdivided areas. When a proposed subdivision adjoins
land that, in the estimation of the City Council, is likely to be subdivided in
the future and has the ability to efficiently connect existing, currently
separated streets or roads, the subdivider shall provide one or more easement
for the logical continuation of the subdivision street(s) and utilities to the
adjacent land.
      (1)   This requirement shall not apply when access is otherwise available
in a manner adequate to provide for the future convenient dispersal and
movement of traffic, connection of neighborhoods, effective provision of
emergency services, and provision of utilities.
      (2)   This requirement may be waived by the City Council when at least
one of the following criteria is met:
         (a)   Topography or other physical conditions would make it
impractical to provide access to adjacent unsubdivided land; or
         (b)   When the adjoining unsubdivided land is under public ownership,
is subject to a conservation easement, deed restriction or some other situation
exists where the future subdivision and development of that land is unlikely.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.060.090) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.060.100 SUBSTANDARD STREETS LEADING TO A SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   When a substandard street is used to access a subdivision, the City
Council shall consider the two options below for improving the street(s) and
choose the option that in its estimation is most likely to result in:
      (1)   Improved safety and efficiency along the road(s); and
      (2)   Equitable distribution of the costs related to the extension of
capital facilities.
   (B)   The most obvious travel route(s) due to convenience and destinations
shall be used for determining traffic flows and counts.
      (1)   Option 1 (generally for major subdivisions, but may be applied to
minors).
         (a)   Where a subdivision is accessed by a substandard street, the
subdivider shall be required to contribute to the local jurisdiction an amount
equal to the proportional share of the improvements necessary to bring said
street(s) up to city standards, or the standards for the relevant functional
classification as identified in these subdivision regulations.
         (b)   The cost of improvements shall be determined by a state licensed
consulting engineer who shall identify the street deficiencies and estimate
materials, labor and other cost items necessary to bring the street(s) to the
determined standard. Costs of the engineering services shall be borne by the
subdivider.
         (c)   The subdivider’s proportional cost shall be found by adding
current traffic counts (average daily trips or ADT) from the street(s) to the
projected traffic to be generated by the subdivision, then dividing the
projected subdivision traffic count by the total. (See example below.)
            1.   Traffic counts shall be determined by recent counts by the
jurisdiction, if available, or by an independent agent to collect traffic count
data over a one week period and may be required to be adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.
            2.   The independent agent shall be selected with approval from the
Administrator and Public Works Department.
            3.   Costs are to be paid by the subdivider.
            4.   Traffic count location(s) shall be determined by the
Administrator and Public Works Department.
         (d)   As determined by the City Council, the subdivider’s funds will
either:
            1.   Be deposited into an account held by the city in a dedicated
fund for the street improvements and will be used only for improvements to the
substandard street(s); or
            2.   The subdivider will use the funds to make the specified
improvements to the substandard street(s) prior to final plat filing or under a
public improvements agreement.
 
Example
Current ADT on first street                                                     500
Projected ADT increase from subdivision                                         +
                                                                                250
Total current and projected ADT                                                 750
250 ÷ 750 = 0.33: Therefore, the subdivider is responsible for 33% of the cost
of bringing first street up to city standards
 
      (2)   Option 2 (generally for minor subdivisions, but may be applied to
majors). Where a subdivision is accessed by a substandard public street, as a
condition of plat approval, the City Council may require the future lot owners
to waive their right to protest the formation of a special improvement district
related to access and related drainage improvements that will benefit the
future owners.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.060.100) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.060.110 PAYBACK OR LATECOMERS AGREEMENT.
   (A)   For improvements that a subdivider constructs beyond those that are
directly attributable to the subdivision, including those used to access other
unsubdivided or subdivided lands, the subdivider may request a payback or
latecomers agreement in order to provide a mechanism for reimbursement for a
portion of the costs the subdivider incurs which are not directly attributable
to impacts caused by the subdivision.
   (B)   Payback funds would be exacted from future subdividers and others who
directly benefit from the capital improvements (see
§ 11.02.100.010, Appendix B for a sample latecomers agreement).
(Prior Code, § 11.02.060.110) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.060.120 MAINTENANCE OF SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   All public improvements that serve subdivisions shall be
maintained by the owners of property served by the improvements, unless the
improvements are dedicated to, accepted and maintained by a public entity, such
as the city.
      (2)   All dedications and maintenance of improvements to the city are
subject to approval by the City Council, which reserves the right to reject any
proposed dedication and maintenance requests and require another form of
dedication and private maintenance.
   (B)   (1)   Generally, streets in and serving new subdivisions shall be
dedicated to the city.
      (2)   The primary exceptions to this requirement are shared residential
drives that serve up to two single-family residential lots.
         (a)   Such shared residential drives may be maintained as governed by
a legally enforceable private agreement between the two lot owners served by
the improvements.
         (b)   Draft private agreement(s) for the shared improvements shall be
submitted with the preliminary plat application, are subject to review and
approval by the city, and shall be recorded along with the final plat.
         (c)   A sample shared maintenance agreement is included in the
administrative materials of these regulations.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.060.120) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.060.130 STREET DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   General design. The arrangement, type, extent, width, grade, materials
and location of all streets shall be considered in their relation to existing
and planned streets, topographical conditions, maintenance considerations, the
delivery of emergency services, public convenience and safety, and the proposed
uses of the land to be served by them.
   (B)   Applicability. All off-site and on-site streets providing the primary
access to a proposed subdivision and subdivision lots shall meet the standards
contained herein, including those listed in Table 1, except as allowed by
variance.
   (C)   Half streets. Half streets are prohibited, except when they are
essential to the development of the subdivision and when the City Council is
satisfied that the other half of the street will be dedicated to the public
when the neighboring property is subdivided. When an existing half street is
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street must be
platted within the new subdivision.
   (D)   Frontage accesses. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing
or proposed arterial or collector street, the subdivider may be required to
provide a frontage access with a reservation prohibiting access along the
arterial or collector street right-of-way, with screening plantings or other
such treatment as may be necessary for the protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   (E)   Dead-end streets. The following provisions apply to dead-end streets.
      (1)   Dead-end streets are only allowed if they are shared residential
drives (50-foot maximum length) or local streets (500-foot maximum length).
Measurements shall be made from the edge of the intersecting street right-of-
way to the end of the dead-end street or turn-around right-of-way.
      (2)   Alleys are not allowed to dead-end and must be served by other
streets at both ends.
      (3)   Except for shared residential drives, no dead-end street shall be
permitted without an approved turn-around. Where dead-end streets terminate,
the developer shall provide either a cul-de-sac bulb or “T” turn-around at the
terminus. Modified “T” turn-arounds are also allowed; provided they allow for
three-point turn-arounds for the largest Fire Department vehicle. Shared
residential drives that share an approach and drive for 50 linear feet or less
as measured from the edge of the intersecting street are not subject to the
requirement to provide a turnaround area.
      (4)   Where it is planned that a dead-end street will be extended for a
future phase or subdivision, a temporary cul-de-sac bulb or “T” turn-around
shall be provided and a right-of-way of appropriate width shall be shown on the
preliminary and final plat to the adjoining phase or subdivision property.
      (5)   Cul-de-sac bulbs and “T” turn-arounds must also conform to the
design specifications in Table 1.
      (6)   Sufficient right-of-way for turn-around areas and associated
stormwater drainage facilities shall be provided, which at a minimum shall be
consistent with the street right-of-way width.
   (F)   Multiple access points required. To facilitate access by emergency
vehicles and to allow an escape route for occupants in emergency situations,
all streets over 500 feet in length and all subdivisions located in high fire
hazard areas as determined by the Fire Department or other fire authority shall
be designed such that the legal and physical access street(s) serving all lots
provide multiple access points to the public transportation network.
   (G)   Intersections. The following requirements shall apply to street
intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. No street shall intersect any other street at less than a 75
degree angle.
      (2)   The intersections of more than two streets at one point shall be
avoided, except as described in this division this division (G).
      (3)   Two streets meeting a third street from opposite sides shall meet
at the same point or their centerlines shall be off-set by a minimum of 125
feet for local streets and residential drives and 300 feet for collectors or
arterials.
      (4)   Where any gravel street intersects a hard-surfaced street, the
gravel street shall have a hard surface for a minimum of 30 feet from the hard-
surfaced street.
      (5)   Intersection design must provide acceptable visibility for traffic
safety as dictated by the designed operating speeds on the individual streets.
   (H)   Street construction. All streets shall be constructed to the latest
edition of the Montana Public Works Standard Specifications.

required depending upon parking configuration (parallel, diagonal,
perpendicular and the like). A minimum of 8 feet of additional width is
required on each side of the street where parking is allowed. If parking is not
allowed along the arterial, it shall be signed with approved no parking signs.
 
   (J)   Bridges and culverts.
      (1)   Bridges or culverts shall be provided where drainage channels and
waterways intersect any street right-of-way or approach. Guard rails shall also
be installed on bridges. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs of
such improvements subject to MCA § 7-14-2204 and other applicable statutes. For
any improvements required to be constructed and/or maintained by the Board of
County Commissioners, the preliminary plat application shall include the
subdivider’s proposal to ensure the improvements are installed in accordance
with state law and applicable regulations, along with comments on the proposal
from the Board of County Commissioners. All proposals for the installations and
related improvements are subject to approval by the Board of County
Commissioners and City Council prior to final plat approval.
      (2)   Bridges and culverts shall be designed by a registered engineer to
be appropriately sized in accordance with the drainage.
      (3)   Bridges shall be constructed to HS25 load standards and shall be
the same width as the street.
      (4)   Bridges within the 100-year floodplain shall be designed so the
lowest horizontal chord of the bridge is at least two feet above the base flood
elevation.
      (5)   All bridge and culvert installations shall be approved by the city,
which may consult with contracted agents to ensure adequacy.
      (6)   All bridges within the city are subject to review and approval by

   (H)   Utilities placed in the street right-of-way shall be located between
the street and the right-of-way line, except where utilities cross the streets
at approximately right angles.
   (I)   When a utility is to be located in an existing, dedicated right-of-
way, permission must be obtained from the City Council, or local or state
highway authority.
   (J)   (1)   The subdivider shall describe, dimension and show any new public
utility easements in the subdivision on the final plat in their true and
correct location.
      (2)   The public utility easements must be of sufficient width to allow
the physical placement and unobstructed maintenance of public utility
facilities for the provision of public utility services within the subdivision.
   (K)   In addition to showing the location of any utility easement on the
final plat, the following statement must be on any final plat with new utility
easement(s):
“The undersigned hereby grants unto each and every person, firm or corporation,
whether public or private, providing or offering to provide telephone,
telecommunications, electric power, gas, cable television, water or sewer
service to the public, the right to the joint use of an easement for the
construction, maintenance, repair, and removal of their lines and other
facilities, in, over, under and across each area designated on this plat as
‘Utility Easement’ to have and to hold forever.”

§ 11.02.060.240 PARK LAND DEDICATION; CASH IN LIEU; WAIVERS; ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Except as provided below, the final plat of a residential subdivision
must show that the subdivider has dedicated to the city a cash or land donation
equal to:
      (1)   Eleven percent of the area of the land proposed to be subdivided
into parcels of one-half acre or smaller;
      (2)   Seven and one-half percent of the area of the land proposed to be
subdivided into parcels larger than one-half acre and not larger than one acre;
      (3)   Five percent of the area of the land proposed to be subdivided into
parcels larger than one acre and not larger than three acres; and
      (4)   Two and one-half percent of the area of the land proposed to be
subdivided into parcels larger than three acres and not larger than five acres.
   (B)   A park dedication is not required for:
      (1)   Land proposed for subdivision into parcels larger than five acres;
      (2)   Subdivision into parcels that are all non-residential;
      (3)   A subdivision in which parcels are not created, except when that
subdivision provides permanent multiple spaces for recreational camping
vehicles, mobile homes, condominiums or townhomes/townhouses;
      (4)   Subdivisions which will create only one additional parcel; or
      (5)   Minor subdivisions.
   (C)   (1)   The City Council, in consultation with the subdivider and the
Planning Board or Park Board that has jurisdiction, may determine suitable
locations for parks and playgrounds and, giving due weight and consideration to
the expressed preference of the subdivider, may determine whether the park
dedication must be a land donation, cash donation or a combination of both.
      (2)   When a combination of land donation and cash donation is required,
the cash donation may not exceed the proportional amount not covered by the
land donation.
   (D)   The land dedicated for park use may be inside or outside the
boundaries of the proposed subdivision.
   (E)   The City Council will waive the park dedication requirement if it
determines that:
      (1)   The preliminary plat provides for a planned unit development or
other development with land permanently set aside for park and recreational
uses sufficient to meet the needs of the persons who will ultimately reside in
the development; and the area of the land and any improvements set aside for
park and recreational purposes equals or exceeds the area of the dedication
required under division (A) above;
      (2)   The proposed subdivision will provide for the long-term protection
of critical wildlife habitat; cultural, historical or natural resources;
agricultural interests; or aesthetic values; and by virtue of providing this
long-term protection, will result in the reduction of the area of the land
proposed to be subdivided by an amount equal to or exceeding the area that
would have had to be dedicated under division (A) above;
      (3)   The area of the land proposed to be subdivided, by virtue of a
combination of the provisions of this division (E), is reduced by an amount
equal to or exceeding the area of the dedication required under division (A)
above; or
      (4)   The subdivider provides for land outside of the subdivision to be
set aside for park and recreational uses sufficient to meet the needs of the
persons who will ultimately reside in the subdivision; and the area of the land
and any improvements set aside for park and recreational uses equals or exceeds
the area of dedication required under division (A) above.
   (F)   The City Council may waive the park dedication requirement if:
      (1)   The subdivider provides land outside the subdivision that affords
long-term protection of critical wildlife habitat, cultural, historical or
natural resources, agricultural interests, or aesthetic values; and
      (2)   The area of the land to be subject to long-term protection, as
provided in division (F)(1) above, equals or exceeds the area of dedication
required under division (A) above.
   (G)   Subject to the approval of the City Council and acceptance by the
school district trustees, a subdivider may dedicate a land donation provided
under division (A) above to a school district, adequate to be used for school
facilities or buildings.
   (H)   The City Council will administer funds dedicated to the public under
this subchapter in accordance with MCA § 76-3-621(5).
   (I)   For the purposes of this subchapter, CASH DONATION means the fair
market value of the unsubdivided, unimproved land.

§ 11.02.060.250 WATER COURSE AND IRRIGATION EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Except as noted in division (B) below, the subdivider shall establish
within the subdivision, ditch easements that:
      (1)   Are in locations of appropriate topographic characteristics and
sufficient width to allow the physical placement and unobstructed maintenance
of open ditches or below ground pipelines for the delivery of water for
irrigation to persons and lands legally entitled to the water under an
appropriated water right or permit of an irrigation district or other private
or public entity formed to provide for the use of the water right on the
subdivision lots;
      (2)   Are a sufficient distance from the centerline of the ditch to allow
for construction, repair, maintenance and inspection of the ditch; and
      (3)   Prohibit the placement of structures or the planting of vegetation,
other than grass within the ditch easement without the written permission of
the ditch owner.
   (B)   The subdivider need not establish irrigation easements as provided in
division (A) above if:
      (1)   The average lot size in the proposed subdivision will be one acre
or less and the subdivider provides for disclosure, in a manner acceptable to
the City Council, notifying potential buyers that lots within the subdivision
are classified as irrigated land and may continue to be assessed for irrigation
water delivery even though the water may not be deliverable to the lots; or
      (2)   The water rights have been removed from the land within the
subdivision or the process has been initiated to remove the water rights from
the subdivided land through an appropriate legal or administrative process, and
if the removal or intended removal is denoted on the preliminary plat; and
      (3)   (a)   The fact the water rights have been or will be removed from
the land within the subdivision is denoted on the preliminary plat.
         (b)   If the removal of water rights has not been completed at the
time the final plat is filed, the subdivider shall provide written notification
to prospective buyers of the subdivider’s intention to remove the water right
and shall document that intent, when applicable, in agreements and legal
documents for related sales transactions.
   (C)   The subdivider shall, unless otherwise provided under separate written
agreement or recorded easement, show on the preliminary and final plat, and
record with the County Clerk and Recorder, ditch easements for the unobstructed
use and maintenance of existing water delivery ditches, pipelines and
facilities in the proposed subdivision that are necessary to convey water
through the subdivision to lands adjacent to or beyond the subdivision
boundaries in quantities, and in a manner that are consistent with historic and
legal rights.

§ 11.02.060.260 DISPOSITION OF WATER RIGHTS.
   If a subdivision will create lots averaging less than five acres in size,
the subdivider shall submit evidence with the final plat that the subdivider
has:
   (A)   Reserved all or a portion of the appropriation water rights owned by
the owner of the land to be subdivided and transfer these water rights to a
single entity for use by landowners within the subdivision who have a legal
right to the water, and reserved and severed any remaining surface water rights
from the land;
   (B)   If the land to be subdivided is subject to a contract or interest in a
public or private entity formed to provide the use of a water right on the
subdivision lots, established a landowner’s water use agreement administered
through a single entity that specifies administration and the rights and
responsibilities of landowners within the subdivision who have a legal right
and access to the water; or
   (C)   Reserved and severed all surface water rights from the land being
subdivided.

EXEMPTIONS
§ 11.02.070.010 EXEMPTIONS; GENERALLY.
   (A)   The MSPA provides miscellaneous exemptions for some divisions of land,
which are found in MCA Title 76, Part 2, Section 3.
      (1)   These divisions are exempt from local subdivision review and
approval by the city, and are therefore not subject to the review requirements
or design standards of these regulations.
      (2)   However, pursuant to MCA § 76-3-504(1)(p), local subdivision
regulations, must, at a minimum, establish criteria that the City Council or
reviewing authority will use to determine whether proposed methods of
disposition, using the exemptions provided in MCA §§ 76-3-201 or 76-3-207, are
attempts to evade the MSPA.
   (B)   This chapter establishes the criteria and the administrative processes
for exempt divisions of land in the city.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.070.010) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.070.020 GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Advisory examination. Landowners or their representatives are
encouraged to meet with the Administrator to discuss whether a proposed
exemption is in compliance with the MSPA and the criteria of this subchapter
prior to submitting documents claiming an exemption.
   (B)   Submittal and administration.
      (1)   Any person (“claimant” herein) claiming an exemption listed under
§ 11.02.070.030(A), (B), (C), (D), (E) and (F) shall submit to the city for
examination by the Administrator, a draft certificate of survey, amended plat
or, where a survey is not required, a draft instrument of conveyance and
evidence of entitlement to the claimed exemption (see Figure 9 for the general
procedural steps). Additional submittal requirements specific to certain types
of exemptions are listed in
§ 11.02.070.030(A), (B), (C), (D), (E) and (F).

IMAGES/0-0-0-73.png]
      (2)   The Administrator shall review the document(s) and may consult with
the City Attorney, Public Works Supervisor, and other staff and officials
(e.g., the County Clerk and Recorder, examining land surveyor, Montana DEQ,
City Council and the like). The exemption shall be examined within 30 calendar
days of submittal to determine whether it complies with the requirements set
forth in this chapter, the MSPA and the Montana Sanitation in Subdivisions Act.
      (3)   (a)   If the Administrator finds that the proposed use of the
exemption complies with the statutes and applicable criteria, the Administrator
shall advise the claimant and the County Clerk and Recorder that the applicable
documents may be filed.
         (b)   If the Administrator finds the proposed use of the exemption
does not comply with the statues and the criteria in this chapter, the
Administrator shall advise the claimant and the County Clerk and Recorder of
the decision, return the original documents to the claimant, and may retain a
copy of the documents.
      (4)   After review and approval of the applicable documents by the
Administrator and examining land surveyor (if applicable), and when all
appropriate signatures are in place, the proper documents shall be filed with
the County Clerk and Recorder’s office within one calendar year of the
notification from the Administrator that the applicable documents may be filed.
      (5)   If the use of an exemption is denied, the landowner may initiate
the process to apply for subdivision review subject to the requirements of
these and other applicable regulations.
      (6)   Any person whose proposed use of exemption has been denied by the
Administrator may appeal the Administrator’s decision to the City Council.
         (a)   The person may request a meeting with the City Council and may
submit additional evidence to show that the use of the exemption in question is
appropriate and not intended to evade the MSPA, and, thereby overcome any
presumption of evasion.
         (b)   If the City Council concludes that the evidence and information
overcomes the presumption that the exemption is being invoked to evade the MSPA
or otherwise finds the exemption appropriate, the City Council may authorize
the use of the exemption in writing.
         (c)   A survey claiming such an exemption from subdivision review (or
an instrument of conveyance if no survey is required), which otherwise is in
proper form and approved by the examining land surveyor (if applicable), may be
filed if it is accompanied by written authorization of the City Council.
   (C)   Exemption evasion criteria.
      (1)   When determining whether an exemption is claimed for the purpose of
evading the MSPA, the Administrator (and City Council when considering
appeals), shall consider all of the surrounding circumstances. These
circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the nature of the claimant’s
business, the prior history of the particular tract in question, the proposed
configuration of the tracts if the proposed exempt transaction(s) is completed,
and any pattern of exempt transactions that will result in the equivalent of a
subdivision without local government review (State ex rel. Dreher v. Fuller, 50
Mont. St. Rep. 349, 257 Mont. 445, (1993)).
      (2)   Exempt divisions of land that would result in a pattern of
development equivalent to a subdivision may be presumed to be adopted for
purposes of evading the MSPA based on the surrounding circumstances in division
(C)(1) above.
      (3)   When determining whether an exemption is claimed for the purpose of
evading the MSPA, the Administrator (and City Council when considering
appeals), shall consider the review criteria outlined for the specific
exemptions listed in
§ 11.02.070.030.
   (D)   Requirements for exemptions.
      (1)   All parcels and the use of all parcels created or amended through
the use of an exemption shall comply with the city zoning ordinance, or the
degree of non-conformity shall not be expanded. For example, a lot smaller than
the zoning regulations’ minimum lot size requirement may not be made smaller,
but may maintain the non-conforming lot size or be made larger; similarly, a
lot with a boundary that has a non-conforming structure within the required
setback may not be altered in a manner that would cause the boundary to become
closer to that structure.
      (2)   For purposes of this chapter, a tract of record becomes created
when a new tract of record becomes of record, such as when a single tract is
divided into two tracts. Boundary line relocations that start with two tracts
and result in two tracts do not create new tracts.
      (3)   The city may not require lots resulting from exempt divisions to
comply with §
§ 11.02.060.010 through 11.02.060.270, unless the exemption seeks to alter a
lot that was subject to the design and improvement standards of the subdivision
regulations during subdivision review. An exemption that seeks to alter a lot
that was subject to the design and improvement standards of the subdivision
regulations during subdivision review, which would place the lot(s) out of
compliance with those standards, would require approval of a variance pursuant
to §
§ 11.02.030.110(B) and 11.02.050.030.
      (4)   To exempt divisions and/or remaining parcels of land resulting from
the exemptions in MCA § 76-3-207 from the survey requirements of MCA § 76-3-
401, the parcel(s) must be able to be described as a 1/32 or larger aliquot
part of a United States government section.
      (5)   Subject to the following, a division of land exempt from
subdivision review by MCA § 76-3-207 (a gift or sale to a member of the
immediate family, exemption for agricultural purposes or relocation of common
boundaries) may not be made, unless the County Treasurer has certified that all
real property taxes and special assessments assessed and levied on the land to
be divided have been paid.
         (a)   1.   If a division of land includes centrally assessed property
and the property taxes applicable to the division of land are not specifically
identified in the tax assessment, the Department of Revenue shall prorate the
taxes applicable to the land being divided on a reasonable basis.
            2.   The owner of the centrally assessed property shall ensure that
the pro rated real property taxes and special assessments are paid on the land
being sold before the division of land is made.
         (b)   The County Treasurer may accept the amount of the tax prorated
pursuant to division (D) above as a partial payment of the total tax that is
due.
(Prior Code, § 11.02.070.020) (Ord. 151, passed 6-20-2016)
§ 11.02.070.030 SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Family transfers.
      (1)   Generally. Divisions made outside of platted subdivisions for the
purpose of a single gift or sale in each county to each member of the
landowner’s immediate family.
      (2)   Statement of intent. The intent of this exemption is to allow a
landowner to create one parcel for conveyance to each immediate family member
without local subdivision review.
      (3)   Requirements.
         (a)   This exempt division may only be made outside of any platted
subdivision.
         (b)   A single parcel may be conveyed to each immediate family member
of the landowner under this exemption in each county where the landowner owns
property.
         (c)   For purposes of this exemption, IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER means a
spouse, child by blood or adoption, and parent of the grantor.
         (d)   Filing of any certificate of survey (or recording of an
instrument of conveyance) that would use this exemption to create a parcel for
conveyance to a family member, must show the name of the grantee, relationship
to the landowner, and the parcel to be conveyed under this exemption, and the
landowner’s certification of compliance.
         (e)   Any certificate of survey that would use this exemption to
create a parcel for conveyance to a family member shall be accompanied by the
instrument of conveyance, such as a deed.
      (4)   Review criteria.
         (a)   Any proposed use of a family transfer exemption to divide a
tract of record that was created through use of an exemption.
         (b)   The use of the family transfer exemption to divide a tract that
was created as part of an overall development plan with such characteristics as
common roads, utility easements, restrictive covenants, open space, or common
marketing or promotional plan.
   (B)   Agricultural exemptions.
      (1)   Generally. Divisions made outside of platted subdivisions by gift,
sale or agreement to buy and sell in which the parties to the transaction enter
a covenant running with the land and revocable only by mutual consent of the
City Council and the property owner that the divided land will be used
exclusively for agricultural purposes.
      (2)   Statement of intent. The intent of this exemption is to allow a
landowner to create a parcel without local subdivision review where the parcel
will be used only for agricultural purposes.
      (3)   Requirements.
         (a)   Agricultural purposes: for purposes of this exemption, the term
AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES means the use of land for raising crops or livestock, or
for the preservation of open space, and specifically excludes residential,
commercial, and industrial uses and structures, as well as any facilities for
commercially or industrially processing agricultural products.
         (b)   The division must be exempt from sanitation review by the MDEQ
pursuant to MCA § 76-4-125(1)(c) as a division made for purposes other than the
construction of water supply or sewage and solid waste disposal facilities.
This sanitation exemption must be properly invoked by the property owner.
         (c)   1.   The landowner must enter into a covenant running with the
land and revocable only by mutual consent of the City Council and the property
owner, heirs, successors, and assigns that the newly created agricultural
parcel will be used exclusively for agricultural purposes as defined above.
            2.   The covenant must be signed by the property owner and the City
Council, and acknowledge that any change in use of the newly created
agricultural parcel for anything other than agricultural purposes subjects the
parcel to subdivision review.
         (d)   Any change in use of the newly created agricultural parcel for
anything other than agricultural purposes subjects the parcel to subdivision
review.
         (e)   For purposes of this chapter, a tract of record becomes created
when a new tract of record becomes of record, such as when a single tract is
divided into two tracts. Boundary line relocations that start with two tracts
and result in two tracts do not create new tracts.
         (f)   The use of the agricultural exemption may not create more than
one remaining parcel of less than 160 acres.
   (C)   Relocation of common boundaries and aggregation of lots.
      (1)   Statement of intent. The intent of these exemptions is to allow a
change in the location of one or more boundary line between parcels and to
allow transfer of the land without subdivision review or to allow more than one
parcel to be aggregated into fewer parcels.
      (2)   Requirements.
         (a)   If the relocation of common boundaries would result in the
permanent creation of an additional parcel of land, the division of land must
be reviewed as a subdivision.
         (b)   If a change is made to a platted subdivision which results in a
redesign or rearrangement of six or more lots in a platted subdivision, the
division of land must be reviewed as a major subdivision.
         (c)   Certificates of survey, or amended plats for those altering
platted subdivisions, claiming one of these exemptions must clearly distinguish
between existing boundary locations and new boundary locations.
            1.   This shall be accomplished by showing the existing boundaries
with dashed lines and the new boundaries with solid lines.
            2.   The appropriate certification set forth in ARM § 24.183.1104
(1)(f) must be included on the certificate of survey or amended plat.
         (d)   When certificates of survey are filed with the County Clerk and
Recorder’s office with the purpose of relocating boundary lines or aggregation
of lots, the certificate of survey must be accompanied by deed(s) or other
conveyance document(s) to effectuate the exemption and describe the entire
newly described parcel(s) or that portion of the parcel(s) being affected.
   (D)   Exemption to provide security for a construction mortgage, lien or
trust indenture.
      (1)   Statement of intent.
         (a)   1.   Under policies by many lending institutions and federal
home loan guaranty programs, a landowner who is buying a tract with financing
or through a contract for deed is required to hold title to the specific site
on which the residence will be built.
            2.   The intended purpose of this exemption is to allow a landowner
who is buying a tract using financing or contract for deed to segregate a
smaller parcel from the tract for security for financing construction of a home
on the property.
         (b)   1.   This exemption is not available to simply create a parcel
without review by claiming that the parcel will be used for security to finance
construction of a home or other structure on the proposed lot.
            2.   This exemption may not be properly invoked unless:
               a.   The claimant is purchasing a larger tract through financing
or a contract for deed (and thus does not hold title); and
               b.   A lending institution requires the landowner to hold title
to a smaller parcel of the tract because the smaller tract is required as
security for a building construction loan.
      (2)   Requirements.
         (a)   These regulations do not require a certificate of survey or
amended plat to invoke the use of the exemption claimed under MCA § 76-3-201(1)
(b). Surveys for this exemption are at the discretion of the claimants, lending
institutions, surveyors and the like, but are encouraged to provide proper
legal descriptions in the event of default of the lien and creation of the
tract(s).
         (b)   When this exemption is to be used, the landowner shall submit
the following along with an affidavit affirming entitlement to the claimed
exemption to the Administrator:
            1.   A statement of how many parcels within the original tract
would be created by use of the exemption;
            2.   The deed, trust indenture or mortgage for the exempt parcel
(which states that the tract of land is being created only to secure a
construction mortgage, lien or trust indenture);
            3.   A statement explaining who will have title to and possession
of the balance of the original parcel after title to the exempted parcel is
conveyed;
            4.   A signed statement from a lending institution that the
creation of the exempted parcel is necessary to secure a construction loan for
buildings or other improvements on the parcel; and
            5.   Documentation that the lending institution is a financial or
lending institution registered to do business in the state.
         (c)   The use of this exemption may be for the purpose of evading the
MSPA if:
            1.   It will create more than one building site;
            2.   The financing is not for construction on the exempted parcel;
            3.   The person named in the statement explaining who would have
possession of the remainder parcel if title to the exempted parcel is conveyed
is anyone other than the borrower of funds for construction;
            4.   Title to the exempted parcel will not be initially obtained by
the lending institution if foreclosure occurs; or
            5.   It appears that the principal reason the parcel is being
created is to create a building site and using the parcel to secure a
construction loan is a secondary purpose.
   (E)   Court ordered divisions. 
      (1)   The intent of this exemption is to provide for divisions of land
created by order of any court of record in this state or by operation of law or
that, in the absence of agreement between the parties to the sale, could be
created by an order of any court in this state pursuant to the law of eminent
domain, MCA Title 70, Section 30.
      (2)   Pursuant to MCA § 76-3-201(3) before a court of record orders a
division of land, the court shall notify the City Council of the pending
division and allow the city to present written comments on the division.
   (F)   Condominiums, townhomes or townhouses.
      (1)   Statement of intent. Generally, condominiums, townhomes or
townhouses, as those terms are defined in MCA § 70-23-102, are subject to
review as subdivisions as described in the MSPA, but under certain
circumstances, they may be exempt from review pursuant to MCA § 76-3-203.
      (2)   Exemption. Condominiums, townhomes or townhouses, as those terms
are defined in MCA § 70-23-102, are exempt from subdivision review if:
         (a)   They are constructed on lots subdivided in compliance with these
regulations and the approval of the original subdivision of land expressly
contemplated the construction of the condominiums, townhomes or townhouses and
any applicable park dedication requirements in MCA § 76-3-621 and
§ 11.02.060.240 are complied with; or
         (b)   The condominium, townhome or townhouse proposal is in
conformance with applicable local zoning regulations when local zoning
regulations are in effect.
      (3)   Requirements.
         (a)   To use the exemption, the declaration of unit ownership must
include an exhibit containing certification from the city that the condominiums
are exempt from review under MCA § 76-3-203 (see MCA § 70-23-301).

PLAN FOR ANNEXATION
§ 11.03.010.010 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The city hereby recognizes that state law has established municipal
governments for the purpose of providing local government services essential
for sound urban development of communities, as well as for the protection of
health, safety and welfare in areas, either already being intensively used or
undergoing development for residential, commercial, industrial, institutional
and governmental purposes.
   (B)   Per the state’s annexation laws, an evaluation, November 1980, the
Montana Legislative Council, “historically, the purpose of Montana’s annexation
statutes have been simply to provide expanding communities with:
      (1)   A united and effective single form of government;
      (2)   Orderly growth through uniform regulations such as building codes,
planning and zoning standards; and
      (3)   An equal sharing of community resources and financial
responsibility for those resources by people living in an area united by
social, political, and economic interests.”
(Prior Code, § 11.03.010.010) (Res. 150, passed 6-18-2016; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.03.010.020 LONG RANGE PLAN.
   (A)   As required by MCA § 7-2-4732, this annexation plan anticipates
development for a period of at least ten years into the future. The U.S. Census
Bureau 2010 Decennial Census lists the population of the city at 3,111. The
city growth policy update 2015 noted a historic growth rate of negative 0.69%
annually. Recent preliminary engineering reports for water and wastewater
systems estimate a population in 2025 of 3,365, a positive annual growth rate
of 0.7%.
   (B)   In addition to considering the impacts and additional needs created by
individual growth and development projects on a case-by-case basis, plans and
studies for the following facilities and services will be consulted when
annexation is considered.
      (1)   The city growth policy update, 2015. While the population
projections in the city growth policy update are based on historic averages,
the growth policy calls for the city to be prepared for a slow shift towards an
increasing population. In the meantime, the document calls for the need to
annex in order to accommodate new business opportunities and allow for
subdivisions that will market newer housing options. The growth policy
establishes policies and general land use patterns desired in newly annexed
areas.
      (2)   The city zoning regulations. This document, which may be updated
from time to time, establishes the type and intensity of development that can
occur in newly annexed areas based on the guidance in the growth policy.
      (3)   Sewer. The city operates a wastewater collection and treatment
system that provides capacity within the city boundary and on a limited basis
outside the city boundary. The city’s wastewater treatment system has been
operating below state and federal standards. In addition, the system is near
the end of its lifespan. The city is in the process of upgrades to the
treatment system. When the upgrades are complete, the city intends to operate
and maintain sewer facilities in accordance with state and federal standards.
The existing system is over designed for the population of the community. The
system that is being constructed will reduce the size of the facility to
accommodate a population of 4,500. The city also plans to study and upgrade the
collection system which is prone to infiltration.
      (4)   Water. The city operates a municipal water supply and distribution
system that provides capacity within the city boundary and on a limited basis
outside the city boundary. The system is capable of meeting the design maximum
day demand of 1,223 GPM in year 2033. The current system suffers from excessive
leakage. The city plans to continue to identify leaks and improve the delivery
system to reduce leakage. The city also plans to develop a new water source to
replace a well that is out of service due to quality issues. The city intends
to operate and maintain water facilities in accordance with state and federal
standards.
      (5)   Streets and sidewalks. The city maintains streets and sidewalks
within the city boundary. The city does not have plans for the extension of
streets and sidewalks outside of its boundaries. The extension of streets and
sidewalks will be made on an individual basis.
      (6)   Parks and trails. The city growth policy identifies areas for trail
expansions and for future parks. The city will continue to explore options for
trails and parks development.
      (7)   Storm drainage. The city maintains a small disconnected storm sewer
system. There are no plans for the extension of this system. Storm drainage in
areas to be annexed will be considered on an individual basis.
      (8)   Street lighting. Street lighting is provided in the city through
lighting districts. No plans have been created to expand the districts.
Instead, when new development occurs, lighting districts will be expanded or
developed to fund the maintenance of new streetlights.
      (9)   Public safety. The city provides police and fire protection. In the
area immediately outside the city limits in the county, the city provides fire
services to a rural fire district through an interlocal agreement. At this
time, there are no specific plans for expansion. Instead, additional equipment
and personnel will be added as needed over time in accordance with city
policies in effect at the time of development.
      (10)   Solid waste collection. Solid waste is collected by the City Solid
Waste Department. Additional equipment and personnel will be added as needed
over time in accordance with city policies in effect at the time of
development.
      (11)   Capital improvements plan. The city has adopted a capital
improvements plan which identifies a schedule and financing options for capital
projects and equipment purchases. The capital improvements plan will be updated
in 2016.
(Prior Code, § 11.03.010.020) (Res. 150, passed 6-18-2016; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.03.010.030 GENERAL ANNEXATION POLICES.
   (A)   The following are general policies the city plans to use to guide
annexation.
      (1)   (a)   The city may seek to utilize any and all methods for
annexation authorized under state law (MCA Title 7, Chapter 2). All annexation
proceedings will follow the requirements of state law in every respect.
         (b)   The city will consider, in a timely manner, any property owner’s
petition requesting annexation of land that is eligible for annexation in
accordance with state statutes.
      (2)   All municipal services will be available to property that is
annexed within a reasonable time (generally not to exceed five years) on
substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are
available to the rest of the municipality. All municipal services should be
available when development occurs and demand for sewer, water, streets and
other services begins. If it is likely that the area proposed to be annexed
will not have municipal services available when development occurs, the area
should not be annexed.
      (3)   Properties outside of the city municipal boundary will not be
connected to or receive service from the city’s water and/or sewer systems
without either annexation or the property owner submitting a waiver of the
right to protest annexation as a requirement for receiving service.
      (4)   For those properties currently receiving water and/or sewer service
that are not within the city limits, the city may require the property owner(s)
to consent to annexation or waive the right to protest annexation as a
condition of continued water and/or sewer service.
      (5)   The city has no plans to extend services to specific annexation
areas at this time. The city cannot predict the exact future extensions and
requirements for new services because new mains and streets and the need for
other services are typically initiated by private parties based on the market
for new development, and the exact specifications needed for such facilities
and services will be determined when development takes place.
      (6)   The city does not plan to extend services and add new areas to the
community each and every year, but instead when expansion is in the best
interest of the citizens of city in accordance with the policies in effect when
annexation and development are proposed.
      (7)   In addition to the use of special improvement districts, and
payback or recapture agreements (divisions (F) and (G) below) and in accordance
with MCA § 76-3-510, the developer(s) or property owner(s) of annexed property
will generally be required to extend all infrastructure improvements,
including, but not limited to, water lines, sewer lines, fire hydrants,
reservoirs, pump stations, lift stations, culverts, storm drainage systems,
streets, sidewalks, parks and trails, street lighting, traffic-control devices,
street name signs, and such other improvements, as may be required by the city,
at the developer’s or property owner’s expense.
         (a)   The infrastructure improvements will be constructed in
accordance with the city subdivision regulations, the most recent edition of
the Montana Public Works Standard Specifications, and Montana Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) requirements.
         (b)   The infrastructure improvements shall be in compliance with
applicable codes and standards, and be of adequate size and design to
accommodate the needs of the proposed development.
         (c)   All proposed infrastructure shall be reviewed and approved by
the City Public Works Director, and as-built drawings as required by the City
Public Works Director shall be submitted to the city prior to final acceptance
of the infrastructure.
         (d)   All infrastructure necessary to serve newly annexed areas shall
be in place concurrently with occupancy of the areas.
      (8)   The developer(s) or property owner(s) shall be responsible for
providing fire protection appurtenances and required water flow pressures and
volume, at the developer’s or property owner’s expense, as required by the
applicable Fire Code enforced by the city and reviewed and approved by the City
Fire Chief and the State Fire Marshal, based on the use of land and the type of
construction employed.
      (9)   Municipal services of police, fire, garbage collection, and streets
and street maintenance services, street lighting, parks and recreation
facilities, and all general administrative services shall be provided to
annexed property on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as
provided to the rest of the municipality.
      (10)   Once newly developed facilities have been installed and areas
annexed, the entire municipality will tend to share the tax burden for these
facilities and services, and if so, no new city-wide bond issue is planned for
the sole purpose of financing provision of municipal services to annexed areas.
      (11)   Properties proposed for development in areas which do not have
immediate access to city water and/or sewer, but where services are in close
proximity, may be required to install dry water and sewer lines in anticipation
of the extension of city water and sewer into the area within a reasonable
time, generally not to exceed five years. Once adequate water and sewer
facilities are within 200 feet of the site, or if a new subdivision lot is
within 500 feet of city water and sewer, connection may be required at the
property owner’s or developer’s expense.
      (12)   As new city streets and sidewalks are constructed, and as existing
streets are improved, storm drainage infrastructure shall be installed or
improved to city site design, DEQ and Environmental Protection Agency
standards.
         (a)   It is the responsibility of the developer(s) or property owner
(s) to convey stormwater from their property to an appropriate point of
disposal as approved by the Public Works Director.
         (b)   If there is no storm sewer conveyance system available to the
site, stormwater generated as a result of the development shall be retained on
site in accordance with applicable DEQ requirements.
      (13)   The developer(s) or property owner(s) shall provide all necessary
right-of-way and/or easements, or additional right-of-way or easements if less
than adequate right-of-way or easements exist in property proposed for
annexation.
      (14)   The city has adequate water supply and sewer treatment and
disposal facilities, funded by existing taxpayers and rate payers, to support
existing development and, where city capacity is not sufficient for new
development, the city intends to increase capacity as soon as possible.
      (15)   All property owners located in a newly annexed area will be
required to comply with all city, state, and federal laws, statutes,
regulations, ordinances, and resolutions, including but not limited to, zoning,
building codes, fire prevention ordinance and fire codes, fireworks ordinances,
dog license ordinance, business license ordinance, and all other laws,
statutes, regulations, ordinances, and resolutions.
   (B)   Policies for providing services in existing developed areas.
      (1)   (a)   Property that is proposed for annexation and has existing
infrastructure shall generally be required to upgrade the infrastructure to
city standards as a condition of annexation.
         (b)   However, the city may choose to participate in upgrades to
existing infrastructure, may waive upgrade requirements, or may allow phased
improvements in certain instances based on the policies provided in this plan
and additional, location-specific factors.
      (2)   Prior to annexation, the city may require the developer(s) or
property owner(s) to provide the City Council with a report describing the
following:
         (a)   The approximate year or period in which the existing area was
developed;
         (b)   The location, size and condition of the existing infrastructure,
including, but not limited to, water and sewer lines, fire hydrants, and
streets and storm drainage;
         (c)   The size and location and legal purpose of all existing right-
of-ways and easements;
         (d)   1.   The report shall also include the estimated costs
associated with correcting the deficiencies and bringing the utility or
improvement to city standards.
            2.   The city may require such a report to be prepared by a
professional engineer at the cost of the developer(s) or property owner(s).
   (C)   (1)   In certain instances, it may be appropriate to require areas
within the city limits, including recently annexed areas, to connect to city
services which are available over a stated period of time generally not to
exceed five years.
      (2)   This would provide the opportunity to phase out individual and
private systems utilizing on-site facilities or other antiquated systems, which
operate at a marginal level and which may not be compatible with city
standards.
(Prior Code, § 11.03.010.030) (Res. 150, passed 6-18-2016; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
EXTENSION OF SERVICES
§ 11.03.020.010 OFF-SITE INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   In the event that annexation necessitates off-site infrastructure
improvements, the developer(s) or property owner(s) of the property proposed
for annexation will be responsible for bearing the initial costs of such
improvements, unless otherwise determined by the City Council.
   (B)   The city may require reimbursement from a developer(s) or property
owner(s) for city financed infrastructure that was installed in anticipation of
future development on property that is proposed for annexation. Reimbursement
costs shall be proportional to the additional capacity and facilities made
necessary or used by the new development.
      (1)   It shall be the responsibility of the developer(s) or property
owner(s) to extend all roadways and utilities from the existing city facilities
to the site of development in accordance with all city standards and
specifications, including the provision for appropriate easements.
      (2)   It shall further be the responsibility of the developer(s) or
property owner(s) to construct all streets and utilities to the furthest
boundary of the property to be developed or annexed when it is deemed
appropriate by the City Council or Public Works Director in order to facilitate
future development.
(Prior Code, § 11.03.020.010) (Res. 150, passed 6-18-2016; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.03.020.020 SPECIAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The City Council, in its discretion, may approve the formation of a
Special Improvement District to pay for the installation, construction and
upgrading of infrastructure improvements.
   (B)   The boundaries of the Special Improvement District shall be the area
benefiting from the improvements in accordance with the laws of the state.
(Prior Code, § 11.03.020.020) (Res. 150, passed 6-18-2016; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.03.020.030 PAYBACK OR RECAPTURE AGREEMENT.
   If a developer(s) or property owner(s) of property annexed pays the entire
cost of infrastructure improvements, and such improvements will benefit other
property that may be developed or annexed in the future, the City Council may,
in its discretion, authorize a payback or recapture agreement.
   (A)   The agreement may provide that developer(s) or property owner(s) that
connect to the infrastructure improvements in the future shall reimburse the
developer(s) or property owner(s) that initially paid for the improvement a
portion of the cost of the improvement.
   (B)   The agreement shall include a method of calculating the amount of
reimbursement.
   (C)   The method of reimbursement may be based upon lot size, front footage,
or other means that the City Council deems reasonable.
   (D)   The payback period shall not exceed ten years from the date of
completion of construction or installation of the improvement.
   (E)   The agreement shall set forth the specific area that may benefit from
the improvement and that will be subject to the agreement.
   (F)   In addition to capital improvements, the costs that may be reimbursed
under an agreement may include engineering, design and inspection fees.
   (G)   Any and all terms and conditions of an agreement are subject to
approval by the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 11.03.020.030) (Res. 150, passed 6-18-2016; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
PETITION FOR ANNEXATION
§ 11.03.030.010 PETITION FOR ANNEXATION.
   (A)   If a property owner(s) petitions the city to have property annexed
pursuant to MCA Title 7, Chapter 2, Part 46, the property owner(s) shall submit
a petition(s) for annexation in a form provided at city hall.
   (B)   The petitioner(s) shall also provide the city with the following:
      (1)   A map depicting all of the tracts of land proposed for annexation;
      (2)   A notarized list with the legal description, and the names and
mailing addresses of the owner(s) of each tract of land in the area proposed
for annexation from the records of the County Clerk and Recorder or a licensed
title company; and
      (3)   Concurrent with a petition for annexation, the petitioner shall
also propose one or more zoning designations in accordance with the land use
designation in the city growth policy for the property to be annexed, and a
site plan or preliminary plat indicating the sizes of lots, proposed land uses
and density of development anticipated for the property.
(Prior Code, § 11.03.030.010) (Res. 150, passed 6-18-2016; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021) ANNEXATION AREAS
§ 11.03.040.010 AREAS CONSIDERED FOR ANNEXATION.
   (A)   Generally. Currently, there are several areas adjacent to and near the
perimeter of the city that are natural extensions of the city, but which are
not presently located within the corporate boundaries.
      (1)   Some of these areas are already extensively developed and are
deriving benefits from the city without paying their just and equal share for
municipal services.
      (2)   Other areas are not extensively developed, but given the projected
demand for residential, commercial and industrial development, certain areas
will be attractive for development in the future.
   (B)   Potential areas. As part of this plan, potential annexation areas were
created so that the city could evaluate where annexation might naturally occur
within the next five to ten years, and where the city might want to encourage
or even pursue annexation and development. The map titled annexation areas
illustrates the four areas adjacent to the city that are identified as
potential areas with attributes that lend them to consideration for annexation,
either partially or completely, depending on conditions at the time of proposed
annexation and development. These areas total ±501 acres (±0.78 square miles).
The attributes considered during creation of this plan include, but are not
limited to:
      (1)   Proximity to the current city limits and developed areas of the
community;
      (2)   The city 2015 growth policy land use designations;
      (3)   The city 2015 growth policy services extension area;

residential, 53 acres of high density residential, 60 acres of low density
residential, and four acres of public.
      (2)   (a)   The north side annexation areas is a mix of developed and
undeveloped parcels. Generally, the area is desirable for extension of services
to existing residential development and undeveloped platted lots, extension of
services to existing commercial development, new residential development and
new commercial development.
         (b)   The city owns land identified in the 2015 city growth policy as
a potential city park that may also be desirable for annexation.
   (D)   West side annexation area.
      (1)   (a)   The west side annexation area is a continuous area of 223
acres west of the city.
         (b)   The area is adjacent to the Deer Lodge - Powell County Airport.
The land use designations include 111 acres of industrial, 40 acres of high
density residential and 73 acres of low density residential.
      (2)   The west side annexation area is primarily undeveloped, however
some existing development exists adjacent to the city boundary.
         (a)   Generally, the area is desirable for extension of services to
existing residential development, new residential development and new
industrial development.
         (b)   A portion of the area with a land use designation of industrial
is a potential site of an industrial park.
   (E)   South side annexation area.
      (1)   (a)   The south side annexation area is a continuous area of 97
acres south of the city between I-90 to the east and Valley View Drive to the
west.
         (b)   The land use designations include 25 acres of high density
residential and 71 acres of low density residential.
      (2)   (a)   The south side annexation area is primarily comprised of
existing development of large lot residential parcels.
         (b)   Generally, the area is desirable for extension of services to
existing residential development.
   (F)   East side annexation area.
      (1)   The east side annexation area is a small sliver of land on the east
side of the city between the city limits and I-90.
         (a)   The land use designation is agricultural.
         (b)   The area is about five acres.
      (2)   The east side annexation area is primarily comprised of existing
development of residential parcels.
         (a)   Some of these parcels have water and sewer services.
         (b)   Annexation may be desirable to bring the parcels enjoying city
services into the city.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 11.05.010.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these engineering and design standards and construction
standards is to promote maximum uniformity to engineering design and
construction practices that will provide the city with complete, quality
construction drawings and specifications. In turn, it is expected public
infrastructure construction will have uniformity in materials and workmanship
that will provide the city infrastructure that lasts well beyond its expected
design life and does not require additional maintenance outside the standard
maintenance associated with various components of infrastructure.
(Prior Code, § 11.05.010.010) (Ord. 2019-9, passed 9-3-2019; Ord. 2021-15,
passed 12-20-2021)
§ 11.05.010.020 ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS.
   It is the policy of the city and Public Works Department (PWD), that in most
cases, adherence to these adopted standards will not create undue hardship or
not be in the public’s best interest.
   (A)   However, when unique circumstances make adherence to these standards
impractical, or would create a condition detrimental to the public interest,
the PWD will consider alternate solutions.
   (B)   Any alternate solutions must follow sound engineering and/or
construction practices.
   (C)   The City Council will consider deviation requests from these
standards, after review and recommendation from the Public Works Committee.

§ 11.05.010.030 ADOPTION OF MONTANA PUBLIC WORKS STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS.
   The city adopts the current edition of the Montana Public Works Standard
Specifications (MPWSS).
   (A)   Modifications to the MPWSS are set forth in this document.
   (B)   These changes and/or additions shall in all cases either govern over

   (A)   This section outlines the requirements for sizing flow control
facilities. The flow control standards are based on the Stormwater Management
Manual for Eastern Washington and the Spokane County Stormwater Manual.
      (1)   Standard flow control facilities are detention, retention (natural
depressions) and infiltration facility.
      (2)   Any other facility is considered a non-standard system and shall be
evaluated individually by the City PWD.
      (3)   Flow control facilities are necessary to mitigate potential adverse
impacts on down-gradient properties due to the increase in stormwater run-off
caused by land development.
   (B)   (1)   The peak rate of stormwater run-off from any proposed land
development to any natural or constructed point of discharge downstream shall
not exceed the pre-development peak rate of run-off.
      (2)   The post development volume of run-off can exceed the pre-
development volume of run-off when the required down-gradient analysis
demonstrates that there will be no adverse impacts on down gradient properties
or existing natural and constructed conveyance systems.
(Prior Code, § 11.05.040.060) (Ord. 2019-9, passed 9-3-2019; Ord. 2021-15,
passed 12-20-2021)
§ 11.05.040.070 DETENTION FACILITIES MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Facility volume.
      (1)   The CN method requires the selection of, or the input of, a
rainfall distribution and the precipitation associated with a design storm.
      (2)   The NRCS Type I 24-hour ten- and 100-year storm events are the
design storms to be used for all flow control facilities that use a surface
discharge.
      (3)   Detention ponds shall be sized using one of the following methods:
         (a)   Sized to contain the difference between the post development and
the pre-development 24-hour storm events; or
         (b)   Post development level pool routing method with a draw down time
of 72 hours.
   (B)   Setbacks. When a detention facility is proposed upslope of developed
property or at the top of a slope inclined 15 % or greater, the minimum setback
from the slope must be greater than or equal to 50 feet or as determined by a
licensed engineer with geotechnical experience.
   (C)   Release point.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Stormwater run-off from a developed site shall leave the site in
the same manner and location as it did in the pre-developed condition.
         (b)   The distance between the outlet structure and the inlet into the
detention facility shall be maximized.
      (2)   Outflow control structures.
         (a)   Control structures are manhole or catch basins with a restrictor
device used for controlling outflow from a facility to meet a desired standard.
            1.   Outflow structures are required for all stormwater detention
facilities.
            2.   The restrictor device is usually multiple orifices, consisting
of two or more orifices and/or a weir section sized to meet performance
requirements.
         (b)   1.   Run-off shall enter the detention facility through a
conveyance system separate from the control and outflow conveyance system.
            2.   The distance between the inlet and outlet shall be maximized
to reduce sediment from accumulating in the outflow structure. The types of
outflow control structures are listed below.
               a.   Multiple orifice restrictors.
                  i.   In most cases, control structure need only two orifices:
one at the bottom and one near the tip of the riser;
                  ii.   Minimum orifice diameter is three inches; and
                  iii.   Orifice shall be constructed on a tee section or on a
baffle.
               b.   Risers and weir restrictor.
                  i.   Properly designed weirs maybe used as flow restrictors.
However, they must be designed to provide for primary overflow of the developed
100-year peak flow discharging to the detention facility; and
                  ii.   The combined orifice and riser (or weir) overflow may
be used to meet flow requirements. However, the design must still provide for
primary overflow of the developed 100-year peak assuming all orifices are
plugged.
               c.   Outflow control structure minimum requirements. The
following minimum access requirements shall be met. Additional requirements are
specified in Appendix A.
                  i.   An access road to the control structure is required for
inspection and maintenance; and
                  ii.   Manhole and catch basin lids for control structure
shall be locking and rim elevation shall match proposed finish grade.

STREETS AND TRANSPORTATION
§ 11.05.050.010 OVERVIEW.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this section to establish minimum standards
for public and private transportation facilities for vehicles, public transit,
pedestrians and bicycles, hereafter constructed or improved as a condition of
city approval of a development, or a transportation project constructed by the
city. These standards are intended to implement city’s growth policy and to
minimize total costs over the life of the transportation system.
      (2)   Implementing these standards requires balancing of several policy
concerns, including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Providing a safe and efficient transportation system;
         (b)   Implementing the complete streets policy;
         (c)   Discouraging excessive speed; and
         (d)   Requiring no more right-of-way than necessary.
   (B)   Definitions. Words and phrases in these standards have the same
general meaning as those contained in the city subdivision regulations, the
zoning ordinance of the city and the MPWSS. If terms are conflicting or
unclear, the PWD will clarify the meaning and intent.
   (C)   Functional classifications; purpose. The purpose of a functional
classification system for city roads is to define varying levels and types of
transportation infrastructure, and to provide for the safe and efficient
movement of people and goods, while at the same time preserving residential
areas and maintaining the economic vitality of commercial and industrial areas.
The system classifies transportation facilities as either urban or rural roads.
Within urban roads, they are further divided into arterials, collectors or
local roads.
   (D)   Functional classifications; urban roads. Urban roads are classified as
outlined below.
      (1)   Major arterial. The basic element of the city’s road system. All
other functional classifications supplement the major arterial network. Access
to a major arterial is generally limited to intersections with other major
arterials or to the interstate system. Direct access is minimal and controlled.
The purpose of a major arterial is to serve the major centers of activity, the
highest traffic volume corridors and the longest trip distances in an urbanized
area. This classification of roads carries a high proportion of the total
traffic within an urban area. The intended function is to provide for the
expedient movement of traffic. Posted speed limits on major arterials typically
range from 35 mph to 70 mph and typically carry greater than 15,000 vehicles
per day.
      (2)   Minor arterial. Interconnects with and augments the major arterial
system. It also provides access to lower classifications of roads on the system
and may allow for traffic to directly access destinations. They provide for
movement within sub-areas of the city, whose boundaries are largely defined by
the major arterial road system. They serve through traffic, while at the same
time provide direct access for commercial, industrial, office and multi-family
development but, generally, not for single-family residential properties. The
purpose of this classification of road is to increase traffic mobility by
connecting to both the major arterial system and also providing access to
adjacent land uses. Posted speed limits on minor arterials typically range from
25 mph to 55 mph and can carry between 5,000 and 15,000 vehicles per day.
      (3)   Major collector. Provides for land access and traffic circulation
within and between residential neighborhoods, and commercial and industrial
areas. It provides for the equal priority of the movement of traffic, coupled
with access to residential, business and industrial areas. A collector roadway
may at times traverse residential neighborhoods. Posted speed limits on
collectors typically range from 25 mph to 45 mph and can carry between 3,500
and 5,000 vehicles per day.
      (4)   Minor collector. Provides for land access and traffic circulation
within and between residential neighborhoods, and commercial and industrial
areas. Future growth of the city outside the subdivision will have limited use
of the roadway. It provides for the equal priority of the movement of traffic,
coupled with access to residential, business and industrial areas. Posted speed
limits on collectors typically range from 25 mph to 45 mph and can carry
between 1,500 and 3,500 vehicles per day.
      (5)   Local. Comprises all facilities not included in the higher systems.
Its primary purpose is to permit direct access to abutting lands and
connections to higher systems. Usually through-traffic movements are
intentionally discouraged. Posted speed limits on local roads typically range
from 20 mph to 30 mph and designed for less than 1,500 vehicles per day.
(Prior Code, § 11.05.050.010) (Ord. 2019-9, passed 9-3-2019; Ord. 2021-15,
passed 12-20-2021)
§ 11.05.050.020 TRANSPORTATION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Roadway design and technical criteria. This section sets forth the
minimum design and technical criteria to be used in the preparation of all
roadway plans. All roadway plans should be designed in conformance with these
standards, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), being 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101
et seq.
   (B)   Typical section. Street typical sections and right-of-way will be
provided as shown on the standard drawings for local road, minor collector and
major collector. The typical section for arterial streets will be designed
based on site specific information and parameters associated with the corridor.
At a minimum, minor arterial typical sections will include 11-foot driving
lanes, eight-foot boulevards and six-foot sidewalks. At a minimum, major
arterial typical sections will include 12-foot driving lanes, ten-foot
boulevards and six-foot sidewalks. All sidewalks will be concrete.
   (C)   Drive approach standards; curb cut requirements. Driveways along
public and private roadways shall comply with city standard drawing. The
purpose of these standards and requirements is to regulate and control the
location, size, type, construction, maintenance and quantity of curb cuts,
driveway aprons and sidewalk driveway crossings in the city from the standpoint
of proper design, safe and efficient entry to and exit from city streets to
private property, safety of vehicular traffic in the streets, and safety of
pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk area.
   (D)   Horizontal alignment. Good engineering design uses minimum and maximum
design criteria only when site constraints prohibit otherwise.
      (1)   Turning radius. All roadways shall intersect at right angles as
nearly as possible, with no roadways intersecting at an angle less than 75°.
      (2)   Curb return radius. Minimum curb returns shall be as shown in Table
5-1. Larger radii may be permitted based on land use and engineering analysis.
      (3)   Design speed. Design speed shall be as shown in Table 5.2. The
design speed is typically higher than or equal to the posted speed limit. The
design speed determines various geometric design features of roadways.
      (4)   Horizontal curves. The minimum centerline radius for horizontal
curves shall be as shown in Table 5.2.

      (5)   Meeting streets. Two streets meeting a third street from opposite
sides shall meet at the same point, or their centerlines shall be off-set at
least 125 feet.
      (6)   Super elevation. Super elevation may be required for collector and
arterial streets based upon design speed and horizontal geometry. Super
elevation shall be in accordance with the recommendations of AASHTO or other
engineering guideline widely accepted by the engineering community.
      (7)   Spiral curves. Spiral curves shall not be used on roadways within
the city (state highways excluded).
      (8)   Barricades. Wherever roadways terminate due to project phasing,
subdivision boundaries and the like barricades are required in accordance with
the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

**   All design criteria per AASHTO standards
(1)   Per AASHTO based on design speed
 
   (E)   Vertical alignment. Good engineering practice does not utilize minimum
and maximum design criteria unless site constraints dictate otherwise.
      (1)   Changing grades. Continuous grade changes or “roller-coastering” is
not desirable in most cases and will not be allowed, unless justified site
conditions and sound engineering judgement. The limitation of grade breaks in
lieu of vertical curves is identified in Table 5-2.
      (2)   Vertical curves. All vertical curves shall be symmetrical. Design
criteria for vertical curves are found in Table 5-2.
      (3)   Intersections. The following additional criteria shall apply at
intersections.
         (a)   The grade of the “through” street shall take precedence at
intersections. At intersections of roadways with the same classifications, the
more important roadway, as determined by the PWD, shall have this precedence.
Side streets shall be warped to match through streets within maximum grade
identified in Table 5-2.
         (b)   The elevation at the point of tangency (PT) of the curb return
on the through street is always set by the grade of the through street in
conjunction with normal pavement cross slope. Carrying the crown of the side
street into the intersecting through street is not permitted. At an arterial-
arterial intersection, a more detailed review on the entire intersection’s
grades and geometrics shall be performed by the designer and submitted for
review and approval.
      (4)   Curb and gutter. Minimum grade for all curb and gutter is 0.4%.
      (5)   Connection with existing roadways. Connections with existing
roadways shall be smooth transitions conforming to normal vertical curve
criteria if the algebraic difference in grade (A) between the existing and
proposed grade exceeds the difference identified in Table 5-2. When a vertical
curve is used to make this transition, it shall be fully accomplished prior to
the connection with the existing improvement. Field-verified slope and
elevation of existing roadways shall be shown on the plans.
   (F)   Roadway drainage.
      (1)   Generally. Drainage systems shall be designed in accordance with §
§ 11.06.040.010 through 11.06.040.070. Development plans, including a drainage
report, for the drainage system are required for concurrent review with, and
shall be considered a part thereof, of the roadway design.
      (2)   Inlets. Inlets shall be located to intercept the major curb flow at
the point curb flow capacity is exceeded by the storm run-off. Inlets should be
aligned with lot lines wherever possible. Inlets shall also be installed to
intercept cross-pavement flows at points of transition in super elevation. Due
to the presence of pedestrian ramps, inlets are not allowed in the curb return,
but will be located at the tangent points of the curb return.
      (3)   Cross slope. Except at intersections, or where super-elevation is
required, roadways shall be level from top of curb to top of curb and shall
have a crown cross-slope as identified in Table 5-2. Parabolic or curve crowns
are not allowed. Maximum pavement cross slope allowed is 5% at intersection
transitions. In no case shall the pavement cross slope at warped intersections
exceed the grade of the through street. When warping side streets at
intersections, the crown transition should be completed within 75 feet
horizontally for local streets, 100 feet horizontally for collector streets and
150 feet horizontally for arterial streets.
   (G)   Roadway specifications.
      (1)   Pavement thickness. Pavement thickness design must be completed for
all new or reconstructed roadways and shall be based on the current AASHTO
Guide for Design of Pavement Structures, or the current Asphalt Institute
Manual Series No. 1 (MS-1) for thickness design. The pavement design report,
based upon specific site soil data and design year traffic loading conditions,
shall be prepared by a professional engineer and submitted to the PWD, along
with the plans and specifications for the project. The design shall be based on
at least a 20-year performance period traffic volume; however, the minimum
design lane 18,000-pound equivalent single axle load (ESAL) used in the
pavement design shall not be less than 50,000-pound ESAL. The minimum asphalt
pavement thickness for any new street or roadway shall be three inches and
minimum of eight inches of crushed base course will be provided.
      (2)   Utility trenches. Utility trenches, which include water and sewer
services, cut through asphalt newer than ten years shall be saw cut the entire
width of the street and backfilled with flowable fill material, complying with
the requirements of flowable fill contained in the MPWSS. The intent is to
protect the integrity of the roadway riding surface and eliminate the potential
for roadway failure due to failure of trench backfill material under a roadway.
      (3)   Application. Prior to any street opening, an application with a
traffic-control plan shall be submitted to the City PWD for review and
approval. All street openings shall be for a maximum of 24 hours, unless there
is written approval from the PWD. On collector or higher classified streets,
the street opening will be limited to 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. If a multi-day
closure is required, the trench shall be covered and protected to provide
vehicular traffic. All street patches will provide a minimum eight inches of
crushed base course and three inches of asphalt concrete pavement. Match
existing CBC and ACP depths if greater than the minimum.
      (4)   Temporary patches. For temporary patches, when hot mix asphalt is
not available, shall be a minimum of six inches of compacted road mix. Cold mix
asphalt can be used on a case-by-case basis as approved by the PWD. All
temporary patches shall be replaced with hot mix asphalt as soon as hot mix
asphalt pavement is available but no later than June 1.
      (5)   Tunneling. No tunneling under sidewalks, curb and gutter will be
allowed. If the excavation extends under the curb, gutter and sidewalk, the
curb, gutter or sidewalk shall be removed at the closest joint past the extent
of the trench.
      (6)   Utility trenches. All utility trenches, including the curb, gutter
and sidewalk, shall be warranted by the person or contractor requesting the
street opening for two years after acceptance by the Public Works Department of
the completed restoration to all portions of the right-of-way disturbed by the
opening, including the road surface, curb and gutter, and sidewalk, and the
proper disposal of all waste material.
   (H)   Monumentation. Monuments in monument boxes shall be provided in new or
reconstructed streets at all section corners, quarter corners, and sixteenth
corners.
   (I)   Traffic calming. TRAFFIC CALMING is defined as a combination of mainly
physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle use, alter
driver behavior and improve conditions for non-motorized street users. In
simple terms, traffic calming techniques are typically aimed at maintaining 85%
percentile vehicle speed at or below the posted speed limit. If applied
properly, these techniques result in a safe and pleasant environment for
pedestrians and bicyclists. Traffic calming applied to roadway designs for new
development should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and if utilized, should
be appropriate for the intended function of each street or street segment.
Streets designed to function as part of the major street system should be
designed primarily to move traffic in an efficient, convenient and safe manner.
Local streets and residential collectors should be designed to provide access
to properties while discouraging through-traffic and higher travel speeds that
often accompany it. New street designs and developments should consider traffic
calming strategies to reinforce the appropriate functions of the designed
streets. These would include layout and connectivity of street systems and
pedestrian/bicycle facilities, intersection treatments, and basic design
standards for width, curvature, parking, and landscaping.
   (J)   Utility corridors within new subdivisions or undeveloped annexations.
      (1)   All new utility installations within the public right-of-way
requires written approval from the PWD prior to installation, so as to assure
that the new utilities do not incommode or endanger the public in the use of
the street in accordance with MCA § 69-4-101.
      (2)   All new utilities shall be placed underground except where
underground installation is not feasible as defined in MCA § 69-4-102(2).
Transformers and junction boxes may be installed above ground in locations
approved by the PWD. All new underground utilities installed parallel to city-
owned utilities within the public street right-of-way shall be located
horizontally at least five feet away from the city-owned utilities. If five
feet cannot be maintained, the utility must submit a deviation request to the
PWD.
      (3)   Utilities shall not be installed in street boulevards, except above
ground features, such as light poles, residential transformers, and secondary
pedestals, along with the associated wiring for these features, may be allowed
providing that the placement of these features will not interfere with the
planting, growth and care of boulevard trees or impede traffic sight distance.
Perpendicular crossings of the boulevard may be allowed if placed in such a
manner not to prohibit the planting of boulevard. All utilities that are less
the four and one-half feet in depth are encouraged to be installed in
protective conduit, whenever possible. The protective conduit will allow for
the maintenance and replacement of the utility without damaging any boulevard
trees. All utilities shall be installed at the required depth relative to the
finished grade of the finished surface.
      (4)   As part of any subdivision or development involving the extension
of city utilities, the developer shall provide engineered plans for all
utilities, including gas, power, phone, fiber and the like on the
infrastructure plans for review and approval. All applicable laws, rules and
regulations of appropriate regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such
facilities shall be observed.
   (K)   Traffic impact studies.
      (1)   Private or public developments which contribute 200 or more vehicle
trips per day to the city street system shall have a traffic impact study
completed by an engineer with adequate experience and expertise in
transportation engineering. Such study shall indicate the expected increase in
traffic movements on the existing roadways serving the development and shall
determine existing conditions on roadways to be impacted by the development.
      (2)   The traffic impact study should present an objective technical
analysis in a straightforward and logical manner that leads the reviewer
through the analytical process to the resulting conclusions and
recommendations. Sufficient detail should be provided so that the reviewer is
able to follow the path and methodology of the study. All assumptions should be
clearly documented with published sources referenced as necessary. All traffic
impact studies shall be signed and stamped by a licensed professional engineer
registered in the state.
      (3)   At a minimum, the traffic impact study should include the following
information.
         (a)   Introduction. Provide an introduction with an overview and
discussion of the development proposal. Include a vicinity map detailing the
property location, area of analysis, a conceptual site plan reflecting the
boundaries of the development, and information detailing the designated zoning
and physical features of the site and surrounding area.
         (b)   Existing conditions. Include a discussion about the existing
transportation network, roadway geometrics, traffic data collection, crash
analysis, existing level of service (LOS) and existing roadway capacity
analysis. Also include a discussion about nearby land developments and known
transportation improvements.
         (c)   Future conditions. Discuss the future transportation conditions
for the anticipated date of project completion. Include ambient background
traffic growth and anticipated future developments.
         (d)   Proposed condition. Discuss the proposed development
characteristics and determine the number of anticipated trips and traffic
distribution expected to occur as a result of the development. Provide a trip
generation analysis to determine traffic attributable to the development using
the most recent Institute of Transportation Engineering (ITE) Trip Generation
Manual. Determine trip distribution and assignment to the roadway network using
standard engineering practice and methodology contained in the ITE Trip
Generation Manual. Assess the traffic impacts attributable to the development
using the results from the trip generation and. Evaluate intersection LOS and
roadway capacity analysis.
         (e)   Recommendations. Provide recommendations to remedy deficiencies
in the transportation network caused by impacts from the development. These
recommendations shall include the engineer’s recommended location, nature and
extent of proposed transportation improvements, including bike and pedestrians
associated with the development to ensure safe and efficient roadway operations
and capacity, and compatibility with city standards and goals of the Greater
City of Deer Lodge Area Transportation Plan.
         (f)   Conclusion. Include a conclusion that provides a clear and
concise description of the study findings and engineer’s recommendations.
   (L)   Signing and pavement marking requirements.
      (1)   Street identification signs shall be installed at all new
intersections in accordance with the Montana Public Works Standard
Specifications (MPWSS), latest edition. All regulatory traffic-control signs
will be completed in accordance with the MUTCD. Stop signs shall be installed
on local streets when they intersect with any collector or arterial streets.
      (2)   All pavement markings shall be inlaid thermoplastic for all
crosswalks, stop bars, words and symbols. Roadway centerlines, bike lanes and
outside lane lines shall be epoxy paint. All pavement markings and reflective
glass beads will be constructed in accordance with MPWSS.
      (3)   Crosswalk markings should not be used indiscriminately. An
engineering study should be performed before crosswalks are installed at
locations away from traffic signals or stop signs. Mid-block crosswalks are
discouraged.
   (M)   Sidewalks. All sidewalk replacement or new sidewalk installation will
be constructed in accordance with MPWSS.
(Prior Code, § 11.05.050.020) (Ord. 2019-9, passed 9-3-2019; Ord. 2021-15,
passed 12-20-2021)
EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
§ 11.05.060.010 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The objective of the erosion and sediment control standards is to
minimize erosion of disturbed areas during the construction of a project.
Erosion and subsequent sediment transport can have a significant impact on the
water quality of receiving surface waters. Sediment loads to surface waters
increase turbidity, increase water temperatures, degrade fish habitat and
spawning areas, and depress dissolved oxygen concentrations. Moreover, toxic
substances, trace metals and nutrients which are absorbed to soil particles can
be transported into surface waters as well. The addition of these substances to
surface waters degrades the existing water quality.
   (B)   No run-off containing sediment shall be permitted to flow off of any
construction site. Sediment shall not be discharged into storm drainage
systems, waterways or wetlands. The contractor shall provide and maintain the
required sediment control barriers. The control barriers shall not be removed
until all roadways have been paved and a permanent and stable vegetation cover
has been established.
   (C)   BMPs for erosion and sediment control are selected to meet the BMP
objectives based on specific site conditions, construction activities and cost
effectiveness. Since construction site conditions are constantly changing,
different BMPs may be needed at different times during construction.
   (D)   In most cases, permanent BMPs can be implemented most effectively when
they can be integrated into other aspects of the project design. This requires
that stormwater control be considered early in the design process. Some BMPs
can be incorporated into stormwater detention facilities with modest design
refinements and limited increases in land area and cost.
(Prior Code, § 11.05.060.010) (Ord. 2019-9, passed 9-3-2019; Ord. 2021-15,
passed 12-20-2021)
§ 11.05.060.020 MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR AN EROSION CONTROL PLAN.
   An ESCP is required for land-disturbing activities which include, but are
not limited to, excavation, planting, tilling and grading, which disturbs the
natural or improved vegetative ground cover so as to expose soil to the erosive
forces of rain, stormwater run-off or wind. Any activity where the area
disturbed exceeds 5,000 square feet; provided it does not obstruct a
watercourse and is not located in a floodplain.
(Prior Code, § 11.05.060.020) (Ord. 2019-9, passed 9-3-2019; Ord. 2021-15,
passed 12-20-2021)
§ 11.05.060.030 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN (ESCP).
   (A)   A professional with a good working knowledge of hydrology and ESCP
practices, must prepare the ESCP. A copy of the ESCP must be located on the
construction site or within reasonable access to the site. As site construction
progresses, the ESC plan may require modification to reflect changes in site
conditions.
   (B)   In general, the ESCP will consist of a narrative and a drawing. The
project designer may choose to have the narrative included on a drawing or
issued as a report. The Montana Department of Transportation is a good source
for erosion control details (the Montana Department of Transportation Erosion
and Sediment Control Best Management Practices Manual). The ESCP must contain
sufficient information to demonstrate to the PWD that potential problems
associated with erosion, sediment and pollution have been adequately addressed
for the proposed project. The drawings and notes should be clear and concise
and describe when and where each BMP is to be implemented and details as
necessary.
(Prior Code, § 11.05.060.030) (Ord. 2019-9, passed 9-3-2019; Ord. 2021-15,
passed 12-20-2021)
§ 11.05.060.040 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR AN ESCP.
   At a minimum, the following items shall be addressed in the ESCP.
   (A)   Construction sequence.
      (1)   Install temporary BMPs; constructing sediment trapping BMPs as one
of the first steps prior to grading;
      (2)   Stabilize roadway approaches and temporary access points with the
appropriate construction entry BMP;
      (3)   Protect all permanent stormwater facilities utilizing the
appropriate BMPs;
      (4)   Install permanent ESC controls, when applicable; and
      (5)   Remove temporary ESC controls when:
         (a)   Permanent ESC controls, when applicable, have been completely
installed;
         (b)   All land-disturbing activities that have the potential to cause
erosion or sedimentation problems have ceased; and
         (c)   Vegetation had been established in the areas noted as requiring
vegetation on the accepted ESC plan on file with the City PWD.
   (B)   Construction access route.
      (1)   Limit access for construction vehicles to one route whenever
possible;
      (2)   Stabilize the construction access routes to minimize the tracking
of sediment onto roadways;
      (3)   Install temporary vehicle tracking approach at site entrance
locations;
      (4)   Inspect all roadways, at the end of each day, adjacent to the
construction access route. If it is evident that sediment has been tracked off-
site and/or beyond the roadway approach, removal and cleaning is required;
      (5)   If sediment removal is necessary prior to street washing, it shall
be removed by shoveling or sweeping and transported to a controlled sediment
disposal area; and
      (6)   If street washing is required to clean sediment tracked off-site,
once sediment has been removed, street wash wastewater shall be controlled by
pumping back on-site or otherwise prevented from discharging into systems
tributary to waters of the state; and, locate wheel washes or tire baths, if
applicable to ESCP, on site. Dispose of wastewater into a separate temporary
on-site treatment facility in a location other than where a permanent
stormwater facility is proposed.
   (C)   Protection of inlets.
      (1)   Protect inlets, drywells, catch basins and other stormwater
management facilities from sediment, whether or not facilities are operable, so
that stormwater run-off does not enter the conveyance system (both on- and off-
site) without being treated or filtered to remove sediment; and
      (2)   Keep roads adjacent to inlets clean; sediment and street wash water
shall not be allowed to enter the conveyance system (both on- and off-site)
without prior treatment.
   (D)   Run-off from construction sites.
      (1)   Protect down-gradient properties, waterways and stormwater
facilities from possible impacts due to increased flow rates, volumes and
velocities of stormwater run-off from the project site that may temporarily
occur during construction;
      (2)   Run-off from the construction site through the detention/retention
storage pond or swales shall be addressed in the construction sequence. No
sediment laden water shall pass through the flow control system and discharge
to an off-site storm conveyance system;
      (3)   Construct stormwater control facilities (detention/retention
storage pond or swales) before grading begins. These facilities shall be
operational before the construction of impervious site improvements; and
      (4)   Protect permanent infiltration facilities that are used for flow
control during construction.
   (E)   Washout site for concrete trucks and equipment. Designate the location
of a slurry pit where concrete trucks and equipment can be washed out. Slurry
pits are not to be located in or upstream of a swale, drainage area, stormwater
facility or water body, or in an area where a stormwater facility is existing
or proposed.
   (F)   Material storage/stockpile.
      (1)   Identify locations for storage/stockpile areas, within the proposed
ESCP boundaries, for any soil, earthen and landscape material that is used or
will be used on-site;
      (2)   Stockpile materials (such as, topsoil) on-site, keeping off roadway
and sidewalks; and
      (3)   Maintain on-site, as feasible, items such as gravel and a roll of
plastic, for emergency soil stabilization during a heavy rain event, or for
emergency berm construction.
   (G)   Permanent BMPs.
      (1)   Include permanent BMPs, if necessary, in the ESCP to ensure the
successful transition from temporary BMPs to permanent BMPs; and
      (2)   Restore and rehabilitate temporary BMPs that are proposed to remain
in place after construction as permanent BMPs.
   (H)   Maintenance of BMPs.
      (1)   Inspect on a regular basis (at a minimum, bi-weekly and daily
during/after a run-off producing storm event) and maintain all ESC BMPs to
ensure successful performance of the BMPs. Conduct maintenance and repair in
accordance with individual ESC BMPs outlined in this section; and
      (2)   Remove temporary ESC BMPs within 30 days after they are no longer
needed. Permanently stabilize areas that are disturbed during the removal
process.

passed 12-20-2021)
§ 11.05.060.050 STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   Construction sites or activities disturbing one acre or more, or when
stormwater discharge to state waters can occur, the MDEQ requirements for the
general permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction activity
apply. Requirement associated with the general permit and SWPPP can be found on
DEQ’s website.

§ 11.06.000.030 2014 MODEL REGULATIONS; PURPOSE AND CONSIDERATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Provide communities with current (2013) model regulations; the
1989, 1990, 1992 and 2006 versions are obsolete. Draft versions of the 2014
model were utilized in 2012 and 2013 by several communities and should be
updated;
      (2)   Provides a model and template for local land use regulations for
local floodplain hazard management;
      (3)   Communities participating in the national flood insurance program
are required to have up to date floodplain management regulations; and
      (4)   Includes state and FEMA minimum procedural and development
standards.
   (B)   Consideration.
      (1)   Substantial adherence to the model will facilitate reviews by DNRC
and FEMA.
      (2)   Legal cites to supporting federal and state statutes and
regulations are noted in the model and are for reference during drafting and
should be removed before final adoption. The information within the boxes is
informational and should be removed as well.
      (3)   Communities may adopt higher standards pursuant to MCA § 76-5-301
(1), and are denoted as “(higher standard)” following the specific regulation
in this model. Higher standards, as well as those suggested in the model may
have health and safety, as well as economic and ecological benefits to the
community. Those communities may have to make findings of fact when adopting
floodplain management regulations as to why the higher standards are
appropriate in their community.
      (4)   The regulated flood hazard area is required to be specifically
described and updated if necessary.
      (5)   Local regulations require local notice and adoption.
      (6)   The special review panel needs to be specified in the variance and
administrative appeals sections.
      (7)   DNRC must find the local floodplain hazard mitigation regulations
are adequate before local adoption, allow 30 days for review.
      (8)   FEMA Region VIII must find the regulations adequate and acceptable
before community adoption as well, allow 30 days for review.
      (9)   Local regulations are required to be updated to the current state
and FEMA minimum regulatory standards within six months of a state or FEMA
revision or update to the regulated flood hazard area.
      (10)   Adopting the requirements by regulation, resolution or ordinance
as the appropriate vehicle must be determined by the political subdivision.

impact other land, flood water depth or velocity of floodwaters;
   (F)   Distinguish between the land use regulations applied to the floodway
within the regulated flood hazard area and those applied to that portion of the
regulated flood hazard area not contained in the floodway;
   (G)   Apply more restrictive land use regulations within the floodway of the
regulated flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that regulations and minimum standards balance the greatest
public good with the least private injury.
(Prior Code, § 11.06.010.050) (Ord. 6, passed 3-16-1981; Ord. 2021-15, passed

§ 11.06.010.060 REGULATED AREA.
   (A)   These regulations apply only to the flood hazard areas specifically
adopted herein as regulated flood hazard areas which are more fully and
specifically described in §
§ 11.06.040.010 through 11.06.040.30. Requirements and approvals for
alterations to the regulated flood hazard area are specified in §
§ 11.06.040.010 through 11.06.040.030. The regulated flood hazard area includes
areas specifically identified, labeled and illustrated on maps, such as
floodplain, floodway or flood fringe that have differing uses allowed and
minimum building standards that apply. The regulated flood hazard area is the
geographic area inundated by the flood of 100-year frequency illustrated and
depicted in the referenced studies and maps.
   (B)   The regulated flood hazard area supporting study and maps illustrating
the regulatory area are based on studies and maps that have been specifically
adopted pursuant to MCA §§ 76-5-201 et seq.
      (1)   The maps and accompanying study become the regulated flood hazard
area only when formally adopted by DNRC and subsequently by the political
subdivision by these regulations.
      (2)   The original source of studies and data may be from a flood
insurance study by FEMA, or other studies by Corps of Engineers, Soil
Conservation, United States Geological Service or other federal or state
agency.

§ 11.06.010.150 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Records, including permits and applications, elevation and flood proofing
certificates, certificates of compliance, fee receipts, and other matters
relating to these regulations must be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator and are public records, and must be made available for inspection
and for copies upon reasonable request. A reasonable copying cost for copying
documents for members of the public may be charged and may require payments of
the costs before providing the copies (44 C.F.R. § 59.22(a)(9)(iii); 44 C.F.R.

(Prior Code, § 11.06.010.150) (Ord. 6, passed 3-16-1981; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.06.010.160 SUBDIVISION REVIEW.
   (A)   Within the regulated flood hazard area, subdivisions including new or
expansion of existing manufactured home parks must be designed to meet the
following criteria:
      (1)   The base flood elevations and boundary of the regulated flood
hazard area must be determined and considered during lot layout and building
location design;
      (2)   Locations for future structures and development must be reasonably
safe from flooding (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(a)(4));
      (3)   Adequate surface water drainage must be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(a)(4)(iii));
      (4)   Public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems must be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage; and (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(a)(4)(ii)); and
      (5)   Floodplain permits must be obtained according to these regulations
before development occurs that is within the regulated flood hazard area (44
C.F.R. § 60.3(b)).
   (B)   Example for informational purposes only: the national flood insurance
program (NFIP) standard for community floodplain management ordinances
specifies that the local government is to consider flood hazards when reviewing
and approving subdivisions within the special flood hazard area. Floodplain
administrators should check their subdivision ordinances to ensure flood
hazards outside of regulated flood hazard areas are addressed in development
proposals. For example, the state model subdivision regulations suggests that
for any portion of a proposed subdivision that is within 2,000 horizontal feet
and 20 vertical feet of a stream draining an area of 25 square miles or more,
where no official floodplain studies of the stream have been made, the
subdivider may be required to conduct a flood hazard evaluation study. The
Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation may, if requested,
review the flood hazard analysis on the merit of its technical adequacy and
make a recommendation back to the Floodplain Administrator. A technical review
by DNRC is not intended to be a formal designation of a floodplain or floodway
pursuant to MCA §§ 76-5-201 et seq. for floodplain management regulatory
purposes, unless specifically requested and subsequently adopted by DNRC.

12-20-2021)
§ 11.06.010.170 DISASTER RECOVERY.
   (A)   In the event of a natural or human-made disaster, the Floodplain
Administrator should participate in the coordination of assistance and provide
information to structure owners concerning hazard mitigation and recovery
measures with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Montana Disaster
Emergency Services, Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation,
and other state, local and private emergency service organizations.
   (B)   Upon completion of cursory street view structure condition survey
within the regulated flood hazard area, the Floodplain Administrator shall
notify owners that a permit may be necessary for an alteration or substantial
improvement before repair or reconstruction commences on damaged structures
because of damages caused by natural or human-made disasters, such as floods,
fires or winds.
   (C)   Owners should be advised that structures that have suffered
substantial damage and will undergo substantial improvements require a
floodplain application and permit, and must be upgraded to meet the minimum
building standards herein during repair or reconstruction (ARM § 36.15.702; 44
C.F.R. § 60.3(c)(2), (3)).

REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
§ 11.06.040.010 REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   The regulated flood hazard areas are the 100-year floodplains
illustrated and referenced in the following specific studies and reports
described as follows:
      (1)   Specific title and order date of specific flood study including
maps and areas of the 100-year floodplain;
      (2)   A list of subsequent amendments to the regulated flood hazard area;
and
      (3)   Other specific studies or and orders.
      (4)   Example for informational purposes only:
         (a)   August 16, 2014 FEMA flood insurance study (FIS) and flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMs) for Missoula County, Montana;
         (b)   As amended in conformance with DNRC approval dated July 15, 2015
and FEMA conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) dated August 16, 2015; and
         (c)   Floodplain management study for Swan River adopted by DNRC on
July 10, 2016.
   (B)   The regulated flood hazard areas specifically described or illustrated
in the above referenced studies and maps of the 100-year floodplain have been
delineated, designated and established by order or determination by the DNRC
pursuant to MCA §§ 76-5-201et seq.
   (C)   Use allowances, design and construction requirements specifically in §
§ 11.06.010.050, 10.06.010.060, 11.06.010.090 and 11.06.010.100 vary by the
specific floodplain areas, including areas identified as floodway and flood
fringe within the regulated flood hazard area.
(Prior Code, § 11.06.040.010) (Ord. 6, passed 3-16-1981; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.06.040.020 INTERPRETATION OF REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   The mapped boundaries of the floodplain illustrated in the referenced
studies and maps in this section are a guide for determining whether property
is within the regulated flood hazard area.
   (B)   A determination of the outer limits and boundaries of the regulated
flood hazard area or the flood fringe and floodway within the regulated flood
hazard area includes an evaluation of the maps, as well as the particular study
data referenced in this section. Supporting study material for base flood
elevations takes precedence over any map illustrations if it exists.
   (C)   The regulated flood hazard area boundary is delineated by the base
flood elevation. The physical field regulatory boundary of the regulated flood
hazard area is the actual intersection of the applicable study base flood
elevation with the existing adjacent terrain of the watercourse or drainway
(ARM § 36.15.501(6)).
   (D)   The floodway boundary where identified within the floodplain is as
illustrated on the referenced maps and studies. Since the floodway boundary is
a study feature, the location of the boundary may be physically located by
referencing the study data to a ground feature. The Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of the boundary and decision may be appealed as set forth in
§ 11.06.010.130.
   (E)   The Floodplain Administrator may request additional information
described below to determine whether or not the proposed development is within
the regulated flood hazard area.
      (1)   Where base flood elevations exist, the property owner may provide
additional information which may include elevation information provided by an
engineer or land surveyor in order to determine if the proposed development is
subject to these regulations (ARM § 36.15.501(6)).
      (2)   Where base flood elevations do not exist, the property owner may
provide additional information to be considered to determine the location of
the regulatory boundary or alternatively provide a computed base flood
elevation provided by an engineer.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of the boundaries and
decision may be appealed as set forth in
§ 11.06.010.130.
   (F)   Any owner or lessee of property who believes his or her property has
been inadvertently included in the regulated flood hazard area, including the
floodway or flood fringe, may submit scientific and/or technical information to
the Floodplain Administrator for a determination if the property is
appropriately located.
      (1)   Scientific or technical information submitted to FEMA by an owner
to affect the insurance rating for insurance purposes may be considered by the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   (a)   A determination by the Floodplain Administrator is
independent of any determination by FEMA for insurance purposes.
         (b)   Example for informational purposes only: when property located
within the regulated flood hazard area is naturally above the base flood
elevation as proven by a certified elevation survey provided by an engineer or
land surveyor, the property owner may submit a letter of map amendment (LOMA)
to FEMA in order to affect the flood risk designation for insurance purposes.
Information on the process and requirements are available through FEMA.
(Prior Code, § 11.06.040.020) (Ord. 6, passed 3-16-1981; Ord. 2021-15, passed
12-20-2021)
§ 11.06.040.030 ALTERATION OF REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (A)   Revisions or updates to the specific maps and data that alter the
established floodplains or floodway of the regulated flood hazard area requires
DNRC approval pursuant to MCA § 75-5-203. An alteration of the regulated flood
hazard area is a DNRC approved amendment to the DNRC order that originally
delineated and designated the 100-year floodplain and is the basis of the
regulated flood hazard area referenced in
§ 11.06.040.010(B).
   (B)   A DNRC approved alteration consists of revisions or updates to the
specific maps and data of the referenced studies in this section and forms the
basis for an amendment to the regulated flood hazard area in these regulations
(ARM § 36.15.505):
      (1)   Any change to the regulated flood hazard area as a result of a DNRC
alteration is effective upon amendment to the regulated flood hazard area
described in
§ 11.06.040.010(B);
      (2)   Substantial natural physical change or new technical or scientific
flood data showing that the base flood elevation has or may be changed or was
erroneously established shall be brought to the attention of DNRC and FEMA (ARM
§ 36.15.505(1)(a); 44 C.F.R. § 65.3);
      (3)   Any floodplain permit application for a proposed development or
artificial obstruction must be denied until a DNRC alteration pursuant to MCA §
76-5-203 is approved if it causes an increase of one-half foot or more to the
base flood elevation of a regulated flood hazard area without a floodway or an
increase of more than zero feet to the base flood elevation of a floodway;
      (4)   To propose an alteration, a petition must be submitted to DNRC and
must include the following information:
         (a)   Certification that no buildings are located in the areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation (C.F.R. § 65.12(a)(5));
         (b)   Evidence of notice to all property and landowners of the
proposed impacts to their properties explaining the proposed impact on their
property (44 C.F.R. § 65.12(a)(3));
         (c)   Information that demonstrates that alternatives are not feasible
(C.F.R. § 65.12(2));
         (d)   Information that demonstrates that development is for a public
use or benefit; and
         (e)   Any other supporting information and data as needed for
approvals. (ARM § 36.15.505; 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(c)(10); 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(d)(3);
44 C.F.R. § 65.7(3); 44 C.F.R. § 65.12)
      (5)   (a)   The Floodplain Administrator may represent the permit
authority for any necessary applications, approvals or endorsements, such as
the FEMA community acknowledgement form to FEMA where affecting the FEMA
special flood hazard area.
         (b)   Example for informational purposes only: once DNRC approves an
alteration and the community amends the regulated flood hazard area, the
community is then required per agreement between the community and FEMA to
obtain approval by CLOMR from FEMA before there is any physical change to the
special flood hazard area. (C.F.R. § 59.21; 44 C.F.R. § 65.12)
      (6)   A determination by the Floodplain Administrator that land areas
located within the regulated flood hazard area are above the base flood
elevation as proven by a certified elevation survey does not constitute or
require an alteration or an amendment of the regulated flood hazard area and
may be maintained as a public record that more explicitly defines the regulated
flood hazard area boundary;
      (7)   Elevating with suitable fill as permitted does not alter the
regulated flood hazard area or remove the elevated area from the regulated
flood hazard area (ARM § 36.15.505(2)); and
      (8)   A floodplain permit implementing the physical change cannot be
approved until a CLOMR has been issued by FEMA.

determination that the variance is the minimum allowance necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief from these regulations and provided all of
the following criteria are met:
      (1)   There is a good and sufficient cause. Financial hardship is not a
good and sufficient cause (44 C.F.R. § 60.6(a)(3));
      (2)   Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship
to the applicant (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(a)(3); ARM § 36.15.218(b));

      (8)   Reasonable alternative locations are not available (ARM § 36.15.218
(d));
      (9)   An encroachment does not cause an increase to the base flood
elevation that is beyond that allowed in these regulations and (44 C.F.R. §
60.6(a)(1)); and
      (10)   All other criteria for a floodplain permit besides the specific
development standard requested by variance are met.
   (B)   An exception to the variance criteria may be allowed as follows:
      (1)   For either new construction of a structure outside of the floodway
only or for substantial improvements or an alteration of a structure, on a lot
of one-half acres or less that is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation (44 C.F.R. §
60.6(a)); or
      (2)   For historic structures, variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum relief
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. The
historic nature of the building must be designated as a preliminary or historic
structure by U.S. Secretary of Interior or an approved state or local
government historic preservation program (44 C.F.R. § 60.6(a)).

making such opening and the property owner for which such opening is made,
between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., shall keep red lantern lights
burning or adequate flares placed at said excavation, one on each end thereof
along such excavation so that the same can be seen from five feet or fraction

or dirt or other objects of material, and must be so placed that said
reflectors can be seen by anyone approaching alongside the opening or
obstruction, and as many red reflectors shall be used as red lantern lights
otherwise required. Such reflectors must be accepted and passed upon by the

services using facilities located wholly or partly in the public right-of-ways
of the grantor, the grantor shall, within 30 days of a written request from
grantee, modify this franchise to ensure that the obligations applicable to
grantee are no more burdensome than those imposed on the new competing

grantee’s initial written notice. As an alternative to the franchise
modification request, the grantee shall have the right and may choose to have
this franchise with the grantor be deemed expired 30 days after written notice

to terminate this franchise and, at grantee’s option, negotiate a renewal or
