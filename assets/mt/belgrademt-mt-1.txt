ARTICLE III
CAPITALIZATION POLICY FOR FIXED ASSETS
3.01. Fixed Assets
This policy establishes the criteria for capitalizing a fixed asset, as well as
the distinction between the treatment of maintenance costs versus additions,
betterment, and extraordinary repairs.
   A.   Fixed Asset: A fixed asset is property that meets all of the following
requirements:
      1.   Must be tangible in nature.
      2.   Must have a useful life of two (2) years or longer.
      3.   Must be of significant value.
   B.   Method Of Acquisition: Fixed assets may be acquired through donation,
purchases, or may be self-constructed.
      1.   Donations: The asset value for donations would be the fair market
value at the time of the donation.
      2.   Purchases: The asset value when purchased, is the initial cost plus
the original cost of the old asset given up, plus all costs of placing the
asset into operation. When the original cost of the old asset is unknown, use
the secondhand market price of the old asset.
      3.   Self-Constructed: The cost of the self-constructed assets should
include both the materials used and the cost of labor involved in the
construction of the asset.
   C.   Values Of Assets: The core of the capitalization policy is the
establishment of significant values for the different classes of assets.
      1.   Determination Of Significant Values: The following values shall be
used for determining significant values when capitalizing fixed assets:
 
Class Of Fixed Asset              Significant Value
Equipment and machinery           $10,000.00
Improvements other than buildings 10,000.00
Infrastructure                    25,000.00
Land                              All
Buildings                         All
 
      2.   Cost Below Significant Value: All machinery, equipment, buildings,
and improvements other than buildings, that have a cost below these significant
values should be expensed at the time of purchase. (Ord. 2016-2, 4-18-2016)
3.02. Maintenance Costs
Maintenance costs are those expenditures which are necessary to keep an asset
in its intended operating condition but which do not materially increases the
value or physical properties of the asset. Maintenance costs shall not be
capitalized and shall be charged against the appropriate expenditure account in
the current period.
3.03. Additions To Assets
Additions refer to a physical extension of an existing asset or the acquisition
of an entirely new asset which does not replace an existing asset. Additions
should be capitalized at cost when acquired or when construction is completed;
provided, that they are tangible in nature have a useful life of greater than
one year, and are of significant value.
3.04. Betterment Of Assets
Betterment exists when a part of an existing asset is replaced by another, and
the replacement provides a significant increase in the life or value of the
asset. The amount to be capitalized when a betterment is determined should be
the difference between the cost of the new asset and the cost of the asset it
replaces.
3.05. Extraordinary Repairs
Extraordinary repairs are those necessary costs related to the repair of a
substantial part of an asset. If adequate records are maintained or where
depreciation is not a factor, the cost of the replaced parts should be removed
from the asset account, along with any depreciation and the new part(s) added
to the asset account inclusive of the entire cost related to repairs. If
depreciation has been used and there are inadequate records, then charging of
the entire cost of repair to the accumulated depreciation account is
acceptable. (Ord. 92-2, 5-18-1992; amd. Ord. 2004-4, 4-5-2004; 2009 Code)

(Ord. 2024-3, 3-4-2024)
1-8-9: IMPACT FEES:
1-8-9-1: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
The city council finds that:
   A.   Capital improvements to streets, fire protection, water and sewer
systems, and parks are necessary to accommodate continued growth within the
city to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the
city.
   B.   New residential and nonresidential development imposes increased and
excessive demands upon existing city facilities.
   C.   New development often overburdens existing public facilities and the
tax revenues generated from new development often do not generate sufficient
funds to provide public facilities to serve the new development.
   D.   New development is expected to continue, and will place ever increasing
demands on the city to provide public facilities to serve new development.
   E.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the city to
impose a proportionate share of the costs that are reasonably related to the
capital improvement demands of new development.
   F.   The impact fee study, dated February 14, 2007, and as updated, prepared
by TischlerBise Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants, sets forth reasonable
methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of
development on the city streets, fire protection, water and sewer systems, and
parks necessary to meet the demands for such services created by new
development.
   G.   The city establishes, as city standards, the assumptions and service
standards referenced in the impact fee studies as part of its current plans for
the major street system and for city fire protection, water and sewer systems
and parks.
   H.   The impact fees described in this article are based on the impact fee
study, and do not exceed the maximum impact fee determined by the impact fee
study.
   I.   The impact fees adopted in this article are reasonably related to and
reasonably attributable to the development’s share of the cost of
infrastructure improvements made necessary by the new development.
   J.   After the consideration of the need for capital improvements required
to serve new development, and after consideration of the payments for capital
improvements reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of the
development in the form of user fees, debt service payments, taxes and other
available sources of funding the capital improvements, the city council
determined that the impact fees adopted in this article do not exceed a
proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the city in
accommodating the development and are reasonably related to the benefits
accruing to the development paying the impact fees.
   K.   The types of infrastructure included in the impact fee study all have
citywide service areas. Therefore, impact fees will be imposed on a citywide
basis with one benefit district comprised of all land within the city limits.
   L.   This article creates a system by which impact fees will be used to
expand or improve the city streets, fire protection, water and sewer systems,
and parks in ways that benefit the development that paid each fee within a
reasonable period of time after the fee is paid.
   M.   This article creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to cure existing deficiencies in public facilities.
   N.   This article does not hold new development to a higher level of service
than existing users unless there is a mechanism in place for the existing users
to make improvements to the existing system to match the higher level of
service.
   O.   It is in the best interests of the city and new development to include
an administrative surcharge, not to exceed five percent (5%) of the total
impact fee, to help cover impact fee expenses.
   P.   The capital improvement plan for growth related projects adopted by the
city must cover at least a five (5) year period, and must be reviewed and
updated at least every two (2) years.
   Q.   This article adopts policies and procedures related to site specific
credits or developer reimbursements that are reasonably designed to avoid
double payment for growth related capital improvements. (Ord. 2007-11, 12-17-

   A.   Pro Rata Credit: After the effective date hereof, all mandatory or
voluntary monetary contributions for, land or easement dedications for, or
acquisition or construction of, capital improvements by an applicant in
connection with a proposed development may, at the discretion of the city
council, result in a pro rata credit against the impact fee for the same type
of service or facility otherwise due for such development, except that no such
credit shall be awarded for:
      1.   Projects not listed on the impact fee capital improvements program;
or
      2.   Land or easement dedications for, or acquisition or construction of,
project related improvements required as a condition of preliminary plat
approval, or other approval, of a development or subdivision; or
      3.   Any voluntary land or easement dedications not accepted by the city;
or
      4.   Any voluntary acquisition or construction of improvements not
approved, in writing, by the city prior to commencement of the acquisition or
construction.
   B.   Application: In order to obtain a credit against development impact
fees otherwise due, an applicant must submit a written offer to make a specific
monetary contribution for, to dedicate to the city specific parcels of
qualifying land or easements, or to acquire or construct specific capital
improvements in accordance with all applicable state or city design and
construction standards, and must specifically request a credit against such
impact fees. Such written request must be made on a form provided by the city,
must contain a statement under oath of the facts that qualify the applicant to
receive a credit, must be accompanied by documents evidencing those facts, and
must be filed not later than the initiation of construction of improvements or
the acceptance by the city of monetary contributions, land or easement
dedications, or the applicant’s claim for the credit shall be waived. The
granting of credit shall not occur without the approval of the city council.
   C.   Calculation Of Credit: The credit due to an applicant shall be
calculated and documented as follows:
      1.   Credit for qualifying land or easement dedications shall, at the
applicant’s option, be valued at:
         a.   One hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for
such land as shown in the records of the city assessor; or
         b.   That fair market value established by a private appraiser
acceptable to the city in an appraisal paid for by the applicant.
      2.   In order to receive credit for qualifying acquisition or
construction of capital improvements, the applicant shall submit complete
engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates to the
city. The city shall determine the amount of credit due based on the
information submitted, or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate
or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable
to the city.
   D.   Approved Credits Become Effective: Approved credits shall become
effective at the following times:
      1.   Approved credit for land or easement dedications shall become
effective when the land has been conveyed to the city in a form acceptable to
the city, and at no cost to the city, and has been accepted by the city
council. When such conditions have been met, the city shall note that fact in
the credit record maintained by the city finance department. Upon request of
the credit holder, the city shall send the credit holder a letter stating the
credit balance available to him (or her).
      2.   Approved credits for the acquisition or construction of capital
improvements shall generally become effective when:
         a.   All required construction has been completed and has been
accepted by the city; and
         b.   A suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and
approved by the city; and
         c.   All design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and
acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
city and state procedures.
            However, approved credits for the construction of improvements may
become effective at an earlier date if the applicant posts security in the form
of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow agreement, and
the amount and terms of such security are accepted by the city. At a minimum,
such security must be in the amount of the approved credit or an amount
determined to be adequate to allow the city to construct the improvements for
which the credit was given, whichever is higher. When such conditions have been
met, the city shall note that fact in the credit record maintained by the city
finance department. Upon request of the credit holder, the city shall also send
the credit holder a letter stating the credit balance available to him (or
her).
   E.   Use Of Credit: Approved credits may be used to reduce the amount of
impact fees due from any proposed development for the same type of service or
facility for which the applicant made a monetary contribution, dedicated land
or easements, or acquired or constructed improvements, until the amount of the
credit is exhausted. Each time a request to use credit from a mandatory or
voluntary contribution, dedication, acquisition, or construction is presented
to the city, the city shall reduce the amount of the impact fee of the same
type otherwise due from the applicant and shall note in the city records the
amount of credit remaining, if any. In the case of a mandatory contribution,
dedication, acquisition, or construction, any credit in excess of the amount of
the impact fee otherwise due under this article shall be deemed excess credit
that is remaining and available for use by the applicant. In the case of a
voluntary contribution, dedication, acquisition, or construction, any credit in
excess of the amount of the impact fee of the same type and applicable to the
project, shall be deemed excess credit that is remaining and available for use
by the applicant. Upon request of the credit holder, the city shall also send
the credit holder a letter stating the amount of credit remaining to him (or
her).
   F.   Use Of Credit Against Other Fees: Approved credit shall only be used to
reduce the amount of development impact fees of the same type otherwise due
under this article and shall not be paid to the applicant in cash or in credit
against any impact fees for a different type of facility or service or against
any other monies due from the applicant to the city, except as described in
subsection G of this section.
   G.   Request For Reimbursement: If the amount of approved credit for a
mandatory contribution, dedication, acquisition, or construction exceeds the
amount of the impact fees of the same type otherwise due under this article,
the applicant may request, in writing, that the city provide for reimbursement
of any excess credit to the applicant in cash. Such written request must be
filed not later than the initiation of construction of improvements, or the
acceptance by the city of contributions or land or easement dedications, or the
applicant’s claim shall be waived. Upon receipt of such a written request, the
city may, at its discretion:
      1.   Arrange for the reimbursement of such excess credit from the impact
fee fund for the same type of service or facility from impact fees paid by
others; or
      2.   Reject the request for cash and provide credit. Such excess credit
shall be valued at one hundred percent (100%) of actual developer costs for the
excess improvements, or at the actual appraised value of such excess
improvements, at the city’s option.
   H.   Transfer Of Credit: Credit may be transferred from one holder to
another by any written instrument clearly identifying the credit issued under
subsection C of this section that is to be transferred; provided, that such
instrument is signed by both the transferor and transferee, and that the
document is delivered to the city for registration of the change in ownership.
   I.   Means And Method Of Valuation: The city council shall determine a means
and method of valuation of the proposed dedication or constructions to
establish credits against future impact fee revenue if the dedication of land
or construction of public facilities is of worth in excess of the impact fee
due from an individual development. (Ord. 2007-11, 12-17-2007; amd. Ord. 2019-
2, 5-20-2019; Ord. 2024-3, 3-4-2024)

be considered part of such fund, and shall be subject to the same restrictions
on use applicable to the impact fees deposited in such fund.
   B.   Use Of Funds: No monies from any impact fee fund shall be spent for
operations or maintenance of any facility or to cure deficiencies in public
facilities existing on the effective date of this chapter.
   C.   Project Improvements: Nothing in this article shall restrict the city
from requiring an applicant to construct reasonable project improvements
required to serve the applicant’s project, whether or not such improvements are
of a type for which credit is available under section
1-8-9-12 of this article.
   D.   Records: The city shall maintain accurate records of impact fees paid,
including the name of the person paying such fees, the project for which the
fees were paid, the date of payment of each fee, the amounts received in
payment for each fee, and any other matters that the city deems appropriate or
necessary to the accurate accounting of such fees, and such records shall be
available for review by the public during city business hours.
   E.   Component of City Budget: There shall be a component of the city budget
that schedules construction of public facility capital improvements to serve
projected growth; projects costs of capital improvements; allocates collected
impact fees for construction of the capital improvements; and covers at least a
5-year period and is reviewed and updated at least every 5 years.
   F.   Mistakes Or Misrepresentations:
      1.   Overpayments: If an impact fee has been calculated and paid based on
a mistake or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. Any amounts overpaid
by an applicant shall be refunded by the city to the applicant within thirty
(30) days after the city’s acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest
at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum since the date of such overpayment.
      2.   Underpayments: Any amounts underpaid by the applicant shall be paid
to the city within thirty (30) days after the city’s acceptance of the
recalculated amount, with interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum

      3.   City Error: In the event the underpayment is caused by an error
attributed solely to the city, the applicant shall pay the recalculated amount
without interest.
      4.   Issuance Of Additional Permits Or Approvals: In the case of an
underpayment to the city, the city shall not issue any additional permits or
approvals for the project for which the development impact fee was previously
paid until such underpayment is corrected, and if amounts owed to the city are
not paid within such thirty (30) day period, the city may also repeal any
permits issued in reliance on the previous payment of such impact fee and
refund such fee to the then current owner of the land.
   G.   Update: The service area report for each public facility for which an
impact fee is imposed shall be periodically updated approximately once every
five fiscal years. The service area report must comply with the requirements of
Section 7-6-1602, Montana Code Annotated.
   H.   Judicial Action Or Proceeding: Any judicial action or proceeding to
attack, review, set aside or annul the reasonableness, legality or validity of
any impact fee must be filed within ninety (90) days following the date of
imposition of the fee or the final determination of the city council, whichever
is the later. (Ord. 2013-5, 6-17-2013; amd. Ord. 2019-2, 5-20-2019; Ord. 2024-

Belgrade City Code.
   D.   A party wishing to keep chickens shall submit an application to the
City of Belgrade for this purpose. The application shall contain the following:

keep chickens shall obtain a new permit regardless of whether chickens were
kept on the property or continue to be kept on the property.
   G.   Approval of a permit to keep chickens authorizes the permit holder to
keep the number of chickens in the manner described on the application and

such the keeping of chickens, and all yards, spaces, fences, and enclosures are
adequate to properly relate such use with the land and uses in the vicinity;

properties or residents; and

determination that a violation of this article or other parking prohibition has
been committed by the owner or user of the vehicle and that the determination
shall be final unless contested as provided by this chapter;

Code Annotated section violated and for which the citation was issued;

department and may be disposed of only by official action of the city or by
payment of a fine to the finance department.

either paying the penalty set forth in the notice or requesting an
administrative appeal pursuant to subsection F of this section. If the person
provided notice fails to either pay the penalty or request an administrative
appeal within ten (10) business days, said failure shall result in the
assessment of a thirty dollars ($30.00) administrative fee which shall be in
addition to the penalty.
      2.   If the owner of a vehicle cited for a parking violation has not
responded to the notice of violation within ten (10) business days as provided

Such notice shall state that if the owner of the vehicle does not respond to
the notice by either paying the penalty and administrative fee or by requesting
in writing an administrative appeal pursuant to these procedures within (10)
ten business days of the date of the notice, the owner shall be deemed to have
waived the owner's right to an administrative appeal and the determination that
a violation was committed shall be considered final. Any person who fails to
request an administrative appeal or pay the penalty and administrative fee
within the ten (10) business days of the notice described in this subsection
shall be deemed to have refused to pay the penalty and administrative fee and
the city shall be authorized to proceed to collect the fine and all
administrative fees in any manner available to the city.
      3.   All payments made by a person regarding a notice of a violation
under this article shall be paid only to the city finance department.
   F.   Administrative Appeal Of Parking Citation: Any person cited for a
violation of this article may contest the determination that a violation
occurred by submitting to the city a notice of administrative appeal of parking
citation within ten (10) business days of issuance of notice of violation. The
notice of appeal must contain a written statement detailing the appellant's
argument that the citation was issued in error and may include photographs, or

and, within twenty one (21) days of submittal of the notice of appeal, the city
shall inform the appellant via regular mail or other communication approved by
the appellant, whether the citation is affirmed, modified, or dismissed. If the
citing officer's decision is affirmed or modified, the petitioner shall have
ten (10) business days from the date of mailing or other approved communication
of the decision to pay the penalty. Failure to pay within said ten (10)
business day period shall result in the assessment of a sixty dollars ($60.00)
administrative fee which shall be in addition to the penalty, and shall
authorize the city to proceed to collect the fine and all administrative fees
in any manner available to the city.
   G.   Rehearing And Judicial Review:

submitted to the review board within ten (10) business days of notice of the
administrative reviewer's determination. The review board shall have the power
to review the facts and the law in order to affirm, reverse, or modify any
original decision for error of fact or law.
      3.   Procedure: The hearing shall afford a reasonable opportunity for
person(s) to demonstrate by the statements of witnesses and other evidence that

necessary rules and regulations regarding the conduct of such hearings.
      4.   Appearance Of Officer: The officer or other person authorized by the
city who issued the notice of violation shall not be required to appear at the

available at the time of the hearing.
      5.   Determination: At the conclusion of the hearing, the review board
shall immediately render a decision, either finding the person liable and
assessing a fine pursuant to subsection A1 of this section, or declaring the
violation unproven.
      6.   Failure To Appear: Failure of the appellant to appear at a hearing
when required to appear shall constitute an admission of the parking violation
and shall subject the person charged with the violation to the appropriate
fines and costs assessed by the city acting through the review board and shall
authorize the city to proceed to collect the fine and all administrative fees
in any manner available to the city.
      7.   Final Decision: The decision of the review board shall be the final
decision by the city. Any person aggrieved by a decision may file a petition
for judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction. An appeal must be
brought within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision of the review
board, and confined to review of the record and questions of law.
   H.   Immobilization Of Vehicle:
      1.   Actions under this subsection H1 to immobilize a vehicle are for the
purpose of collection and are not considered a penalty. The city may, using any
immobilization device (i.e., a "boot"), immobilize any vehicle while parked
legally or illegally upon the ways of the city open to the public when:
         a.   The vehicle is subject to three (3) or more unpaid violations of
this article as determined by subsection H3 of this section regarding that
vehicle;
         b.   An owner of the vehicle has three (3) or more unpaid violations
of this article as determined by subsection H3 of this section and those
violations were issued for any vehicle the person currently owns or has owned;
or
         c.   A city court or municipal judge has ordered the vehicle

delivery confirmation requested a notice to the last known address of the owner
of any vehicle having three (3) or more unpaid violations of this article as
determined by subsection H3 of this section that the vehicle may be impounded
or immobilized when located upon the ways of the city open to the public. The
notice must reference all the unpaid violations of this article against the
vehicle or the owner and allow the person ten (10) business days from the date
of mailing of the notice to pay all unpaid violations of this article or
contest the determination the vehicle is subject to immobilization in the city
or municipal court. If the vehicle owner does not respond within ten (10)
business days of the date of the mailing, the city may immobilize or impound
the vehicle.

determining the number of violations that subject a vehicle to immobilization:

chapter:
         b.   Any violation occurring prior to the effective date of this
chapter, wherein a summons and compliant has been lawfully served on the
vehicle owner; and

entered by the city court or municipal court as long as the judgment occurred
no more than ten (10) years prior to the date the notice of a pending
immobilization is sent pursuant to subsection H2 of this section.
      4.   A one hundred fifty dollar ($150.00) immobilization fee and costs of
immobilization and impoundment will be assessed against the owner and must be
paid prior to release.
      5.   At the time a vehicle is immobilized, the city shall conspicuously
affix to the vehicle a written notice via a highly visible sticker or other
material with an adhesive backing that can be fastened to the driver-side
window containing the following information:
         This vehicle has been immobilized for three (3) or more unpaid
violations of Title 5, Chapter 4 of the Belgrade City Code or by Order of the
Belgrade City or Municipal Court. Release from immobilization may be obtained
by paying all unpaid violations at City Hall, 91 East Central, Belgrade,
Montana, or by appearing in Belgrade City or Municipal Court, 91 East Central,
Belgrade, Montana, to answer to the unpaid violations. All assessed fees,
including a $150.00 fee for immobilization, must be paid prior to release of
this vehicle. If the vehicle remains immobilized for more than 24 hours, the
vehicle is subject to being towed and impounded as provided in Title 5, Chapter
5 of the Belgrade City Code, with additional fees assessed at that time.
Removal or attempted removal of the immobilization device before a release is
obtained is unlawful and may be punishable as a criminal offense subject to the
penalty provided in Title 1, Chapter 4 of the Belgrade City Code. The owner may
contest the action of immobilization and/or impoundment by filing a request for
a hearing with the Belgrade City or Municipal Court within ten (10) business
days of the immobilization or impoundment. Please call 406-388-4262 for
information on how to release this vehicle.
      6.   If the vehicle has been immobilized, and has remained immobilized
for a period of twenty four (24) hours or longer, and a release has not been
obtained from the city or the city court or municipal court, then the city may
impound the vehicle as provided for in subsection I of this section.
      7.   Nothing herein shall prohibit the city from providing alternative
methods of notice that a vehicle is subject to immobilization or that a vehicle
has been immobilized.
   I.   Removal/Impoundment Of Vehicle:
      1.   The city, or authorized agent of the city, is authorized to remove

and in compliance with Montana Code Annotated section 61-12-402, such officer
or another city employee shall send a notice by certified mail within seventy
two (72) hours to such owner and lien-holder, if applicable, of the fact of
such removal and the reasons thereof and of the place to which such vehicle has
been removed. If any such vehicle is stored in a public garage or other storage
facility, a copy of such notice shall be given to the attendant or owner of the
facility. Further, a city employee authorizing the removal of the vehicle,

within the city court or municipal court. The owner shall state in writing
whether the payments made are in full satisfaction of all debts and judgments
or whether the owner is making payment as a bond and will challenge the
immobilization or impoundment with the city court or municipal court. If at the
time of vehicle release the owner posts a bond pursuant to subsection E1b of
this section and yet fails to challenge the immobilization or impoundment
pursuant to subsection K of this section, the bond shall be forfeited and
considered as final payment for all debts and judgments listed in subsection
J2c of this section.
   K.   Hearing For Vehicle Immobilization Or Towing/Impoundment:
      1.   Within ten (10) business days of notification of a pending
immobilization under subsection H2 of this section, or within ten (10) business
days after an immobilization or impoundment, the owner or operator of a vehicle
which is the subject of the notice or the action may file a written petition to
challenge the notice or action in city court or municipal court.
      2.   Upon receipt of a petition, the city or municipal court has
jurisdiction and shall set the matter for hearing on an expedited schedule. The
court shall give at least forty eight (48) hours written notice of the hearing
date to the citing city employee or designated representative, the city
prosecutor's office, and the petitioner.
      3.   Upon filing the petition, if the petition is filed based upon the
notice, and an immobilization or impoundment action has not yet taken place,
then any future immobilization or impoundment will be stayed pending the
outcome of the hearing. An appropriate order shall issue from the court.
      4.   The court shall not require a response to the petition from the
city, but shall take testimony and examine the facts of the case, except that
the issues are limited to:
         a.   For Immobilization Under Subsection H Of This Section:
            (1)   Whether at the time of an immobilization the vehicle was
either the subject of three (3) or more unpaid violations of this article, an
owner of the vehicle has three (3) or more unpaid violations of this article as
determined by subsection H3 of this section and those violations were issued
for any vehicle the person currently owns or has owned, or the vehicle or owner
is the subject of an order of immobilization in the city court or municipal
court; and
            (2)   Whether a representative of the city had sent, prior to
immobilization, to the registered owner of the vehicle a written notice
complying with subsection H2 of this section.

an act of immobilization or towing as provided in under this chapter.
      5.   Based upon the issues in subsection K4 of this section the court
shall determine whether the petitioner is entitled to rescission of the notice
or action of immobilization or impoundment. If the petitioner is entitled to
rescission, then the court may order the city to pay or reimburse the fees for
immobilization or impoundment. If the petition is denied, then the petitioner
is subject to the action of immobilization or impoundment and must pay the
costs of such action, if taken, together with any costs associated with the
hearing should the court find the petition was without merit.
      6.   If the immobilization or impoundment was deemed justified by court,
the court shall forfeit the bond. Any fines or fees remaining in excess of the
amount of the bond posted shall be ordered by the court to be paid to the court
by the owner of the vehicle.

9-3-7 of this chapter where the user can demonstrate that:
      1.   It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause
pass-through or interference; and
      2.   A local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or interference,
as the case may be, was developed by the city for each pollutant in the
industrial user's discharge that caused pass-through or interference, and the
user was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and during
the pass- through or interference; or
      3.   If a local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or
interference, as the case may be, has not been developed for the pollutant that
caused the pass-through or interference, the industrial user's discharge
directly prior to and during the pass-through or interference did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user's prior
discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with the POTW's
NPDES permit requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable
requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal. (Ord. 2013-7, 8-5-2013)

POTW and the city within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset
(if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within 5 days):
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
   B.   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish
an affirmative defense for the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of
proof. (Ord. 2013-7, 8-5-2013)
9-3-17: BYPASS:
   A.   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections B and C of this section.
   B.   The industrial user shall provide notice of bypass, to the city, as
follows:
      1.   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the POTW, if possible at least ten (10) days
before the date of the bypass.
      2.   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within twenty
four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.
A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time
the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The city may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral
report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   C.   Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against
an industrial user for bypass, unless:
      1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage; and
      2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      3.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection B
of this section.
   D.   The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three (3)

designee shall revoke the industrial discharge permit for the remainder of its
term or suspend it for a shorter period based on the severity of the
disqualification, its effect on public health, safety and welfare, and the time
during which the disqualification can be remedied if at all.
   C.   No user will be permitted to discharge into the POTW any wastewater
which is in violation of this section. Any user may have their wastewater
service suspended or terminated by the city manager or his designee.
   D.   Any person notified of a revocation or suspension of such person's
wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of failure of the
person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall sever

10-1-3: GROWTH POLICY:
   Within the State of Montana, governing bodies must substantially comply with
their adopted Growth Policy when adopting and implementing regulations like
zoning and when considering proposed land uses. The state requires that the
Growth Policy address eight (8) subject areas, including Land Use. This Zoning
Ordinance document should be updated at regular intervals and assessed for
consistency with the most recently adopted Growth Policy. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-
2023)

   B.   Official Zoning Map: The Community Development Department shall be
responsible for all changes to the Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning
Maps shall be available in the City Office and shall bear a certificate with
the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, and the date of
adoption of this map.
      1.   No unauthorized person may alter or modify the Official Zoning Map.
      2.   The certificate should read as follows: “This is to certify that
this is an Official Zoning Map referred to in Section 10.01.05 of the Official
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Belgrade, Montana.”
      3.   If any changes to the map are made by amendment of this chapter in
accordance with Section 10.06.11 hereof, such changes shall be made to the
Official Zoning Map and signed, dated, and certified upon the map or upon the
material attached thereto.
      4.   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official
Zoning Maps which may from time to time be made or published, the Official
Zoning Maps kept in the City Office shall be the final authority as to the
current zoning status of land and water area, buildings, and other structures
in the City.
      5.   In the event that the Official Zoning Maps become damaged,
destroyed, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes
and additions thereto, the City Council may adopt and certify new Official
Zoning Maps. The new Official Zoning Maps may correct drafting or other errors
or omissions in the prior map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of
amending the original Official Zoning Maps or any subsequent amendment thereof.
      6.   Interpretation of Boundaries shall be interpreted as follows where
uncertainty exists:
         a.   When the zoning map shows a zoning district boundary as following
a particular feature, or reflects a clear intent that the boundary follows the
feature, the boundary will be construed as following that feature as it
actually exists.
         b.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map or where other
circumstances or controversy arises over district boundaries, the City Council
shall interpret the district boundary.
         c.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerline.
         d.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines;
         e.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall
be construed as following such city limits.
         f.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following railroad lines
shall be construed as following such railroad lines;
         g.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following centerline of
streams, rivers, canals, or ditches shall be construed as following such
centerline.
         h.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale on the
map. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-1-6: INTERPRETATION AND MEASUREMENTS:
   A.   Language: When used in this Ordinance, the following rules for words
must apply:
      1.   The words “shall”, “must”, “will”, “is to”, and “are to” are always
mandatory.
      2.   “Should” is not mandatory but is strongly recommended; and “may” is
permissive.
      3.   The present tense includes the past and future tenses; and the
future tense includes the present.
      4.   The singular number includes the plural number, and the plural the
singular, unless the natural construction of the word indicates otherwise.
      5.   The words “includes” and “including” must mean “including but not
limited to...”.
      6.   When used to describe the applicability of two or more requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance, the word “or” shall mean that compliance with any of
the series is sufficient, and the words “and” and “and/or” must mean that
compliance with all of the series is required.
      7.   The words “occupied” or “used” must be considered as though followed
by the words “or intended, arranged or designed to be used or occupied”.
      8.   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text
of this Zoning Ordinance and any caption or illustration, the text shall
control.
      9.   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between a
specific definition found elsewhere in this Ordinance and the definition found
in this chapter, the specific definition shall control.
      10.   Time Limits. Whenever a number of days is specified in the
Ordinance, or in any permit, condition of approval, or notice provided in
compliance with the Ordinance, the number of days must be constructed as
consecutive calendar days. A time limit shall extend to 5 p.m. on the following
working day where the last of the specified number of days falls on a weekend
or holiday.
      11.   Allowable Uses of Land. The Director has the authority to determine
similar uses beyond what is identified in Section 10-3.4. The Director may also
refer any issue of similar use to the City Council for their determination.
   B.   Front Street, Side Street, And Property Line Determinations: Front
streets, side streets, and property lines shall be interpreted as follows:
      1.   Where only one street abuts a lot, that street is considered a front
street.
      2.   For purpose of this provision, the front property line is the
property line that “faces” and is adjacent to the front street.
      3.   A lot with more than one street front must designate at least one
front street. A lot may have more than one front street. The Director will
determine which streets are front streets based on:
         a.   The street or streets with the highest classification;
         b.   The established orientation of the block;
         c.   The street or streets abutting the longest face of the block;
         d.   The street or streets parallel to an alley within the block;
         e.   The street that the lot takes its address from; and
         f.   The pedestrian orientation of adjacent or abutting development,
existing or proposed.
   C.   Measurement.
      1.   Measurement of Setbacks. The method of measuring setbacks is as
follows:
         a.   Unless otherwise described in this Ordinance, required setbacks
must be measured horizontally from the nearest point of the front, side, or
rear lot line to the nearest line of the structure, see
Figure 1  below.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2164.jpg]
Figure 1: Setback Measurement
   For an irregular shaped lot, required setbacks (e.g., front, side, rear
setbacks) shall be determined by the Review Authority. Examples of setbacks on
irregular shaped lots are illustrated in Figure 3 above.
         b.    In measuring a front or secondary front setback, the setback
must be measured as the perpendicular distance between the closest edge of
right-of way and the corner or face of structure closest to the street.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2168.jpg]
   Figure 2: Sample Setback Measurement Graphic
         c.   For lots fronting on a substandard street, the front and
secondary front setbacks must be measured from the edge of right-of-way, based
upon the City’s adopted street standards.
         d.    Through parcels must have a front setback on both opposing sides
of the parcel.

   Figure 4: Structure Height
   D.    Height Measurements.
      1.     Unless otherwise described in this Ordinance, the maximum
allowable height must be measured as the vertical distance from the average
elevation of the finished grade along the front of the building to the highest
point of the building structure (see
Figure 4 above).
         a.   Average elevation of the finished grade is determined by
calculating the average of the highest and lowest elevation along natural or
improved grade (whichever is more restrictive) along the front of the building
parallel to the front street setback line (see
Figure 3 above).
      2.   Flagpoles must be consistent with the height limit in the respective
zoning district.
      3.   Agricultural structures and steeples attached to a place of worship
are exempt from height maximum standards. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023; amd. Ord.
2023-9, 12-18-2023)

ARTICLE I: USES IN GENERAL
10-3-1: USE TABLE:
   Principle uses are allowed as specified in 10-3-4. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-3-2: INTERPRETING USE TABLE:
   A.   Use Classification System.
      1.   Use Classification System Uses are listed in the first column of
Table 10-3-4. This zoning ordinance classifies uses into categories and
subcategories, as explained in (B). In some cases, specific use types are
listed in addition to the use categories and subcategories.
   B.   Permitted Uses.
      1.   Uses identified with a “P” are permitted as-of-right in the subject
zoning district, subject to compliance with any supplemental regulations
identified in the final column of
Table 10-3-4 and with all other applicable regulations of this zoning
ordinance.
      2.   Uses identified with a “P2” are permitted as-of-right in the subject
zoning district but only above the ground floor. Such uses are prohibited on
the ground floor.
   C.   Conditional Uses.
      1.   Conditional Uses identified with “C” are allowed only if reviewed
and approved as specified in
10-6-12 and subject to compliance with any supplemental regulations identified
in the final column of
Table 10-3-4, and with all other applicable regulations of this zoning
ordinance.
   D.   Prohibited Use.
   1.   Uses identified with an “-” are expressly prohibited. Uses that are not
listed in the table and that cannot be reasonably interpreted as specified in
10-3-3.E. to fall within any defined use category or subcategory are also
prohibited.
   E.   Reference.
      1.   The final (“Reference”) column of
Table 10-3-4 includes a cross-reference to the use definition and any
applicable supplemental use regulations that apply to the use. Unless otherwise
expressly stated, compliance with supplemental use regulations is required
regardless of whether the use is permitted as-of-right or requires conditional
use approval.
   F.   Accessory Uses.
      1.   
Table 10-3-4 identifies some types of accessory uses allowed in conjunction
with principal uses. Other types of accessory uses may be allowed in
conjunction with principal uses permitted by right or by conditional use
approval. Accessory uses are subject to compliance with all applicable
accessory use regulations as specified in
Article IX of this Title. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-3-3: CLASSIFICATION OF USES:
   A.   General:
      1.   This section describes the system used to classify principal uses in
this zoning ordinance.
   B.   Use Categories:
      1.   This zoning ordinance classifies principal land uses into ten (10)
major groupings. These major groupings are referred to as “use categories.” The
use categories are as follows:
         a.   Residential (see
Article II)
         b.   Commercial (see
Article III)
         c.   Industrial/Agricultural (see
Article IV)
         d.   Health And Wellness (see
Article V)
         e.   Public Uses (see
Article VI)
         f.   Recreation (see
Article VII)
         g.   Education And Childcare (see
Article VIII)
         h.   Accessory (see
Article IX)
         i.   Temporary (see
Article X)
         j.   Other (see
Article XI)
   C.   Use Subcategories:
      1.   Each use category is further divided into more specific
“subcategories.” Use subcategories to classify principal land uses and
activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics,
such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents,
how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions.
   D.   Specific Use Types:
      1.   Some use subcategories are further broken down to identify specific
types of uses that are regulated differently than the subcategory.
   E.   Classification Of Uses:
      1.   The community development director is authorized to classify uses on
the basis of the use category, subcategory, and specific use type descriptions
of this article.
      2.   When a use cannot be reasonably classified into a use category,
subcategory, or specific use type or appears to fit into multiple categories,
subcategories, or specific use types, the community development directors is
authorized to determine the most similar and, thus, most appropriate use
category, subcategory or specific use type based on the actual or projected
characteristics of the principal use or activity in relation to the use
category, subcategory, and specific use type descriptions provided in this
article. In making such determinations, the community development director must
consider the following:
         a.   The types of activities that typically occur in conjunction with
the use;
         b.   The types of equipment and processes to be used;
         c.   The existence, number, and frequency of residents, customers, or
employees;
         d.   The type of building or structure (if any) in which the use is
located;
         e.   Parking demands or the use; and
         f.   Other factors deemed relevant to a use determination.
         g.   If a use can reasonably be classified in multiple categories,
subcategories, or specific use types, the community development director is
authorized to categorize each use in the category, subcategory, or specific use
type that provides the most exact, narrowest, and appropriate “fit.”
   F.   If a use can reasonably be classified in multiple categories,
subcategories, or specific use types, the community development director is
authorized to categorize each use in the category, subcategory, or specific use
type that provides the most exact, narrowest, and appropriate “fit.” (Ord.

agent with which the resources shall be deposited.
         h.   An agreement between the applicant and the city whereby:
            (1)   The financial resources for decommissioning shall be in the
form of a surety bond or letter of credit and shall be deposited in an escrow
account with an escrow agent acceptable to the city.
            (2)   The city shall have access to the escrow account funds for
the expressed purpose of completing decommissioning if decommissioning is not
completed by the applicant within one year of the end of project life,
inoperability of individual WECS turbine, or facility abandonment. Escrow funds
may be used for administrative fees and costs associated with decommissioning.

      3.   Trees shall be provided at a rate of one per 40 feet of street
frontage.
      4.   Tree plantings shall be native to Gallatin County, Montana.
      5.   Street tree plantings shall be clearly indicated on the landscape
plan.
   G.   Buffer Yard Standards:
      1.   Applicability: Buffer yards shall be required between adjoining
incompatible uses as outlined in
Table 10-4-3.G.1, except for:
         a.   Any area occupied by structures, paving, walkways, decks, or
patios;
         b.   Any portion of a lot that retains a mature tree canopy that is
undisturbed from construction or site improvement activities, as determined by
the community development department;
         c.   Where landscaping would conflict with access to utility
infrastructure; however, groundcover shall be planted provided it does not
interfere with utility infrastructure as determined by the City Engineer;
         d.   Between adjacent sites with shared parking;
         e.   Where common driveways or vehicular access easements are located
on the property line; or
         f.   Where buildings are located side-by-side or on a property line.
      2.   Location:
         a.   Buffer yards shall be located on the side and rear lot lines
extending into the yard or setback, depending on the size of the lot. Buffers
shall not extend into, or be located within, any portion of an existing public
right-of-way.
         b.   The buffer yards specified shall be provided on each lot
independent of adjoining buffers.
   H.   Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements:
      1.   All surface, off-street parking lots shall comply with the
requirements of this section.
      2.   The minimum number of trees shall be at least one per 100 square
feet of landscaped parking lot area. Trees that are part of a buffer yard shall
not count toward meeting this minimum.
      3.   Whenever possible, parking lots larger than 30,000 square feet shall
be designed to break up their visual expanse and create the appearance of
smaller parking lots. This distinction or separation can be achieved by
interspersing yard space and buildings in strategic areas and taking advantage
of natural features such as slopes, existing woodland or vegetation, drainage
courses, and retention areas.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2383.jpg]
Diagram A
   B.   For signs consisting of free standing letters or features attached to a
wall, the sign area is calculated as the smallest rectangle encapsulating all
letters and symbols. Sign area does not include any supporting framework or
bracing unless such framework or bracing is part of the message or sign face
(see
diagram “B”).

Diagram B
   C.   For signs that are abnormal shapes, window signs, including neon window
signs, the total sign area is measured by multiplying the full width of the
overall sign copy, including the lettering, logo, and graphics, by the overall
height of the sign copy in a rectangular manner, regardless of the arrangement
of the copy (see
diagram “C”)

   D.   When two sign faces are placed back-to-back so that both faces cannot
be viewed from any one point at the same time and part of the same sign
structure, and are not more than 24 inches at its furthest distance apart, the
sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. (Ord. 2023-

the sign’s installation.
   B.   A sign shall lose its legal nonconforming status and must be brought
into compliance with the provisions of this chapter by an application for and
issuance of a zoning permit or by complete removal, if any of the following

nonconformity status as specified in this section shall cause the sign to be
considered an illegal sign.
      6.   Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs, such as
repainting, electrical repairs and neon tubing repairs shall be permitted.
Maintenance does not include making changes in the words, symbols, or design on
the current sign unless the words and symbols are part of the changeable reader
board or removable panels on a sign cabinet.
      7.   Sign face changes where there is no change to the nonconforming sign
structure including change in sign face area, height, or alteration of the sign
cabinet, if applicable, may be made without a zoning permit and without losing
the legal nonconforming status of the sign. These actions include, but are not
limited to, replacement of a sign face, repainting of a sign face, etc. (Ord.

2023-9, 12-18-2023)
10-6-5: SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR USES:
   A.   Purpose: Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or
provided for in this zoning ordinance, the Community Development Director may
make a determination that the proposed use is substantially similar to a
specific use that is listed or provided for in this zoning ordinance. If the
community development director finds that the use is substantially similar to a
specific use listed in this zoning ordinance, the substantially similar use is
deemed to be a substantially similar permitted use in those districts where the
specific use is permitted, and a substantially similar use special permit can
be approved in those districts where the specific use is specially permitted.
      1.   In determining that a proposed use is a substantially similar use,
the community development director shall follow the procedures relating to
appeals and variances as specified in this chapter. Upon making a determination
that a proposed use is substantially similar, the community development
director shall notify the city council of the decision and shall include
written findings justifying the reasoning upon which the decision is based.
   B.   Remedy By Application For Amendment: If the community development
director determines that a proposed use is not substantially similar, such a
determination may be appealed to the board of adjustments. Should the board of
adjustments also determine that the use is not substantially similar, the
appellant may seek a remedy by applying an amendment as specified in
10-6-10.
   C.   Standards For Consideration Of Substantially Similar Uses: The
following standards shall be considered by the community development director
(or, where there is an appeal of the community development director’s
determination, the board of adjustments) when making a determination that a use
is substantially similar to a permitted or a conditional use within a specific
district:
      1.   The compatibility of the proposed use with the general use
classification system as specified in this Zoning ordinance.
      2.   The nature, predominant characteristics, and intensity of the
proposed use in relation to those uses specified by this Zoning ordinance as
permitted, or in the case of a special permit use, specially permitted, in that
district.
      3.   The size, dimensional requirements, parking requirements, traffic
generation potential, and other regulatory considerations normally associated
with uses as specified in this Zoning Code.
   D.   Effect Of Determination That A Use Is Substantially Similar: Should a
use be determined to be substantially similar to a specific permitted or
specially permitted use provided for in this zoning ordinance, it shall then be
permitted in the same manner and under the same conditions and procedures as
the use is permitted to which it has been found to be substantially similar.
   E.   Record Of Substantially Similar Uses: The community development
director shall maintain as a public record a listing of all uses which have
been determined to be substantially similar. For each such use, the record
shall include the use as listed in the zoning ordinance; the use unlisted in
the zoning ordinance about which the determination of substantial similarity
was made, and the dates of any actions thereupon by the board of adjustment or
city council. This record shall also contain the same information for all uses
determined not to be substantially similar. The community development director
or their designee shall consult this record in issuing future permits. (Ord.

(Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-6-12:CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Purpose: This ordinance identifies certain uses that, because of their
unique or widely varying characteristics or their potential adverse impacts on
adjacent land uses, are not permitted as a matter of right, but that may be
approved through case-by-case review as a “conditional use.” They are subject
to conditional use regulations because they may, but do not necessarily, have
significant adverse effects on the environment, overburden public services,
change the desired character of an area, or create major nuisances. A review of
these uses is necessary due to their potential individual or cumulative impacts
on the surrounding area or neighborhood. The conditional use review provides an
opportunity to allow the use when there are minimal impacts, to allow the use
but impose mitigation measures to address specific reasonable concerns, or to
deny the use if the concerns cannot be resolved.
   B.   Authority To Initiate: Applications for approval of a conditional use
may be initiated by the common council for filed by an eligible applicant’s
authorized agent.
   C.   Pre-Application Meeting: Before filing a conditional use application,
the applicant or the authorized agent must meet with the planning staff to
discuss the proposed amendment and the applicable procedures. Staff will
determine whether the conditional use is a minor or a standard use at this pre-
application meeting.
   D.   Application Filing:
      1.   Shall be filed in accordance with the procedures in this Chapter;
      2.   Shall be filed with the City on forms provided by the Community
Development Department;
      3.   Shall include all required supplemental information;
      4.   Shall be submitted by the application deadline as established by the
City;
      5.   Shall be signed by the applicant and owner attesting to the truth
and exactness of all information supplied on the application; and
      6.   Public notice requirements must be met by applicant.
   E.   Transmittal: The application shall be transmitted to City Engineer,
Police Department, and Fire Department to review and provide comments. The
application and comments from each Department shall be transmitted to planning
staff to include in staff recommendations.
   F.   Conditional Uses-Minor Approval: The planning staff must review the
proposed conditional use and comments from other departments and provide
recommendations to the City Manager. The City Manager will either approve the
application or approve with modification with appropriate conditions and
safeguards, as specified in Section
10-6-12.H, in conformity with the zoning ordinance. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this zoning
ordinance and punishable specified in
10-6-21.
   G.   Conditional Uses-Standard Approval: The planning staff must review the
proposed conditions use and prepare a recommendation for consideration by the
planning board and common council.
      1.   Public Hearing Planning Board: There shall be a hearing for each
conditional use application. Said hearing shall be held at an appointed time
and place within forty-five (45) days of the date of application. The board
shall take testimony from persons interested in said application. Public Notice
shall follow the procedures specified in section
10-6-20.
      2.   Recommendations by Planning Board:
         a.   Within thirty-five (35) days after the conclusion of the public
hearing, the planning board shall either recommend approval with or without
supplementary conditions as specified in
10-6-12.H, or denial to the City Council.
         b.   The public hearing may be extended to another date by mutual
agreement of the Planning Commission and the applicant.
      3.   Public Hearing City Council: Upon receipt of the planning board
recommendation, the city council will hold a public hearing on the said
application, at which the planning board recommendation will be read, and
additional testimony may be taken from interested parties. Notice shall follow
the procedures specified in
10-6-20.
      4.   Approval by City Council: Conditional Use Permits shall be issued
upon authorization by the city council, after review by the planning board, and
shall be based on a determination that the land use or activity complies with
specific requirements for certain land uses and activities as may be outlined
in this chapter.
         a.   If the application is approved or approved with modification, the
City Council shall direct the community development director to issue a
conditional use permit listing the specific conditions specified by the
planning board for approval. If the application is denied by the city council
the applicant may appeal the decision through the board of adjustment in
accordance with the procedures specified in
10-6-16.
         b.   Expiration. City Council shall determine if the use stays for the
life of the property or ceases if the conditional use shall cease for more than
a period of time.
   H.   Supplementary Conditions And Safeguards:
      1.   Those land uses or activities outlined in this chapter as requiring
a Conditional Use Permit are considered to be sufficiently distinctive in terms
of their nature, location, and impact on the surrounding area to warrant
special evaluation of each case. The City’s decision to approve or deny a
Conditional Use Permit must be supported by the following standards and shall
find evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
         a.   Is in fact, a conditional use as established under the provisions
of
Chapter 3 and appears in
Chapter 3 for the applicable zoning district;
         b.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives or with any specific objective of the City’s recently adopted Growth
Policy, Area Specific Plans, and/or the zoning ordinance;
         c.   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
         d.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
         e.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police, and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to provide adequately any such services;
         f.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
         g.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment, and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons,
property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes or odors;
         h.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property, which shall be so
designed as not to interfere with traffic on surrounding public thoroughfares.
      2.   In recommending any conditional use, the community development
director or planning board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards
in conformity with this zoning ordinance. Violations of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is
granted, shall be deemed a violation of this zoning ordinance and punishable
specified in
10-6-21. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-6-13: SIGN PERMIT REQUIRED:
   A.   Permits Required: Applications for sign permits must be filed with the

installation of a sign that encroaches upon or over the right-of-way, a such
permit application must also include the following information:
      1.   The location of encroachment identified in drawings/renderings is
required under paragraph (A).
      2.   Acknowledgment by the property and business owner that the city may
revoke permission to encroach upon right-of-way based on public safety,
maintenance, other use, or other legitimate reasons;
      3.   Property owner agrees to hold the city harmless from any and all
injury that may occur to any party resulting from using the right-of-way. This
provision is intended to indemnify and hold harmless the city to the fullest
extent permitted by law. It includes the payment of reasonable attorney fees
for the defense of any claims brought that can fairly be said to be under the
intent and purpose of this hold harmless agreement. To secure such hold
harmless agreement, the property or business owner must maintain a general
liability insurance policy on its business operations in an amount of not less
than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and produce a certificate of insurance
demonstrating to the satisfaction of the city that the city is entitled to
coverage thereunder under the terms and conditions of the hod harmless
agreement. A copy of the certificate of insurance must be provided and
maintained or the permission to encroach on right-of-way will be revoked.
      4.   The authority to encroach upon right-of-way does not transfer to any
new business or property owner. A new right-of-way encroachment permit is
required.
   C.   Sign Permit Issuance And Denial:
      1.   The community development director must issue a permit for the
erection, structural alteration, enlargement, or relocation of a sign within
the city when the permit application is properly completed, all required fees
have been paid, and the sign complies with all applicable regulations. If the
sign permit is denied, the community development director must give written
notice of the denial to the applicant and property owner, with a brief
statement of the reasons for the denial. The community development director’s
failure to either formally grant or deny a properly completed sign permit
application within ten (10) days of the date of application meeting the
requirements of this article constitutes cause for an appeal to the planning
board.
   D.   Sign Permit Variance: If a sign permit is denied due to the regulations
of this article causing undue or unnecessary hardship on any person, firm, or
corporation, a variance from the sign regulations may be requested as specified
in
10-6-17.
   E.   Violations And Penalties: Violations of or failure to comply with this
chapter’s provisions are declared unlawful.
      1.   Any sign erected, altered, moved, or structurally modified without a
permit or altered with a permit but in violation of the provisions of this
chapter, must be removed at the owner’s expense or brought into compliance
within five (5) days of written notification by the community development
director. If the violation is failure to obtain a permit, a permit fee is
required, and the permit fee will be two (2) times the normal fee. If the owner
does not remove the sign or bring it into compliance, the community development
director may order removal, the expenses of which will be assessed to the tax
roll of the property on which the unlawful sign is located.
      2.   This section does not preclude the city from maintaining any
appropriate action to prevent or remove a violation of this article. If the
owner does not remove or bring it into compliance, the community development
director may order the sign removed. If such a sign is not removed by the owner
within the time period specified, the city may cause removal, with the owner
being responsible for all costs. These expenses will be assessed to the tax
roll of the property on which the unlawful sign is located. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-

solutions may result in equal or better implementation of the regulation’s
intended purpose and consistency with the Growth Policy, and Downtown Design
Plan.

application and plan, and the application must include a written statement
describing why the exception is necessary and all efforts to mitigate any
adverse impacts resulting from a grant of the exception.

planning staff is authorized to approve the following as minor design
exceptions based on consideration of the general intent statement of
10-6-19.B.

strict compliance with the Downtown Design Guidelines of Chapter 2 that are not
expressly authorized for processing as minor design exceptions and to hear and
decide appeals of the planning staff’s decision on any minor design exception.
      2.   The planning board’s decision to approve or deny a request for a
major design exception must be based on a determination of whether:
         a.   The requested design exception is consistent with the general
intent statement
10-6-19.B;
            (1)   The requested design exception is consistent with the Growth
Policy, the Downtown Design Plan, and any adopted area plan; and
            (2)   The requested design exception will not result in any adverse
impacts on other properties in the area beyond those impacts ordinarily

The regulations of this chapter govern nonconformities, which are lots, uses,
and structures that were lawfully established but, because of the adoption of
new or amended regulations, no longer comply with one or more provisions of
this zoning ordinance. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-7-2: PURPOSE:
   A.   Occasionally, lots, uses, and structures that were lawfully established
(i.e., in compliance with all regulations in effect at the time of their
establishment) are made nonconforming because of changes, in the zoning
regulations that apply to the subject property (e.g., through zoning map
changes or amendments to the text of the zoning ordinance). The regulations of
this article are intended to clarify the effect of this “nonconforming” status
and avoid confusion with “illegal” buildings and uses (i.e., those established
in violation of applicable zoning regulations). The regulations of this article
are also intended to:
      1.   Recognize the interests of landowners in continuing to use their
property for uses and activities that were lawfully established;
      2.   Promote maintenance, reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings;
      3.   Place reasonable limits on nonconformities that have the potential
to adversely affect surrounding properties. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-7-3: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
   A.   Smaller Than Required: In any district, notwithstanding other
limitations imposed by this title, structures permitted in said district may be
erected on any single lot of record on the effective date of this title. A lot
of record that does not meet lot area or lot width requirements must still meet
other requirements of the district. No variance shall be granted to facilitate
the erection, construction or establishment of any structure on a nonconforming
lot of record.
   B.   Larger Than Required: Where lots are larger than required by this
title, said lots may be divided, except no parcel may be divided so as to
create a lot smaller in lot width or lot area than required by this title.
(Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-7-4: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND:
   A.   Continued Use: Where, at the time of passage hereof, lawful use of land
exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this title,
the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
      1.   Increase Nonconformity: No such nonconforming structure may be
altered or enlarged in any way which increases its nonconformity, but any
structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      2.   Destruction: Should such a nonconforming structure or nonconforming
portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more than
fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
title.
         a.   Single-Family Residences in Commercial Districts may be expanded
or may be rebuilt even if destroyed beyond fifty percent (50%) of its
replacement costs only by issuance of a conditional permit; provided, that:
            (1)   The existing character of the area in which expansion is
requested is primarily of a residential character or nature; and
            (2)   The square footage of the requested expansion is not more
than fifty percent (50%) of the total square footage of the existing
nonconforming use or structure.
   B.   Lack Of Off-Street Parking Or Loading: For the purpose of this chapter,
the lack of required off-street parking as specified in
10-4-4 of this title as applied to the Downtown District shall not render
structures as nonconforming as of the passage hereof. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-7-5: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES:
   A.   Continued Use: If lawful use of a structure or of structures and
premises, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment hereof that
would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title, the lawful
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful; providing, that:
      1.   Enlarged, Extended, Constructed, Or Structurally Altered: No
existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, or structurally altered unless the use is changed to a permitted
use.
      2.   Extended To Another Part Of Building: Any nonconforming use may be
extended to any other part of a building designed for such use, but no such use
may be extended in any way to occupy land outside the building.
      3.   Superseded By Permitted Use: Any structure or structure and land, in
or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located,
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      4.   Cease In Use: Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure or
premises ceases for ninety (90) days, the structure or premises shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district
in which it is located. The term “ceases” as used in this subsection shall mean
that the activity in question has not been in operation for a period of ninety
(90) days.
      5.   Status Applies To Both Use And Land: Where nonconforming use status
applies to both structure and land, the removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
   B.   Lack Of Off-Street Parking Or Loading: For the purpose of this chapter,
the lack of required off-street parking as specified in
10-4-4 of this title as applied to the Downtown District shall not render
structures as nonconforming as of the passage hereof. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-7-6: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
On any nonconforming structure or portion of the structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs and fixtures, wiring,
plumbing, or repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, to an extent not
exceeding ten percent (10%) of the replacement value of the building in any one
year; provided, that such work does not increase the cubic content of the
building. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or portion thereof declared to
be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order
of such official. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)
10-7-7: CONDITIONAL USES:
Conditional uses provided for under
Chapter 6 of this title shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in the district
in which it is permitted. (Ord. 2023-7, 7-17-2023)

SUMMARY REVIEW PROCEDURES FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION:
11-4-1: General
11-4-2: First Minor Subdivision
11-4-3: Subsequent Minor Subdivisions
11-4-1: GENERAL:
Subdivisions containing five (5) or fewer lots in which proper access to all
lots is provided and in which no land is to be dedicated to public use for
parks and playgrounds, shall be reviewed under the procedures of this chapter.
(Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004)
11-4-2: FIRST MINOR SUBDIVISION:
For a first minor subdivision created from a tract of record, the requirements
for a public hearing and preparation of an environmental assessment do not
apply.
   A.   Time For Review: The council shall approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove the first minor subdivision from a tract of record within thirty
five (35) days of the submission of a completed application, unless the
subdivider consents, in writing, to an extension of the review period.
   B.   Presubmittal Meeting: To provide assistance in the minor subdivision
review process, the planning department is available to meet with the
subdivider prior to submitting a subdivision application. The purpose of this
meeting is to discuss the regulations and design standards; familiarize the
subdivider with the subdivision review process; identify goals and objectives
of applicable plans, regulations, and ordinances; and discuss the proposed
subdivision as it relates to these matters. If necessary, the planning
department will assist the subdivider in obtaining copies of available surveys
and/or plats from the clerk and recorder's office.
   C.   Preapplication Plan: It is highly recommended that prior to submittal
of a preliminary plat, the subdivider submit an application for preapplication
review. The application for preapplication review should provide all of the
information as set forth in these regulations. Six (6) copies of the
preapplication materials should be submitted. The planning department shall
review the preapplication plan and, within fifteen (15) working days, advise
the subdivider as to whether the plans and data meet the goals and objectives
of applicable city approved plans and these regulations.
   D.   Application: The subdivider shall submit an application for minor
subdivision review, the appropriate fee, and all required preliminary
information as set forth in these regulations. Fifteen (15) copies of the
application materials are required.
   E.   Submittal:
      1.   Determination Of Completeness: All minor subdivision applications
should be submitted to the planning department at least eighteen (18) days
prior to the next regular planning board meeting. The planning department shall
review the application within three (3) working days to determine if it is
complete. The review period will begin on the date that the planning department
determines the application is complete. The application shall be heard by the
planning board at its next regular meeting following the determination of the
completeness of the application. If the application is determined to be
incomplete, the application, review fee and a written deficiency notice will be
returned to the subdivider.
      2.   Planning Board Review: The planning board shall review the proposed
subdivision.
         a.   The planning board shall consider whether the preliminary plat
conforms to the provisions of: (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004)
            (1)   Any officially adopted growth policy for the area involved.
(Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004; amd. 2009 Code)
            (2)   Applicable zoning regulations.
            (3)   The Montana subdivision and platting act.
            (4)   Subdivision regulations.
         b.   Within ten (10) days after the planning board review, the
planning board shall submit, in writing, to the council:
            (1)   Its advice regarding the items under subsection E2a of this
section.
            (2)   A recommendation for approval, conditional approval or
disapproval of the plat, or no official recommendation.
   F.   Approval: The council shall approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove the preliminary plat of a first minor subdivision within thirty five
(35) days of determination that the application is complete, unless there is a
written extension from the subdivider.
      1.   Basis For Decision: The basis for the council decision shall be
whether the preliminary plat, planning board advice and recommendation, and
additional information demonstrate that development of the subdivision meets
the requirements of the act. The council may not deny approval of a subdivision
based solely on the subdivision impacts on educational services.
      2.   Findings Of Fact:
         a.   Criteria Weighed: The council shall issue written findings of
fact that weigh the following criteria:
            (1)   The effect on agriculture, agricultural water user
facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife and wildlife
habitat, and public health and safety.
            (2)   Compliance with the survey requirements of the act.
            (3)   Compliance with these local subdivision regulations and the
review process of these regulations.
            (4)   The provision of easements for the location and installation
of any necessary utilities.
            (5)   The provision of legal and physical access to each parcel
within the subdivision and the required notation of that access on the
applicable plat and any instrument transferring the parcel.
         b.   Written Findings: The written findings of fact shall include:
            (1)   The reason for the denial or condition imposition.
            (2)   The evidence that justifies the denial or condition
imposition.

condition imposition.
      3.   Mitigation: The council may require the subdivider to design the
subdivision to reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts
identified through the review required by these regulations. The council shall
issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation required by these
regulations.
         a.   In reviewing a subdivision under this chapter and when requiring
mitigation under this subsection, the council may not unreasonably restrict a
landowner's ability to develop land, but it is recognized that in some
instances the unmitigated impacts of a proposed development may be unacceptable
and will preclude approval of the plat.
         b.   When requiring mitigation under this subsection, the council
shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration
to the expressed preference of the subdivider. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004)
      4.   Subdivision Proposed In Growth Policy Area: When a minor subdivision
is proposed in an area where a growth policy has been adopted pursuant to
Montana Code Annotated section 76-1-101, et seq., and the proposed subdivision
will comply with the master plan; the subdivision is exempt from the review
criteria contained in these regulations but is subject to applicable zoning
regulations. In order for a growth policy to serve as the basis for the
exemption provided in this subsection, the policy must, at a minimum, contain:
(Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004; amd. 2009 Code)
         a.   Housing, transportation, and land use elements sufficient for the
council to protect public health, safety and welfare.
         b.   A discussion of physical constraints on development that exist
within the area encompassed by the proposed subdivision.
   G.   Approval Period: Upon approving or conditionally approving a
preliminary plat, the council shall provide the subdivider with a dated and
signed statement of approval. This approval shall be in force for not more than
three (3) calendar years nor less than one calendar year. At the end of this
period, the council may, at the request of the subdivider, extend its approval
for no more than one calendar year, except that the council may extend its
approval for a period of more than one year if that approval period is included
as a specific condition of a written subdivision improvements agreement between
the council and the subdivider.
   H.   Additional Conditions After Approval: After the preliminary plat is
approved, the council may not impose any additional conditions as a
prerequisite to final plat approval, providing said approval is obtained within
the original or extended approval period as provided above.
At the request of the subdivider and with the concurrence of the subdivider,
the council may modify a condition of preliminary plat approval consistent with
these regulations at a regularly scheduled meeting of the council
   I.   Final Plat: The final plat shall follow the requirements of the major
subdivision section. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004)
11-4-3: SUBSEQUENT MINOR SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Requirements And Procedures: For second or subsequent minor
subdivisions from a tract of record, the requirements for a public hearing and
environmental assessment apply. The procedures of the major subdivision section
apply to a second or subsequent minor subdivision.
   B.   Time For Review: The council shall approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove the second or subsequent minor subdivision from a tract of record
within sixty (60) days of the submission of a completed application, unless the
subdivider consents, in writing, to an extension of the review period. (Ord.

with adopted growth policies, zoning ordinances and other resolutions and
regulations. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004; amd. 2009 Code)
   B.   General Design: The design and development of the subdivision shall
minimize adverse impacts to agriculture water conveyance facilities, local
services, the natural environment, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and public
health and safety. Where a subdivision is expected to have an adverse impact on
any of the above, the preliminary plat application shall describe such impacts
and propose mitigation. (Ord. 2011-2, 5-16-2011)
   C.   Lands Unsuitable For Subdivision: Land which the council has found to
be unsuitable for subdivision because of potential hazards such as flooding,
landslides, excessive slopes, rockfalls, snow avalanches, subsidence, high
water tables, polluted or nonpotable water; or because of unreasonable burdens
on the general public such as requirements for the excessive expenditure of
public funds, environmental degradation, and congestion in the roads, shall not
be subdivided for building or residential purposes unless the hazards or
excessive public burdens are eliminated or will be overcome by appropriate
design and construction plans.
   D.   Revegetation: All areas disturbed during construction shall be reseeded
with vegetation types approved by the weed control supervisor.
   E.   Watercourse Mitigation: Where a subdivision is crossed by or adjacent
to a watercourse, the subdivider shall mitigate the impacts of the subdivision
on the watercourse. This mitigation may not be less restrictive than the
requirements of any applicable floodplain regulations or applicable zoning
regulations.
      1.   Setback: The subdivider shall provide the following setbacks, which
parallel the ordinary high water mark of the watercourse. A one hundred foot
(100') setback shall be provided between the ordinary high water mark and any
residential or commercial structure.
      2.   Watercourse Mitigation Plan: The subdivider shall submit a plan and
propose measures to mitigate the impacts of the subdivision on the watercourse.

the watercourse; to include consideration of wildlife and fish habitat, water
quality, vegetation, and watercourse health. The mitigation measures might
include setbacks, building envelopes, landscaping, type and/or location of
septic systems, streambank stabilization, etc. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004)
   F.   Mitigation Of Impacts On Water Conveyance Facilities:
      1.   Mitigation Of Adverse Impacts: Where a water conveyance facility is
located on or adjacent to property proposed for subdivision, the subdivider
shall mitigate adverse impacts of the subdivision on the water conveyance
facility. Mitigation shall include the requirements of subsection F1a or F1b of
this section, and any other methodology necessary to mitigate adverse impacts
on the water conveyance facility. Mitigation shall be reasonable, based on site
specific conditions, and shall address any comments received from the water
users and/or water conveyance facility's authorized representatives.
         a.   Establishment of water conveyance facility noninterference
setbacks as described in subsection F2 of this section is required in the event
water conveyance facilities exist or will be established on the property being
subdivided and such facilities convey water through the property being
subdivided to lands adjacent to or beyond the subdivision. Water conveyance
facility noninterference setbacks may also be required on the property being
subdivided when a water conveyance facility is located on land adjacent to the
proposed subdivision.
         b.   Establishment of water conveyance facility easements as described
in subsection
11-6-4C of this chapter is required in the event water conveyance facilities
exist or will be established on the property being subdivided and such
facilities provide water for use on land within the subdivision, and do not
convey water through the property being subdivided to lands adjacent to or
beyond the subdivision.
      2.   Water Conveyance Facility Noninterference Setbacks:
         a.   The preliminary and final plats shall show the water conveyance
facility noninterference setback as set forth in subsection F1 of this section.
This setback shall be reasonable and of sufficient width to provide for the
unobstructed passage and delivery of water, unobstructed access, inspection,
use, routine maintenance, repair, and construction related to the water
conveyance facility, and shall be based on site specific conditions and shall
address comments from the water users and/or water conveyance facility's
authorized representatives. This setback shall extend on both sides of the
water conveyance facility and shall be measured from the centerline along a
horizontal plane.
         b.   To assure noninterference with water conveyance facilities, no
livestock grazing shall take place, nor shall any new structures (other than
structures for the maintenance and operation of the water conveyance facility),
fences, landscaping (other than grass), or roads be installed, or erected
within the water conveyance facility noninterference setback, except where
agreed to in writing by the water users and/or water conveyance facility's
authorized representatives.
      3.   Disagreement With Mitigation Requested Or Comments Not Received:
Where the subdivider has not received comments from the water users or water
conveyance facility's authorized representatives, or where the subdivider is
not in agreement with the mitigation requested by water users or water
conveyance facility's authorized representatives, the following shall take
place:
         a.   The preliminary plat shall show a default fifty foot (50') water
conveyance facility noninterference setback as described in subsection F2a of
this section, or required water conveyance facility easements as described in
subsection
11-6-4C of this chapter; and
         b.   If the subdivider, water users, or water conveyance facility's
authorized representatives are of the opinion that, based on site specific
conditions, the water conveyance facility noninterference setback should be
different than the default setback, a written request justifying the proposed
alternate setback shall be submitted with the preliminary plat application, and
a copy of the written request shall be sent to the other applicable parties;
and
         c.   At the hearing on the preliminary plat application, the city
council:
            (1)   Shall consider the site specific conditions and any
information entered into the record regarding the water conveyance facility;
            (2)   May impose conditions of preliminary plat approval as
necessary to adequately mitigate adverse impacts on the subject water
conveyance facility; and
            (3)   May require the width of the water conveyance facility
noninterference setback to be greater than or less than the default width if
site specific conditions so warrant.
      4.   Written Agreement: Any mitigation of water conveyance facilities
required as a condition of preliminary plat approval shall be agreed to in
writing by the subdivider prior to issuance of final plat approval. Such
written agreement shall be filed with the Gallatin County clerk and recorder
when the final plat is recorded and shall include language to assure the
mitigation requirements are binding upon all successors in interest and remain
in effect until such time that the water conveyance facility is abandoned in
accordance with the requirements of Montana law or alternative requirements are
agreed to in writing by all applicable parties.
      5.   Secondary Easement: Water conveyance facility noninterference
setbacks do not eliminate any secondary easement for maintenance and repair of
the water conveyance facility as described by section 70-17-112, Montana Code
Annotated. Subdividers shall consider the specific terms and requirements of
any such secondary easement(s) when designing a subdivision to ensure a
buildable location on each developable lot.
      6.   Written Permission: Before any maintenance, improvements, or
modifications are performed on any water conveyance facility, written
permission must be obtained from the water users and/or water conveyance
facility's authorized representatives. (Ord. 2011-2, 5-16-2011)

be permitted only when the subdivider can demonstrate that the proposed lot
designs are necessary due to topography or other physical constraints. Each lot
shall contain a satisfactory building site and shall conform to zoning codes
and growth policies where officially adopted, and to the regulations of MDEQ.
Slopes in excess of twenty five percent (25%) shall be presumed unsuitable for
building sites unless otherwise proved by the subdivider. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-
2004; amd. 2009 Code)
   B.   Division By Rights Of Way: No single lot shall be divided by a
dedicated right of way or easement which would reduce the buildable area to a
size less than required by these and other adopted regulations.
   C.   Double Frontage: Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where
essential to:
      1.   Provide separation of residential development from arterial roads.
      2.   Provide access to development adjacent to limited access roads.
      3.   Overcome topography or other physical conditions.
      4.   Overcome specific disadvantages of existing design and orientation.
   D.   Corner Lots: Corner lots shall have sufficient width to permit
appropriate building setback from both roads and provide acceptable visibility
for traffic safety.
   E.   Width: Lots shall have a width sufficient to allow normal construction
without the construction encroaching on property lines.
   F.   Depth: No lot shall have an average depth greater than three (3) times
its average width.

Underground utilities, if placed in the road right of way, shall be located
between the roadway and the right of way line to simplify location and repair
of lines. Such underground facilities shall be installed or utility culverts
provided before the road is surfaced to eliminate the necessity of disturbing
the road surface when connecting individual services. Overhead utility lines
shall be located at the rear property lines where practical. Utility facilities
shall be designed by utility firms in cooperation with the subdivider, subject,
however, to all applicable laws and rules and regulations of any appropriate
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such facilities. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-
5-2004)

11-7-1: GENERAL DESIGN:
   A.   Roads: The arrangement, type, extent, width, grade, and location of all
roads shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned roads,
topographical conditions, public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such roads.
   B.   Relation To Unsubdivided Areas:
      1.   When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land and access to the
unsubdivided land must pass through the new subdivision, the subdivider shall
provide rights of way and construct roads so as to allow suitable access to the
unsubdivided land.
      2.   This requirement may be waived by the public works department if one
of the following criteria is met:
         a.   Topography or other physical condition would make it
impracticable to provide access to adjacent unsubdivided property.
         b.   Adequate public access is otherwise available to the adjacent
unsubdivided property.
         c.   When the adjoining unsubdivided property is under a conservation
easement, public ownership, or other legally restrictive covenants.
      3.   The public works department must review and approve all proposed
waivers.
   C.   Relation To Subdivided Areas: The subdivider shall arrange the roads to
provide for the continuation of roads between adjacent subdivided properties
when such continuation is necessary for the convenient movement of traffic,
effective provision of emergency services, and efficient provision of
utilities.
   D.   Separation Of Through And Local Traffic: Where a subdivision abuts or
contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector road, the subdivider may
be required to provide frontage roads, reverse frontage with a reservation
prohibiting access along the rear property line, screen planting, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
   E.   Distance Between Parallel Rights Of Way: Where a subdivision borders on
or contains a railroad, limited access highway, canal, ditch, or stream right
of way, the subdivider may be required to provide a road approximately parallel
to and on each side of such right of way at a distance suitable to allow for
the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future
grade separation.
   F.   Dead End Roads:
      1.   No dead end roads shall be permitted without an approved turn
around. Where streets terminate, the subdivider shall provide either a cul-de-
sac or "T" turnaround at the terminus. Cul-de- sacs and "T" turnarounds must
conform to the design specification of section
11-7-9, table 1 of this chapter. Where it is planned that a dead end road will

11-10-1: USE RESTRICTED:
Land subject to being flooded by a "flood of 100-year frequency" as defined by
Montana Code Annotated title 76, chapter 5, or land deemed to be subject to
flooding by the council, shall not be subdivided for building or residential
purposes, or other uses that may increase or aggravate flood hazards to life,
health or welfare, or that may be prohibited by state or local floodplain or
floodway regulations. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004)
11-10-2: PROCEDURE:
   A.   Evaluation Required: If any portion of a proposed subdivision is within
two thousand (2,000) horizontal feet and less than twenty (20) vertical feet of
a watercourse draining an area of twenty five (25) square miles or more, and no
official floodplain or floodway delineation (study) of the stream has been
made, the subdivider shall provide, in detail, the calculated 100-year
frequency water surface elevations and/or 100-year floodplain boundaries. This
detailed information shall be performed by a licensed professional engineer
experienced in this field of work.
   B.   Submission Of Report: This information shall be submitted at the time
of preliminary plat application. This information may be submitted, upon the
request of the commission, to the floodplain management section, water
resources division, department of natural resources and conservation (DNRC) for
review and concurrence.

hydraulic characteristics of the floodplain (e.g., points where ground cover,
soil, or rock conditions change). Elevations must be reported in NAVD 88 or
NGVD 29 datum.
         b.   Each cross section shall cross the entire floodplain. The cross
section alignment should be perpendicular to the general flow of the
watercourse (approximately perpendicular to contour line). Occasionally, wide
floodplains require a dogleg alignment to be perpendicular to the anticipated
flow lines. Shots should be taken at the water's edge and measurement taken (if
elevation shots cannot be taken) to determine the channel bottom shape. Cross
sections shall be accurately located on a USGS seven and one-half (71/2) minute
quad sheet.
         c.   The number of cross sections needed and the distance between
cross sections will vary depending on the site, the slope of the watercourse,
the slope of the channel, and the hydraulic characteristics of the reach. A
minimum of four (4) cross sections are required over the entire reach with at
least two (2) cross sections at the property where the elevations are desired.
Additional cross sections must be taken at bridges, control structures, or
natural constrictions in topography.
      5.   Bridges: Descriptions and sketches of all bridges within the reach,

Montana Code Annotated section 76-3-101 et seq.
   B.   The following procedures, criteria and requirements shall be used to
review an exemption from subdivision review and to determine whether the
division of land is for the purpose of evading the act. (Ord. 2004-1, 4-5-2004)

these regulations shall submit a claim on the appropriate application form,
including a signed certificate of exemption, together with evidence to support
the claim and any other information required by these regulations to the
planning department. Four (4) paper copies of the certificate of survey shall

this title, the presumption may be overcome by the claimant with evidence
contrary to the presumption. If the city concludes that the evidence overcomes
the presumption and that, from all the circumstances, the exemption is
justified, the city will allow the exemption. On the other hand, if the city
concludes that the presumption is not overcome and, that from all the
circumstances, the exemption is not justified, the city will disallow the
exemption.

provide written notification of its decision to the person claiming the
exemption and the clerk and recorder.
   J.   Certificate Of Survey: A certificate of survey of a division of land
which is exempted from review may not be filed by the clerk and recorder unless

less than one hundred sixty (160) acres.

security for construction mortgages, liens, or trust indentures, when a survey
of the parcel has been required.

      2.   The financing is for construction on land other than on the exempted
parcel.
   C.   Additional Documents Required: When the security for construction
financing exemption is to be used, the landowner shall submit, in addition to
such other documents as may be required, a written statement explaining:

11-16-1: INTENT:
The following conditions and covenants are commonly required as part of the
subdivision review and approval process in the city of Belgrade. The primary
purpose of this chapter is to give applicants an idea of some of the conditions
and covenants that may be attached to the approval of their project. While the
planning department attempts to utilize standard conditions, please be aware
that these conditions and covenants are likely to change as the subdivision
review process evolves, and as site specific conditions may warrant. (Ord.
2011-2, 5-16-2011)
11-16-2: WATER CONVEYANCE FACILITIES:
   A.   Conditions Related To Water Conveyance Facilities:
      1.   Water conveyance facilities and the required water conveyance
facility noninterference setback shall be shown on the final plat and clearly
labeled. Plats shall depict irrigation ditches, canals, or pipelines by their
centerline.
      2.   The following note shall appear on the final subdivision plat:

subdivision plat does not eliminate any secondary easement described by Section
70-17-112, MCA.
      3.   Unless there is written consent from the appropriate water users
and/or water conveyance facility's authorized representatives, stormwater,
snowmelt runoff, water from dewatering practices, or other water originating
from within the boundaries of the subdivision shall not discharge into or
otherwise be directed into any irrigation ditch, canal, pipeline, or other
water conveyance facility.
      4.   The subdivider shall not undertake any activity that would result in
the interference or obstruction in the transmission of water in any water
conveyance facility. Before any maintenance, improvements, or modifications are
performed on any water conveyance facility, written permission must be obtained
from the water users and/or water conveyance facility's authorized
representatives. Upon completion of maintenance, improvements, or modifications
to any water conveyance facility, the subdivider shall provide written notice
to the water users and/or water conveyance facility's authorized
representatives and allow them an opportunity to inspect such work.
   B.   Covenants Related To Water Conveyance Facilities:
      1.   No water may be removed from any irrigation ditch, canal, or other
water conveyance facility without a water right, permit, or written water lease
agreement with the appropriate water users and/or water conveyance facility's
authorized representatives.
      2.   Unless there is written consent from the appropriate water users
and/or water conveyance facility's authorized representatives, stormwater,
snowmelt runoff, water from dewatering practices, or other water originating
from within the boundaries of the subdivision shall not discharge into or
otherwise be directed into any irrigation ditch, canal, pipeline, or other
water conveyance facility.
      3.   The owners' association shall remove any trash or debris that
originated from within the subdivision and has accumulated in the water

FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
CHAPTER 1
TITLE AND PURPOSE
SECTION:
12-1-1: Title
12-1-2: Findings
12-1-3: Purpose
12-1-1: TITLE:
These regulations shall be known and cited as CITY OF BELGRADE FLOODPLAIN
REGULATIONS. These regulations are promulgated under the authority of the laws
of the state of Montana and relevant federal law. Authorization for these
regulations is contained in the floodplain and floodway management act, title
76, chapter 5 Montana Code Annotated. Flood hazard areas specifically adopted
herein have been delineated and designated by the DNRC or FEMA pursuant to 76-
5-201 Montana Code Annotated. Other authority for municipalities to adopt
floodplain hazard mitigation regulations appears in section 76-5-101 through
406 Montana Code Annotated. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)
12-1-2: FINDINGS:
   A.   Recurrent flooding of a portion of the city of Belgrade's land
resources causes loss of life, damage to property, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, and unsanitary conditions; all of which are detrimental
to the health, safety, welfare, and property of occupants of flooded lands and
the people of Belgrade; and
   B.   The public interest necessitates management and regulation of flood
prone land and waters in a manner consistent with sound land and water use
management practices which will prevent and alleviate flooding threats to life
and health and reduce private and public economic losses. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-
2011)
12-1-3: PURPOSE:
To promote the public health, safety and general welfare, to minimize flood
losses in areas subject to flood hazards and to promote wise use of the
floodplain. These regulations have been established with the following purposes
intended:
   A.   To guide development within the floodplain areas inside the corporate
limits of the city of Belgrade:
      1.   Recognizing the right and need of watercourses to periodically carry
more than the normal flow of water;
      2.   Participating in coordinating efforts of federal, state and local
management activities for floodplains; and
      3.   Maintain regulations and minimum standards, insofar as possible,
that balance the greatest public good with the least private injury.
   B.   Specifically it is the purpose of these regulations to:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause increased flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Identify lands unsuitable for certain development purposes because
of flood hazards;
      4.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      5.   Support the provisions of 36.15.204(2)(g) administrative rules of
Montana, which require disclosure to potential buyers of property within a
floodplain and subject to the provisions of these regulations; and
      6.   Inform those who occupy floodplains that they are responsible for
their actions. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)
CHAPTER 2
DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
12-2-1: Terms Defined
12-2-1: TERMS DEFINED:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give these regulations their most reasonable application. Additional
definitions for terms commonly used for floodplain management purposes are
provided by FEMA and DNRC. Such terms and definitions may be utilized by the
floodplain administrator for the purposes of administering these regulations
where the term is defined by FEMA or DNRC and is not in conflict with a
definition included in these regulations.
ACT: Montana floodplain and floodway management act, title 76, chapter 5,
Montana Code Annotated.
ALTERATION(S): Any change or addition to an artificial obstruction that either
increases the size of the artificial obstruction or increases its potential
flood hazard. Maintenance of an artificial obstruction is not an alteration.
APPEAL: A request for a review by the Belgrade city council of the decision of
the floodplain administrator.
ARTIFICIAL OBSTRUCTION: Any obstruction which is not natural and includes any
dam, diversion, wall, riprap, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, revetment, excavation, channel rectification, bridge, conduit,
culvert, building, refuse, automobile body, fill or other analogous structure
or matter in, along, across or projecting into any floodplain which may impede,
retard or alter the pattern of flow of water, either in itself or by catching
or collecting debris carried by the water, or that is placed where the natural
flow of water would carry the same downstream to the damage or detriment of
either life or property.
BASE FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD): A flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. A base flood is the same as a flood of
100-year frequency.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION: The elevation above sea level of the base flood in
relation to North American vertical datum of 1988 unless another datum is
otherwise specified in the flood insurance study.
CHANNELIZATION PROJECT: Excavation or construction or both of an artificial
channel for the purpose of diverting the entire flow of a stream from its
established course.
COUNCIL: The Belgrade city council.
DNRC: Montana department of natural resources and conservation.
DECISION: The action rendered by the floodplain administrator: a) on an
application for a permit; or b) on a request for interpretation of a floodplain
boundary.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ESTABLISH: To construct, place, insert or excavate.
FEMA: The federal emergency management agency.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP: The map on which FEMA has delineated the 100-year
floodplain, the base flood elevations (BFE) and risk premium zones.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The report in which FEMA has provided flood profiles, as
well as the flood boundary/floodway map and the water surface profiles.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry lands from the overflow of a stream, or the unusual
and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOODPLAIN: The areas subject to these regulations, generally adjoining a
stream, which would be covered by floodwater of a base flood except for
designated sheet flood areas that receive less than one foot (1') of water per
occurrence which are considered "zone B" by FEMA. The floodplain consists of a
floodway and floodway fringe. The floodplain is delineated according to where
the base flood elevation intersects surveyed elevations of natural ground.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The person authorized under subsection
12-4-1A of this title to administer these regulations.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a stream and those portions of the floodplain
adjoining the channel that must be reserved in order to discharge a base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one-half
foot (1/2').
FLOODWAY FRINGE: That portion of the floodplain outside the limits of the
floodway.
LEVEE: A manmade embankment, usually earthen, designed and constructed in
accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the
flow of water to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as drainage and closure devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). Any floor used for living purposes which includes working, storage,
sleeping, cooking and eating, or recreation or any combination thereof. This
includes any floor that could be converted to such a use such as a basement or
crawl space. (An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor.) The lowest floor is
a determinate for the flood insurance premium for a building, home, or
business.
LOWEST FLOOR ELEVATION: The elevation of the lowest floor reported in the North
American vertical datum of 1988, unless another datum is otherwise specified in
the flood insurance study.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure that is transportable in one or more sections,
built on a permanent chassis, and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. This term also
includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a
site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel or contiguous parcels of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: The North American vertical datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum
to which base flood elevations are referenced.

substantial improvement or alteration commences on or after the effective date
of these regulations.
NONCONFORMING USES: Uses, artificial obstructions, development, and structures
that existed prior to adoption of floodplain regulations by the city of
Belgrade on May 12, 1997, but that are not in conformance with the requirements
of these regulations. To be considered a valid nonconforming use, the
floodplain administrator may require documentation to demonstrate the
nonconforming use met the requirements of all applicable laws at the time it
was established.
100-YEAR FLOOD: A 100-year flood is the same as the base flood.
PERMIT(S): A floodplain development permit.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARK OR CAMPGROUND: A parcel or contiguous parcels of land
divided into two (2) or more recreational vehicle spaces for rent or sale.
REGULATIONS: These city of Belgrade floodplain regulations.
RIPRAP: Stone, rocks, concrete blocks or analogous material that is placed
along the banks or bed of a stream for the purpose of alleviating erosion.
SHEET FLOOD AREA: Areas subject to 100-year flooding with depths less than one
foot (1'), removed from the main stem channel, and identified as zone B by
FEMA.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Commencement of clearing, grading, filling, or
excavating to prepare a site for construction.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, (or) a gas or
liquid storage tank, bridge, culvert, dam, diversion, wall, revetment, dike, or
other projection that may impede, retard, or alter the pattern of flow of
water.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring
the structure to its condition before damage would equal or exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started, or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to
occur when the first construction to any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of the building commences. A substantial improvement differs
from the alteration of a structure in that it is not qualified by affecting the
external dimensions of the structure. The term also does not include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or state inventory of historic places.
SUITABLE FILL: Fill material which is stable, compacted, well graded, pervious,
generally unaffected by water and frost, devoid of trash or similar foreign
matter, and tree stumps or other organic material; and is fitted for the
purpose of supporting the intended use or a permanent structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of these regulations which
would permit construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by
these regulations.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)

ordinary and emergency services; and
         m.   Such other factors as are in harmony with the purposes of these
regulations, the Montana floodplain and floodway management act and the
national flood insurance program.
   C.   Decision On Permit Application: In accordance with section 76-5-405(2)
Montana Code Annotated, unless the floodplain administrator has requested
additional information from the applicant, a decision on an application for a
permit shall be made within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete
application. The floodplain administrator may approve, conditionally approve,
or deny applications for permit.
   D.   Administrative Procedures: The floodplain administrator shall adopt
such administrative procedures as may be necessary to efficiently administer
the provision of these regulations.
   E.   Maintain Files And Records: The floodplain administrator shall maintain
such files and records as may be necessary to document nonconforming uses, base
flood elevations, floodproofing and elevation certifications, fee receipts, the
issuance of permits, agendas, minutes, records of public meetings, and any
other matters relating to floodplain management in Gallatin County. Such files
and records shall be open for public inspection.
   F.   Copies Of Permits Granted: Copies of all permits granted must be sent
to the Montana department of natural resources and conservation.
   G.   Additional Information: The floodplain administrator may require
whatever additional information is necessary to determine whether the proposed
activity meets the requirements of these regulations. Additional information
may include hydraulic calculations assessing the impact on base flood
elevations or velocities; level survey; or certification by a Montana licensed
land surveyor, professional engineer or architect that the requirements of
these regulations are satisfied.
   H.   Notice: Upon receipt of an application for a permit, the floodplain
administrator shall prepare a notice containing the facts pertinent to the
application and shall publish the notice at least once in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area. Notice shall also be served by first class
mail upon adjacent property owners and provided to the DNRC floodplain
management section. The notice shall provide a reasonable period of time, not
less than fifteen (15) days, for interested parties to submit comments on the
proposed activity. The notice requirements for variances or appeals shall be
the same, except notice to adjoining property owners shall be through certified
mail.
   I.   Flood Carrying Capacity Maintained: The flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion of any stream must be maintained. Erosion
control measures shall be incorporated to ensure stability of altered channels
and stream banks. Prior to any alteration or relocation of a stream in riverine
situations, notification by the floodplain administrator must be made to
adjacent local governments, the floodplain management section (DNRC), and the
federal emergency management agency. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)
12-4-2: PERMIT APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Activities or uses which require the issuance of a permit, including
the expansion, substantial improvement or alteration of such uses, shall not be
initiated, established or undertaken until a permit has been issued by the
floodplain administrator.
   B.   Applicants for permits may be required to furnish such of the following
as is deemed necessary by the floodplain administrator for determining the
suitability of the particular site for the proposed use:
      1.   Plans in duplicate drawn to scale with dimensions shown, showing the
nature, location and elevation of the lot, existing and proposed structure
locations, fill, storage or materials sites, floodproofing measures, first
floor of proposed structures in mean sea level elevation and location of the
channel;
      2.   A plan view of the proposed development indicating external
dimensions of structures, street or road, finished grade elevations, well
locations, individual sewage treatment and disposal sites, excavation, fill
quantity estimates, site plan and construction plans; and
      3.   Specifications for floodproofing, filling, excavating, grading,
riprapping, storage of materials and utilities location.
      4.   In evaluating a proposed use within a floodplain for which no
floodway has been designated, the floodplain administrator may require the
applicant to submit the following:
         a.   Cross Sections: A minimum of four (4) surveyed valley cross
sections by a Montana licensed land surveyor according to the following field
survey instructions:
            (1)   The surveys required are cross sections of stream channels
and the floodplain on both banks.
            (2)   One cross section shall be taken at a point on the stream
from which it could be extended through the site. For projects involving a
structure, this cross section should be located at the upstream end of the
structure. For projects that do not involve structures, this cross section
should be taken at the upstream end of the property.
            (3)   Three (3) cross sections shall be taken downstream from the
site, each approximately one thousand feet (1,000') apart. In no case, however,
should the fall in the base flood elevation between two (2) sections exceed
five feet (5.0'). Cross sections should also be taken at all bridge locations
in the reach. The cross section farthest downstream should be located at a
natural constriction or at a bridge crossing. Cross sections shall be taken at
any bridge location between site and lowest cross section. All bridges in the
reach should be described and sketched showing unobstructed waterway openings
and elevations.
            (4)   Distances between cross sections are to be determined by
stadia, and these distances and locations of cross sections shall be shown on
the location map.
            (5)   The overbank cross sections are to be extended to obtain a
vertical rise of fifteen feet (15') above the water surface.
            (6)   If a U.S. geological survey river gauging station is within
the reach of the stream under study, the elevation of any convenient foot mark
shall be surveyed and clearly indicated on the location map.
            (7)   Elevations of the water surface determined by survey as part
of each valley cross section.
            (8)   Cross sections should be plotted on ten (10) divisions to the
inch cross section paper, using any convenient, identified scale for vertical
and horizontal distance.
               (A)   Elevation Of High Water Mark: The elevation of any known

with the minimum standards contained in these regulations according to the
following procedures.
   B.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by the variance
application fee. The application must clearly state the facts and circumstances
on which any variance is requested.
      1.   In order to have FEMA review and approve the technical basis of the
proposed variance prior to the variance being considered by the council,
variance requests involving any of the circumstances described below require
approval of a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) by FEMA prior to
submission of the variance application to the floodplain administrator:
         a.   A project in the floodway that would result in any increase
(greater than or equal to 1/100 of 1 foot) in base flood elevations after
considering allowable encroachments into the floodway fringe;
         b.   A project that would increase the base flood elevation greater
than one-half foot (1/2') in an area where base flood elevations have been
specified but no floodway has been designated; and
         c.   A project that would increase the base flood elevation greater
than one-half foot (1/2') in an unnumbered zone A floodplain.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that refusal of a variance would, because of
exceptional circumstances, cause a unique or undue hardship on the applicant or
community involved;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not increase
flood hazard either upstream or downstream in the area of insurable building,
present additional threats to public safety, be an extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing laws or ordinances;
         d.   A determination that a proposed use would be adequately
floodproofed;
         e.   A determination that a reasonable alternative location outside
the floodplain is not available;
         f.   A determination that the variance requested is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and
         g.   Approval of DNRC, upon request from the city prior to formally
approving any permit application which is in variation to these regulations.
      3.   Variances shall be issued in writing from the Belgrade city council
who shall notify the applicant that:
         a.   A specific variance is granted, and that certain conditions may
be attached,
         b.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates, and
         c.   Such construction below the base flood elevation increases risks
to life and property.
The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of variance
notification, variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and
forward copies of all variance actions to the Montana department of natural
resources and conservation and the federal emergency management agency.
      4.   Upon approval of a variance, the applicant shall be required to
obtain a permit to document compliance with the conditions of the variance and
all other applicable requirements of these floodplain regulations. A separate
application fee shall be required for the permit.
   C.   An aggrieved person may appeal any decision of the floodplain
administrator to the council by filing a notice of appeal no more than thirty
(30) days after the date of the decision. An appeal shall allege the floodplain
administrator's decision was an erroneous interpretation or application of
these regulations or relevant state or federal laws. The notice of appeal shall
be in writing and be served in person or by mail upon the floodplain
administrator. The appellant shall have an additional thirty (30) days after
providing a notice of appeal to submit a formal appeal request which shall set
forth the decision appealed from, document the basis for the appeal and be
accompanied by the appropriate application fee. The council shall hold a public
hearing on the appeal, and shall take testimony and enter findings of fact and
conclusions and shall make such findings and conclusions available to the
appellant within a reasonable time. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)

additional information shows that the proposed use would cause an additional
flood hazard to adjacent property or significantly increase flood heights. A
significant increase in flood heights is one-half foot (1/2') unless existing
or anticipated development in the area dictates a lesser amount of allowable
increase. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)
12-5-5: FLOODPLAIN AREAS WITHOUT BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS OR DELINEATED FLOODWAYS
(ZONE A):
The following requirements apply to the floodplains delineated by approximated

any base flood elevation or floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source, until such data has been provided by the federal emergency
management agency to enforce these regulations;
      3.   Historical flood elevations may be used by the floodplain
administrator in determining suitable fill or floodproofing elevations to be
achieved, and used to enforce these regulations;
      4.   If historical flood evidence is not available, then the floodplain
administrator shall determine, from a field review at the proposed development
site, an appropriate fill or floodproofing elevation or both to be utilized in
applying these regulations. In the absence of depth or elevation, a minimum two
foot (2') flood depth shall be used; and
      5.   Proposed structures must be anchored to prevent flotation or
collapse and must be located as far from stream channels as practicable.
   C.   Prohibited Uses: Those uses prohibited in the floodway fringe, in
accordance with subsection
12-5-3C of this chapter, shall also be prohibited within the zone A boundaries.
   D.   Floodplain Boundary Interpretation: The floodplain administrator shall
make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the zone A
boundary when there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)
12-5-6: SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO):
   A.   Shallow flooding areas are delineated as zone AO on the official maps.
The provisions of section
12-5-3, "Floodway Fringe", of this chapter shall apply to zone AO. The flooding
depth of 100-year frequency is indicated as the depth number on the official
maps and shall be referenced to the crown of the nearest street or stream flow
line in determining fill or floodproofing heights or both which are to be
utilized in applying the provisions of subsection
12-5-3B of this chapter. In the absence of depth or elevation information, a
minimum two foot (2') flood depth shall be used.
      1.   Floodplain Boundary Interpretation: The floodplain administrator
shall make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of a zone AO
boundary when there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions. (Ord. 2011-5, 10-17-2011)

receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than five (5) business
days, the grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily

street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of
sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of structures or
improvements by the franchise authority; but, the grantee shall in all cases

charge the property owner for the cost of removal of the trees and natural
growth if similar charges are assessed and paid to utilities or the franchise
authority for such work. The grantee shall reasonably compensate the franchise

underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain all of
its transmission and distribution facilities underground; provided, that such
facilities are actually capable of receiving grantee's cable and other
equipment without technical degradation of the cable system's signal quality.
In those areas of the service area where the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are both aerial and underground, grantee
shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or
underground. Nothing contained in subsection F of this section shall require
grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground mounted
appurtenances such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices

subsection F of this section, in the event that all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective

be due and payable forty five (45) days after close of quarter. Each payment
shall be accompanied by a report from a representative of grantee showing the
basis for the computation.
   B.   Limitation On Franchise Fee Actions: The period of limitation for
recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five (5) years from
the date on which payment by the company is due. Unless, within five (5) years
from and after said payment due date, the franchise authority initiates a
lawsuit for recovery of such franchise fees in the court of competent
jurisdiction, such recovery shall be barred and the franchise authority shall
be estopped from asserting any claims whatsoever against the company relating
to any such alleged deficiencies. No acceptance of any payment or partial
payment by the franchise authority shall be construed as a release or as an
accord and satisfaction of any claim the franchising authority may have for
further or additional sums payable under this franchise agreement for the
performance of any obligation hereunder, within the said five (5) year
limitation. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-9: LATE PAYMENT FEE:
Should the grantee ever fail to pay any sums of money to the franchise
authority owing to the grantor, under provisions of this agreement when such
sum becomes due and payable, grantee shall pay interest to the franchise
authority on the delinquent sum until it is fully paid, at two (2) interest
points above the prime rate of interest charged in Belgrade city area as
calculated by the franchise authority. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-10: GRANTOR INSPECTION RIGHT:
The grantee agrees that the franchise authority may review such of its books
and records, during normal business hours and as is reasonably necessary to
monitor compliance with the terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall
not be limited to, any public records required to be kept by the grantee
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. The franchise authority or
its representative shall have the right to inspect the grantee's records to
determine if proper payments have been made to the franchise authority. The
costs of such audits shall be borne by grantee if same results in increasing,
by more than two percent (2%), the grantee's annual payment to the franchise
authority. The franchise authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by
the grantee to it as confidential and only to disclose it to employees,
representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to
enforce the provisions hereof. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-11: RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE:
The franchise authority and the grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken
by the franchise authority that relate to the renewal of the grantee's
franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of section 626 of
the cable act (as such existed as of the effective date of the cable act),
unless the procedures and substantive protection set forth therein shall be
deemed to be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent
provisions of federal or state law.
In addition to the procedures set forth in said section 626(a), the franchise
authority agrees to notify grantee of its preliminary assessments regarding the
identity of future cable related community needs and interests, as well as, the
past performance of grantee under the then current franchise term. The
franchise authority further agrees that such a preliminary assessment shall be
provided to the grantee prior to the time that the four (4) month period
referred to in subsection (c) of section 626 is considered to begin.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section 13-2-11, the
grantee and franchise authority agree that at any time during the term of the
then current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and
opportunity to comment, the franchise authority and grantee may agree to
undertake and finalize negotiations regarding renewal of the then current
franchise and the franchise authority may grant a renewal thereof. The grantee
and the franchise authority consider the terms set forth in this section to be
consistent with the express provisions of section 626 of the cable act. A
reproduction of section 626 of the cable act as such existed as of the
effective date of the cable act is attached hereto as schedule 1 and
incorporated herein by this reference. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-12: TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE:
Grantee's right, title, or interest to the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate of
the grantee, without the prior consent of the franchise authority, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however,
for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment
of any right, title, or interest in grantee in the franchise or cable system in
order to secure indebtedness. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-13: INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS:
Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense,
during the term of the franchise, comprehensive general liability insurance in
the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) combined single limit for
bodily injury, and property damage. Said insurance shall designate the
franchise authority as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be
noncancelable except upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the
franchise authority. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-14: INDEMNIFICATION:
The grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the
franchise authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any
liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property
damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the
grantee's construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees and costs. (Ord. 94-4,
8-1-1994)
13-2-15: BONDS AND OTHER SURETY:
Except as expressly provided herein, grantee shall not be required to obtain or
maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the franchise or
continuing its existence. The franchise authority acknowledges that the legal,
financial, and technical qualifications of grantee are sufficient to afford
compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement thereof. Grantee
and franchise authority recognize that the costs associated with bonds and
other surety may ultimately be borne by the subscribers in the form of
increased rates for cable services. In order to minimize such costs, the
franchise authority agrees to require bonds and other surety only in such
amounts and during such times as there is a reasonably demonstrated need
therefor. The franchise authority agrees that in no event, however, shall it
require a bond or other related surety in an aggregated amount greater than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00), conditioned upon the substantial performance of
the material terms, covenants, and conditions of the franchise. Initially, no
bond or other surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the
future, the franchise authority agrees to give grantee at least sixty (60)
days' prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the
requirement. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the grantee's legal,
financial, or technical qualifications which would materially prohibit or
impair its ability to comply with the terms of the franchise or afford
compliance therewith. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-16: NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
In the event that the franchise authority believes that the grantee has not
complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify grantee, in writing,
of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-17: GRANTEE'S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND:
Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice described in
section
13-2-16 of this chapter to: a) respond to the franchise authority contesting
the assertion of noncompliance, or b) to cure such default or, in the event
that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty
(30) day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify
the franchise authority of the steps being taken and the projected date that
they will be completed. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-18: PUBLIC HEARINGS:
   A.   Failure To Comply; Hearing Scheduled: In the event that grantee fails
to respond to the notice described in section
13-2-16 of this chapter pursuant to the procedures set forth in section
13-2-17 of this chapter, or in the event that the alleged default is not
remedied within sixty (60) days after the grantee is notified of the alleged
default pursuant to section
13-2-16 of this chapter, the franchise authority shall schedule a public
meeting to investigate the default. Such public meeting shall be held at the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the franchise authority which is scheduled
at a time which is no less than five (5) business days therefrom. The franchise
authority shall notify the grantee with an opportunity to be heard.
   B.   Enforcement: Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event
the franchise authority, after such meeting, determines that grantee is in
default of any provision of the franchise, the franchise authority may:
      1.   Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under this
franchise, if any, including, without limitation, any bonds or other surety;
provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in such
amount as the franchise authority reasonably determines is necessary to remedy
the default;
      2.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief;
      3.   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked; or
      4.   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages.
The grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly
with any provision of the franchise by reason or any failure of the franchise
authority to enforce prompt compliance.
   C.   Acts Of God: The grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance
with the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty
relating thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by
strikes, acts of God, power outages, or other events reasonably beyond its
ability to control. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-19: NOTICE:
Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response
to be served upon the franchise authority or grantee shall be in writing, and
shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party five (5) business
days after having been posted in a properly sealed and correctly addressed
envelope by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, at a post office or
branch thereof regularly maintained by the U.S. postal service. The notices or
responses to the franchise authority shall be addressed as follows:

The franchising authority and the grantee may designate such other address or

1994)
13-2-20: EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE:
   A.   Required Extensions Of Service: The cable system as constructed as of
the date of the passage and final adoption of this chapter substantially
complies with the material provisions hereof. Grantee is hereby authorized to
extend the cable system as necessary, as desirable, or as required pursuant to
the terms hereof within the service area. Whenever grantee shall receive a
request for service from at least fifteen (15) subscribers within two thousand
six hundred forty (2,640) cable bearing strand feet (1/2 cable mile) of its
trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its cable system to such
subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for system extension, other than the
usual connection fees for all subscribers; provided, that such extension is
technically feasible, and if it will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition, or market development of the cable system, or as provided
for in this subsection.
   B.   Subscriber Charges For Extensions Of Service: No subscriber shall be
refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a
subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground, existence of more
than one hundred fifty feet (150') of distance from distribution cable to
connection of service to subscribers, or a density of less than fifteen (15)
subscribers per two thousand six hundred forty (2,640) cable bearing strand
feet of trunk or distribution cable, cable service or other service may be made
available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction,
including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of
determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be
borne by grantee and subscribers in the area in which cable service may be
expanded, grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other
costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual
number of potential subscribers per two thousand six hundred forty (2,640)
cable bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose
denominator equals fifteen (15) subscribers. Potential subscribers will bear
the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. Grantee
may require that the payment of the capital contribution in said construction
borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-21: CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The grantee shall maintain a business office and service center with toll free
telephone numbers so that subscribers may report service outages or
deficiencies at any time. The office shall maintain an adequate staff such that
subscribers may transact all necessary business during regular business hours.
Grantee's employees shall maintain a high standard of courtesy in customer
relations at all times. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-22: STREET WORK:
The grantee at his expense shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect,
relocate, or remove any property of grantee when required by the grantor or
other relevant governmental unit by reason of traffic conditions, public
safety, street vacation, freeway or street construction; change or
establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes,
power lines, structure or improvements by governmental agencies whether acting
in a governmental or proprietary capacity, or any other structure of public
improvement, including, but not limited to, movement of buildings, urban
renewal and redevelopment, and any general program under which the grantor or
other relevant governmental unit shall undertake to cause all such properties
to be located beneath the surface of the ground; provided, that grantee shall
in all cases have the privileges and be under the obligations as to the
abandonment of franchise property in places which are provided in the
appropriate sections hereof. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-23: REMOVAL OR ABANDONMENT:
   A.   In the event the use of any grantee property is permanently
discontinued, or upon expiration of or within twelve (12) months after any
termination of a franchise, and subject to applicable federal or state law, the
grantee shall promptly remove from the streets all property involved, other
than that which the franchise authority may, at its sole option, permit to be
abandoned in place.
   B.   A permit to abandon in place must be obtained from franchise authority.
Nothing hereunder shall be deemed as taking of the property of grantee, and
grantee shall be entitled to no surcharge by reason of anything hereunder.
(Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-24: REPORTS, RECORDS AND PLANS:
The grantee shall at all times make and keep at its Bozeman office full and
complete plans and records showing the exact location of all cable
communications system equipment installed or in use in the streets and other
public places in Belgrade city. The grantee shall also keep at its Bozeman
office, a current map or set of maps drawn to scale showing all cable
communications system equipment installed and in place in streets and other
public places in the service area. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-25: MISDEMEANOR:
   A.   In addition to those criminal and civil remedies provided by state and
federal law, it shall be a misdemeanor for any person, firm, or corporation to
create or make use of any unauthorized connection, whether physically,
electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any part of the
cable system without the express consent of the grantee. Further, without the
express consent of grantee, it shall be a misdemeanor for any person to tamper
with, remove, or injure any property, equipment, or part of the cable system or
any means of receiving cable services or other services provided thereto.
   B.   Subject to applicable federal and state law, the franchise authority
shall incorporate into its criminal code, if not presently a part thereof,
criminal misdemeanor law which will enforce the intent of this section. (Ord.
94-4, 8-1-1994)
13-2-26: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision hereof is determined to
be illegal, invalid or unconstitutional, by any court of competent jurisdiction
or by any state or federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof,
such determination shall have no effect on the validity of any other section,
sentence, paragraph, term or provision hereof, all of which will remain in full
force and effect for the term of the franchise or any renewal or renewals
thereof. (Ord. 94-4, 8-1-1994)

procedure, as amended and supplemented during the franchise renewal negotiation
process;
   C.   Any franchise agreement between grantee and franchise authority

13-2-29: PREEMPTION:
If the FCC or any other federal or state body or agency shall now or hereafter
exercise any paramount jurisdiction over the subject matter of the franchise,

the exercise of the like jurisdiction by the franchise authority, the
jurisdiction of the franchise authority shall cease and no longer exist. (Ord.
94-4, 8-1-1994)
