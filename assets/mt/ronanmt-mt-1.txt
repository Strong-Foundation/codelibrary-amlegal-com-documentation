than four cats and/or three dogs, over six months of age, without first having
obtained a kennel license from the city as herein provided. This section shall
not apply to licensed veterinarian hospitals or animal shelters, but it is
intended to apply to keeping or maintaining kennels where cats and dogs are
kept for breeding, sale, sporting purposes, boarding, or for the enjoyment of
the household. Any person keeping or maintaining a kennel shall make
application to the city for said kennel license, shall be authorized or denied
at the discretion of the chief of police.
   (B)   Kennel licensing procedure.
      (1)   All applications for a kennel license, including applications for
renewal or reinstatement, shall be reviewed by the chief of police or designee,
who shall inspect the premises of the proposed kennel and make findings, as set
forth herein, regarding said application.
      (2)   All kennel licenses shall be for a designated purpose, and a
specific number and type of cats and dogs. Licenses shall not be transferable
from one person to another person or place.
      (3)   New kennel licenses shall only be issued after the chief of police
or designee, upon appropriate inspection of the applicant's proposed kennel and
other appropriate investigation, approves the application. The application must
be accompanied by written approval (i.e., petition format) of the application
of the property owners within 200 feet in any direction from the property line
of the residence of the applicant. Names and addresses of the property owners
and/or occupants shall be supplied by the applicant. The form will be provided
by the city and shall specify the name and address of the applicant, the name
and address of the owner of record of the property, a brief statement of the
nature of the kennel license application, including the number and type of cats
or dogs proposed in the application and reference to the procedures described
herein. Applicant's failure to properly complete and deliver all notice forms
constitute cause to deny the application or revoke the kennel license.
      (4)   The chief of police or designee, in approving a kennel license,
shall determine:
         (a)   That all animals listed on the kennel license application
possess current city pet licenses;
         (b)   That the site for the proposed use is adequate in size and
topography to accommodate such use, and all yards, spaces, fences and
enclosures are adequate to properly relate such use with the land and uses in
the vicinity;
         (c)   That the proposed use will have minimal adverse effect on
abutting properties or residents within the affected area; and
         (d)   That any conditions stated in the approval are deemed necessary
and shall apply and be followed by the applicant and the property owner as a
condition of approval.
      (5)   Upon granting a kennel license, the chief of police or designee may
thereafter inspect the premises to ensure compliance with this chapter and
ensure the health and welfare of the animals.
      (6)   A kennel license holder shall notify the chief of police or
designee of any change in the operations which may affect the license and shall
keep the chief of police apprised of any change in name, use, or location of
said kennel, including, but not limited to, changes in animals and numbers of
either cats or dogs listed on the original kennel license application.
   (C)   The kennel license fee shall be in an amount as set by resolution of
the city council, and the license shall expire on December 31 of each year,
unless sooner revoked. License fees shall be reduced by 50% if application is
made, and subsequently approved, between July 1 and December 31. The kennel
license application fee is nonrefundable.
   (D)   Upon a complaint being made to the chief of police or designee that a
licensed kennel is being operated in an improper manner. After finding the
kennel was operated improperly, as a nuisance, or a condition existed that
would preclude the issuance of a license, the chief of police or designee may
revoke the license of such kennel, after providing the licensee a minimum of 72
hours. The licensee may, at the discretion of the chief of police or designee
be provided up to 15 days to mitigate an offending condition and thus have the
license reinstated. Reinstatement findings by the chief of police or designee
shall be made only after conduction of a subsequent site inspection and report
stating that each offending condition of the kennel in question was
satisfactorily corrected and the kennel complies with conditions set forth in
this chapter.
   (E)   Upon annual re-application for a kennel license renewal, an inspection
of the premises, in accordance with division B of this section, may be waived
by the chief of police or designee, unless conditions listed in division D of
this section are found to exist.
   (F)   Decisions by the chief of police or designee to approve or deny a
kennel license application, revoke an existing kennel license or reinstate a
revoked kennel license may be appealed to the city council. A written request
for an appeal hearing before the city council shall be submitted to the mayor.
Any appeal of a kennel license application approval or denial, or appeal of an
existing kennel license revocation or reinstatement decision by the chief of
police shall be in writing wherein the appellant shall set forth the specific
provisions of the decision being appealed. Written notice of an appeal of a
kennel license application approval or denial or existing kennel license
revocation or reinstatement, including specific provisions of the decision
being appealed and the date, time and location of the subsequent city council
appeal hearing as set by the city council, shall thereafter be provided by the
applicant to all owners of real property within 200 feet of the site in
question, including the property owner if the site in question is not owned by
the applicant, at least 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing. Applicant's
failure to properly complete and deliver all appeal notice forms may constitute
cause to deny the appeal. Upon review of an appeal, the city council shall have
the authority to affirm, modify, or reverse the findings of the chief of police
or designee. Council affirmation, modification or reversal of a decision made
by the chief of police or designee shall be final and binding.

provide proof of ownership within 96 hours, or it shall be subject to disposal
as provided in §
5-1-13.
   (B)   The owner of any impounded dog or other animal not suspected or known
to have dangerous or vicious propensities, or impounded on the belief said
animal is repeatedly at large, or is a nuisance, or which has been the subject
of abuse may redeem the same within 96 hours of impoundment by accepting a
citation for violation of any ordinance of the city for which the owner may be
properly charged, and posting any boarding fees to the animal shelter in
accordance with its established fee rates.
   (C)   Any unlicensed dog that is impounded may only be redeemed by the owner
procuring a license, as required by §
5-1-2, in addition to paying the fees herein prescribed.
   (D)   It shall be the duty of the owner of any impounded dog or other animal
suspected or known to have dangerous or vicious propensities, or impounded on
the belief said animal is repeatedly at large, or is a nuisance, or has been
the subject of abuse, to petition the Ronan City Court for release of the dog
or other animal within 96 hours of the dog or other animal being impounded. If

vicious propensities, or impounded on the belief said animal has been
repeatedly at large or is a nuisance, or has been subjected to abuse it shall
not be released to the owner unless and until a hearing is held before the
Ronan City Court to determine under what conditions, if any, such animal shall
be released. During the hearing, the court will hear evidence to determine
whether the animal should be declared a dangerous or vicious animal, has been
repeatedly at large or is a nuisance or the animal has been subjected to abuse.
The Court shall also hear evidence that the actions by the animal were the
result of the animal being provoked by the person injured, making the complaint
or otherwise negatively affected by the actions of the animal. The Court shall
hear any recommendations by the police officer. If a determination is made that
the animal is dangerous, vicious, has been repeatedly at large or is a nuisance
or the animal has been subject to abuse, the owner shall be ordered to comply
with provisions or conditions made by the court, including, but not limited to,
ordering confinement of the animal in a secure enclosure and imposition of
impoundment and associated costs, including any cost of destruction.
   (G)   In addition to the procedure herein, a complaint may be filed in Ronan
City Court against the person redeeming or seeking the release of any dog or
other animal impounded for violation of any provision of this chapter.
   (H)   It is an affirmative defense in any proceeding by or against the owner
of the animal that the actions by the animal were the result of the animal
being provoked by the person injured, making the complaint or otherwise
negatively affected by the actions of the animal.

the time it is taken and impounded, the owner thereof shall forfeit all right,
title, and interest therein, and the animal shelter director may offer the same
for sale or adoption. Sale or adoption, and such certificate of sale, shall
confer title and ownership of the dog or other animal, free of all claims and
interest of the previous owner. In the event that any impounded dog or other
animal is not redeemed by the owner or purchased, it may be disposed of by the
animal shelter or contracting agency in a humane manner. Any dog or other
animal suffering from an infectious disease shall not be released but shall be
disposed of, unless the public health officer shall otherwise order. Any animal
deemed dangerous or vicious by the court may not be sold or adopted without
proper disclosure to the individual purchasing or adopting said animal, to

      (10)   Intentionally or knowingly poisons or attempts to poison any
domestic animal. For purposes of this section, "poison" or "attempt to poison"

ventilation. Any person owning or having care, control or custody of any animal
shall provide:
      (1)   That the animal receives daily, food that is free from
contamination and is of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the
animal in good health.
      (2)   That potable water is accessible to the animal at all times, either
free-flowing or in a clean receptacle.
      (3)   That, except for livestock, all animals have convenient access to
natural or artificial shelter throughout the year. Any such artificial shelter
shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animal
from injury and from the elements, and of sufficient size to permit the animal
to enter, stand, turn around and lie down in a natural manner. Any shelter
which does not protect the animal from temperature extremes or precipitation,
or which does not provide adequate ventilation or drainage, shall not comply
with this section. Any shelter, all bedding and any spaces accessible to the
animal shall be maintained in a manner which minimizes the risk of the animal

the risk of injury to the animal, and shall encompass sufficient usable space
to keep the animal in good condition.
      (6)   That the animal has access to adequate ventilation and is protected
from temperature extremes at all times. In this connection, it is unlawful for
any person to keep any animal in a vehicle or other enclosed space in which the
temperature is either so high or so low, or the ventilation is so inadequate,
as to endanger the animal's life or health. Any police officer is authorized to
use whatever force is reasonable and necessary to remove any animal from a
vehicle or other enclosed space whenever it appears that the animal's life or
health is endangered by extreme temperatures or lack of ventilation within the
vehicle or other enclosed space.
         (a)   No police officer shall be liable for damages to property caused
by the use of reasonable force to remove an animal from such a vehicle or other
enclosed space under such circumstances.
   (D)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section may be waived by any
police officer if dictated by treatment under the direction of a licensed
veterinarian.
   (E)   Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor.
   (F)   Penalty. Each person convicted of a violation of these sections shall
be fined according with the schedule of fees and fines.
   (G)   No judge may grant probation in lieu of, or otherwise suspend, the
imposition of the minimum fine prescribed herein. The judge may order that the
owner shall not be permitted to own or control any animal for a period of up to
three years, and the judge may order that the animal(s) which are the subject
of this action be forfeited to the Humane Society or other suitable agency to
be placed by adoption in a suitable home or humanely destroyed. The court also
shall order the convicted person to make restitution to the city or to any
person, agency, or volunteer who has contracted with the city to care for an
animal that is seized and impounded pursuant to this or other provisions of
this section for the cost of care for the animal incurred from the time of
seizure or impoundment to the time of conviction. This shall not be construed
to affect, in any way, the imposition of any mandatory minimum penalties
provided herein.

      (3)   There will be a strict limit of six adult (aged over six months)

sources or electrical facilities are to be installed in the detached utility
building. Any lighting must be solar or battery-operated devices. Absolutely no
"extension cord wiring" will be permitted.
      (6)   The permittee shall provide the chickens with a predator-proof
enclosure of sufficient size to admit free movement of the chickens. Chicken
enclosures may be moveable.
      (7)   Chickens shall be secured within the enclosure from sunset to
sunrise.
      (8)   Chicken enclosures and detached utility building must always be
kept in a neat and sanitary condition and must be cleaned on a regular basis to
prevent offensive odors.
      (9)   Chickens shall have continuous access to adequate food and water.
      (10)   Stored feed must be kept in a rodent-proof and predator-proof
container.
      (11)   Chickens shall be maintained in a healthy condition. Ill chickens
shall either receive appropriate medical care or be culled.
      (12)   No detached utility building shall be located closer than 20 feet
to any structure inhabited by someone other than the chicken owner, custodian,
or keeper, and not closer than 10-feet to any property line, nor located within
any setbacks of the property. Detached utility building may be moveable but

      (13)   No chicken shall be kept in a manner to create noxious odors or
noise of a loud, persistent, and habitual nature.
      (14)   No chickens shall be slaughtered within the public view.
      (15)   If specific provisions of §
5-1-22 Chickens, conflict with general provisions of the Animal Control
Ordinance, the specific provisions of §
5-1-22 Chickens govern.
   (B)   Permits required/inspections.
      (1)   Prior to keeping of any chickens, a party seeking to keep chickens
shall obtain a permit, from the City. A permit fee may be established by
resolution of the City Council and may be revised from time to time. Only one
permit shall be issued per address. Issuance of a permit is a discretionary
act.
      (2)   All chicken permits are valid for one calendar year unless sooner
revoked. Permits shall expire December 31. Permits must be renewed within 30
days of the expiration date or the application will be treated as a new
application. It is the applicant's responsibility to renew chicken permit prior
to the expiration of said permit. Failure to obtain a chicken permit prior to
opening and/or operating any facility covered in this section shall result in a
fine of $100.00. Each day a violation exists may be charged as a separate
offense.
      (3)   The owner of the chickens shall keep a copy of all signed city
approval documents for inspection upon request by code enforcement officer,
animal control officer, or police officer.
      (4)   A permit for chickens under this section does not relieve any party
from any requirement to obtain any other permit or other necessary approvals
for any structure, fence, lighting, etc. as required by this Code.
      (5)   A party wishing to keep chickens shall submit an application to the
City to keep chickens. The application shall contain the following:
         (a)   A sketch identifying the property boundaries, the location of
all structures on the property and distances between said structures and
between the property boundaries. The sketch must also indicate the location of
the proposed chicken enclosure and detached utility building.
         (b)   The name, address, and signed statement of the property owner.
         (c)   The number of chickens kept.

application are true and that the permit holder shall keep the chickens in
compliance with the terms of the permit, application and this section.
         (f)   Where the party seeking to keep chickens is not the fee owner of
the property upon which chickens will be kept, the applicant shall obtain the
property owner's consent in writing to keep chickens on the property. The
owner's consent shall be submitted with the permit application or renewal.
      (6)   The party shall have the location inspected prior to the keeping of
chickens. The inspector shall review the enclosure, detached utility building,
and all matters related to the keeping of chickens. Applicant's failure to
properly complete all forms may constitute cause to deny the application or
revoke the permit.
      (7)   If, during any inspection, the inspector determines changes are to
be made to the enclosure, detached utility building, or to the number of
chickens to be kept, or require mitigation for the impact to adjacent
properties, such as fencing or other screening, the applicant/permit holder
shall comply with the order of the inspector. A person aggrieved by a decision
of the inspector may appeal to the city counsel who shall review all applicable
information and issue a decision on the appeal. At the time of final approval
by the inspector or, on appeal, by the city council, the Clerk shall indicate
final approval on the permit and keep a record of final approval.
      (8)   A permit to keep chickens is specific to the permit holder and the
location of the permit. A person wishing to move chickens to a different
property shall obtain a new permit. A new resident of a property who intends to
keep chickens shall obtain a new permit regardless of whether chickens were
kept on the property or continue to be kept on the property.
      (9)   Approval of a permit to keep chickens authorizes the permit holder
to keep six adult chickens in the manner described on the application and
permit.
      (10)   Nothing in this section shall prevent an inspector from requiring
an inspection of a property prior to or after issuance of a permit.
      (11)   A permit holder is required to comply with any new standard,
regulation, or condition, under this section, that is adopted according to
proper legal process.
   (C)   Enforcement. Upon receiving a complaint of a possible violation or
animal cruelty, a police officer will investigate and determine if a violation
of this section exists. If the officer determines a violation exists, the
officer may serve upon the permit holder or the owner or lessee of the property
a written notice of violation and an order to take corrective action, may issue
a warning, or may immediately issue a violation notice. The notice of violation
may be served by leaving the notice in a conspicuous location at the place of
the keeping of the chickens, or by regular US postal mail. The officer will
revisit the address where the violation occurred, no sooner than five days
after the notice of violation is issued to verify corrective action has been
taken. Failure to correct violations as determined by the officer may result in
a citation for each violation as a misdemeanor and punishable as recited under
Ronan City Ordinance §
5-1-21  Schedule of Fees and Fines. Each day a violation exists may be charged
as a separate offence.

SPECIFIC ACTS
§ 6-2-15 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF CRIMINAL ACT AND MENTAL STATE.
   (A)   A person is not guilty of an offense, other than an offense which
involves absolute liability, unless, with respect to each element described by
the statute defining the offense, he or she acts while having one of the mental
states described in divisions (D)(1), (D)(2) and (D)(3) below. The existence of
a mental state may be inferred from the acts of the accused and the facts and
circumstances connected with the offense.
   (B)   If the statute defining an offense prescribes a particular mental
state with respect to the offense as a whole without distinguishing among the
elements thereof, the prescribed mental state applies to each element.
   (C)   Knowledge that certain conduct constitutes an offense or knowledge of
the existence, meaning or application of the statute defining an offense is not
an element of the offense unless the statute clearly defines it as such.
   (D)   (1)   A person’s reasonable belief that his or her conduct does not
constitute an offense is a defense if:
         (a)   The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order
which is not known to him or her and has not been published or otherwise made
reasonably available to him or her and he or she could not have acquired such
knowledge by the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him or
her;
         (b)   He or she acts in reliance upon a status which later is
determined to be invalid;
         (c)   He or she acts in reliance upon an order or opinion of the
Montana Supreme Court or a United States appellate court later overruled or
reversed; and/or
         (d)   He or she acts in reliance upon an official interpretation of
the statute, regulation or order defining the offense made by a public officer
or agency legally authorized to interpret such statute.
      (2)   If a person’s reasonable belief is a defense under division (D)(1)
above, nevertheless he or she may be convicted of an included offense of which
he or she would be guilty if the law were as he or she believed it to be.
      (3)   Any defense based upon this section is an affirmative defense.
(1992 Code, § 8-1-101)
§ 6-2-16 CASUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONDUCT AND RESULT.
   (A)   Conduct is the cause of a result if:
      (1)   Without the conduct the result would not have occurred; and
      (2)   Any additional casual requirements imposed by the specific statute
defining the offense are satisfied.
   (B)   If purposely or knowingly causing a result is an element of an offense
and the result is not within the contemplation of purpose of the offender,
either element can nevertheless be established if:
      (1)   The result differs from that contemplated only in the respect that
a different person or different property is affected or that the injury or harm
caused is less than contemplated; or
      (2)   The result involves the same kind of harm or injury as contemplated
but the precise harm or injury was different or occurred in a different way,
unless the actual result is too remote or accidental to have a bearing on the
offender’s liability or on the gravity of the offense.
   (C)   If negligently causing a particular result is an element of an offense
and the result is not within the risk of which the offender is aware or should
be aware, either element can nevertheless be established if:
      (1)   The actual result differs from the probable result only in the
respect that a different person or different property is affected or that the
actual injury or harm is less; or
      (2)   The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the
probable result, unless the actual result is too remote or accidental to have a
bearing on the offender’s liability or on the gravity of the offense.
(1992 Code, § 8-1-102)
§ 6-2-17 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CONDUCT OF ANOTHER.
   A person is responsible for conduct which is an element of an offense if the
conduct is either that of the person himself or herself or that of another and
he or she is legally accountable for such conduct.
(1992 Code, § 8-1-103)
§ 6-2-18 WHEN ACCOUNTABILITY EXISTS.
   A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:
   (A)   Having a mental state described by the statute defining the offense,
he or she causes another to perform the conduct, regardless of the legal
capacity or mental state of the other person;
   (B)   The statute defining the offense makes him or her so accountable; or
   (C)   Either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose
to promote or facilities such commission, he or she solicits, aids, abets,
agrees or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of
the offense. However, a person is not so accountable if:
      (1)   He or she is a victim of the offense committed, unless the statute
defining the offense provides otherwise; or
      (2)   Before the commission of the offense, he or she terminates his or
her effort to promote or facilities such commission and does one of the
following:
         (a)   Wholly deprives his or her prior efforts to effectiveness in
such commission;
         (b)   Gives timely warning to the proper law enforcement authorities;
or
         (c)   Otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the
offense.
(1992 Code, § 8-1-104)
§ 6-2-19 SEPARATE CONVICTION OF PERSON ACCOUNTABLE.
   A person who is legally accountable for the conduct of another which is an
element of an offense may be convicted upon proof that the offense was
committed and that he or she was so accountable although the other person
claimed to have committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted has
been convicted of different offense, is not amenable to justice, or has been
acquitted.
(1992 Code, § 8-1-105)
§ 6-2-20 CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY OF CORPORATIONS.
   (A)   A corporation may be persecuted for the commission of an offense if,
but only if:
      (1)   The offense is a misdemeanor and which clearly indicates a
legislative purpose to impose liability on a corporation and an agent of the
corporation performs the conduct which is an element of the offense while
acting within the scope of his or her office or employment in behalf of the
corporation; except that, any limitation in the defining statute concerning the
corporation’s accountability for certain agents or under certain circumstances
is applicable; or
      (2)   The commission of the offense is authorized, requested, commanded
or performed by the board of directors or by a high managerial agent who is
acting within the scope of his or her employment in behalf of the corporation.
   (B)   A corporation’s proof that the high managerial agent having
supervisory responsibility over the conduct which is the subject matter of the
offense exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the offense is a
defense to a prosecution for any offense to which division (A)(1) above refers,

§ 10-1-11 NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   The lawful uses of land, existing at the time of the adoption of this
chapter, although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof, may be
continued, but if such non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of six
months, any future use of said premises shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. A landowner may seek to extend this six-month time
period where an undue hardship exists through an appeal to the Board of
Adjustment.
   (B)   A variance may be granted to allow development on a lot that exists at
the time of adoption or revision of this chapter where reasonable development
cannot conform to yard setback or lot coverage requirements due to substandard
size of the lot.
   (C)   When a district shall hereafter be changed, any then existing non-
conforming use in such changed district may be continued.
(1992 Code, § 9-1-111)
§ 10-1-12 EXCEPTIONS TO HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Ordinary exceptions. This chapter shall not be deemed to limit or
restrict the height of belfries, chimneys, church steeples, clock towers,

buildings, but these structures shall be subject to such restrictions and
regulations as may be imposed by other ordinances.
   (B)   Restricted exceptions. Churches, public or semi-public buildings,
hospitals, schools, colleges and private clubs may exceed the height
restrictions of the district in which they are constructed; provided, such
structures shall have side yards on both sides, complying with the area
regulations of the district and, in addition, the side yards shall be increased
one foot in width for each five feet that the height of the building exceeds
the height regulation of the district.
(1992 Code, § 9-1-112)
§ 10-1-13 EXCEPTIONS TO AREA REGULATIONS.
   Where churches, schools, hospitals or colleges are located in any “A” or “B”
Residential District and have no portion used as a place for habitation, the
depth of the rear yard may be reduced to six feet. The front, side and rear
yards shall be waived where dwellings are erected above stores, shops or other
commercial uses. No lot area shall at any time be so reduced or diminished that
the front, rear or side yards shall be smaller than prescribed by this chapter.
(1992 Code, § 9-1-113)
§ 10-1-14 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Building in district boundaries. The boundaries of districts are shown
on the map on display in the office of the City Clerk and of the Zoning
Officer. All changes in zoning will be shown on revised map on display in the
office of the City Clerk and of the Zoning Officer. Such map is hereby adopted
and made a part of this code.
   (B)   Change in district boundaries, regulations and restrictions. Changes
in the boundaries of any district or part thereof or changes of regulations or
restrictions within any such district may be made by the City Council. The City
Council shall use the following procedure when altering or establishing zoning
district regulations and/or boundaries.
      (1)   A petition requesting such change shall first be presented to the
City Council, duly signed by the owners of 35% or more, either of the area of
the lots included within such change or of the lots immediately adjacent in the
area thereof, extending 300 feet from the street frontage of such opposite
lots. In the case of corner lots, the petitioners shall be owners of property
along each street frontage.
      (2)   Such petition shall be referred to the Board of Adjustment which
shall make a careful investigation of such proposed change and file a written
report thereon within 30 days after the same has been referred. The City
Council shall thereupon cause notice to be published twice in a paper of
general circulation within the city of the time and place set for the hearing
upon such petition and report. The publication of such notice shall be made at
least 15 days prior to the time of such hearing. At such hearing, the City
Council shall hear all persons and all objections and recommendations relative
to such proposed change and thereupon, action shall be taken upon such petition
by said City Council and such action shall be final and conclusive as to all
matters and things involved in said petition.
      (3)   Provided, however, that, if written protest against such change
signed by the owners of 25% or more, either of the area of the lots included in
such proposed change or, of those within 300 feet of the area proposed for
change, such amendment shall not become effective, except by the favorable vote
of three-fourths of all the members of the City Council.
      (4)   When such proposed amendment has been rejected by the City Council,
neither it, nor one involving only the same property, shall be offered for
adoption within one year after such rejection.
      (5)   Changes in the regulations and restrictions in any district may be
made from time to time by the City Council in the same manner as is prescribed
in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(4) above for making changes in the boundaries;
except that, such action may be initiated without the presentation of a
petition requesting it.
(1992 Code, § 9-1-114)
§ 10-1-15 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Enforcement.
      (1)   This chapter shall be enforced by the Zoning Officer, his or her
assistants or other duly appointed officer of the city, subject to such
variations and interpretations which may be made by the Board of Adjustment.
Appeal of any decision of the enforcing officer may be made to the Board of
Adjustment as provided in the laws of the State of Montana.
      (2)   A zoning conformance permit shall be issued by the enforcing
officer before any building, or premises, or part thereof may hereafter be
created, erected, changed or converted, wholly or in part, in its use or
structure, to the effect that such building and use proposed therefor conform
to the provisions of this chapter. These certificates shall be applied for and
issued at the same time, or before, the Building Inspector grants a building
permit for the premises.
      (3)   It shall be unlawful to allow any basement excavations upon which a
building is not constructed to be left unfilled, uncovered, if construction of
intended building is not started upon said excavation within 60 days of
excavation, and worked on continuously until completed. If construction on said
excavation is not completed within 180 days of excavation, the City Zoning
Officer shall order the excavation to be filled in.
      (4)   No person shall move or demolish a building within the city limits
without first obtaining a permit from the Zoning Officer. Where buildings have
been removed or demolished, the ground shall be leveled and all debris removed.
   (B)   Penalty for violation. Any person, firm or corporation owning,
controlling or managing any building or premises wherein or whereon there shall
be placed, or there exists anything in violation to the provisions of this
chapter; or any person, firm or corporation who shall assist in the commission
of any violation of this chapter, or who shall build contrary to the plans and
specifications submitted to, and approved by, the Zoning Officer; or any
person, form or corporation who shall omit, neglect or refuse to do any act
required in this chapter, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than $250, nor more than $500, for
each offense, or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 90 days, or by both
such fine and imprisonment. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist
shall constitute a separate offense.
   (C)   Procedure in the case of non-conformity.
      (1)   If, on any inspection, the use of a premises is found not to
conform to the requirements of this chapter, or the conditions of an existing
certificate therefore, the Zoning Officer or other duly appointed official
shall at once issue written notice to the owner, specifying the manner in which
the use of the premises fails to so conform and the owner shall, at once, take
steps to make it so conform or file a written notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof, both with the Zoning Officer and the Board of Adjustment,
within 48 hours following receipt of notice of non-conforming use by the Zoning
Officer. If necessary for the proper protection of the occupants, he or she
shall order the use or premises vacated until its condition is made
satisfactory and in conformity with the requirements of this chapter, at which
time a certificate will be issued as herein provided for new buildings or for
the use of premises.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as issue notice to the
parties in interest, and decide the same within 15 days following the date
notice of appeal was filed.
   (D)   Interpretation and purpose.
      (1)   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare.
      (2)   It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with, or abrogate
or annul rules or permits previously adopted or issued according to the law
relating to the use of buildings or premises, nor to interfere with, abrogate
or annul any easement, covenants or agreements between parties; provided,
however, that, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions as to use, or
requires larger open spaces or less height than are required by such rules or
permits or by easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this
chapter shall control.
   (E)   Enforcement and remedies. In case any building or structure is
erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or
maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this
chapter, the City Council, in addition to other remedies, may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or
use, to retrain, correct, structure or land or to prevent any illegal act,
conduct, business or use in or about such premises.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 11-1-1 FLOODPLAIN HAZARD MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.
   These regulations are known and may be cited as the “Floodplain Hazard
Management Regulations”; hereinafter referred to as “these regulations”.
(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)
§ 11-1-2 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Floodplain and floodway management is incorporated in MCA Title 76,
Ch. 5, and describes the authority, procedures and minimum standards for local
regulations.
   (B)   The authority to regulate development in specifically identified flood
hazard areas is granted to communities by MCA 76-5-301 and municipalities have
authority to adopt regulations as provided for in MCA 7-1-4123 to promote the
general public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)
§ 11-1-3 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Flood hazard areas specifically adopted herein as regulated flood
hazard areas have been delineated and designated by the Department of Natural
Resources and Conservation (DNRC) and/or the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) pursuant to MCA 76-5-201.
   (B)   The proposed regulations have been reviewed and approved by the
Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to meet the prescribed minimum standard for
development and procedures.
(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)
§ 11-1-4 PURPOSE.
   (A)   These regulations promote public health, safety and general welfare of
the residents and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
regulated flood hazard areas.
   (B)   These regulations are intended to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business and public service interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
disruptions; and
      (7)   Ensure compliance with the minimum standards for the continued
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program for the benefit of the
residents.
(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)
§ 11-1-5 METHODS TO REDUCE LOSSES.
   These regulations are intended to reduce flood losses through the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or that may cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses of land vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities, be developed or constructed to at least minimum standards or to
otherwise minimize flood damage;
   (C)   Regulate the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are needed to accommodate flood waters;
   (D)   Regulate filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
impact other land, flood water depth or velocity of flood waters;
   (F)   Distinguish between the land use regulations applied to the floodway
within the regulated flood hazard area and those applied to that portion of the
regulated flood hazard area not contained in the floodway;
   (G)   Apply more restrictive land use regulations within the floodway of the
regulated flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that regulations and minimum standards balance the greatest
public good with the least private injury.
(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)
§ 11-1-6 JURISDICTIONAL AREA.
   (A)   These regulations apply only to the flood hazard areas specifically
adopted herein as regulated flood hazard areas and are more fully and
specifically described in §§
11-1-45 through
11-1-47 of this chapter. The requirements and approvals for alterations to the
specific jurisdictional area are in §§
11-1-45 through
11-1-47 of this chapter as well. Areas within the regulated flood hazard area
also include areas specifically identified, labeled and illustrated on maps as
floodway or flood fringe that have differing uses allowed and minimum building
standards that apply. The jurisdictional areas are those areas of the 100-year
floodplain illustrated and depicted in the referenced studies and maps.
   (B)   The regulated flood hazard area supporting study and maps illustrating
the regulatory area are generally studies and maps completed for the DNRC by
FEMA or the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) that have been
adopted by DNRC pursuant to MCA 76-5-201 et seq. The regulated flood hazard
area may include those areas collectively identified as special flood hazard
areas by FEMA on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and are those areas subject to flood
hazard caused by the 100-year flood. FEMA also utilizes the maps of special
flood hazard areas and accompanying flood insurance studies for determining
flood risk for National Flood Insurance premiums. The maps and accompanying
study becomes the regulatory flood hazard area only when formally adopted by
DNRC and community within an ordinance.
(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)

§ 11-1-16 LAND DIVISIONS AND SUBDIVISION REVIEW.
   (A)   Any land divisions and subdivision approval including new or expansion
of existing manufactured home parks within the regulated flood hazard area must
be designed to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   The base flood elevations and boundary of the regulated flood
hazard area are determined and considered during lot layout and building
location design;
      (2)   Locations for future structures and development are reasonably safe
from flooding;
      (3)   Adequate surface water drainage is provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazards;
      (4)   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;
and
      (5)   For development within the regulated flood hazard area, permits
according to these regulations must be obtained before development occurs.
   (B)   The NFIP program standard for community floodplain management
ordinances specifies that the local government is to consider flood hazards
when reviewing and approving subdivisions within the special flood hazard area.
Floodplain Administrators should check their subdivision ordinances to ensure
flood hazards outside of regulated flood hazard areas are addressed in
development proposals. For example, the montana model subdivision regulations
suggests that any portion of a proposed subdivision is within 2,000 horizontal
feet and 20 vertical feet of a stream draining an area of 25 square miles or
more, where no official floodplain studies of the stream have been made, the
subdivider may be required to conduct a flood hazard evaluation study. The
Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation may, if requested,
review the flood hazard analysis on the merit of its technical adequacy and
make a recommendation back to the Floodplain Administrator.

permit may be necessary before repair or reconstruction commences on structures
that:
      (1)   Have sustained 30% or more in flood damages;
      (2)   Have been swept away;
      (3)   Have one or more collapsed or missing walls;
      (4)   Cannot be reoccupied without major structural work; or
      (5)   Have sustained more than two feet of water over the first floor.
   (B)   Structures that have suffered substantial damage or will undergo
substantial improvements require a floodplain application and permit and must
be upgraded to meet the minimum building standards herein during repair or
reconstruction.
   (C)   Floodplain Administrators coordinate assistance and provide
information to structure owners concerning Hazard Mitigation and Recovery
measures with Federal Emergency Management Agency, Montana Department of
Natural Resources and Conservation, and other state, local and private
emergency service organizations.

regulations vary by the specific areas identified as floodway and flood fringe.
(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)
§ 11-1-46 INTERPRETATION OF REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREA BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   The mapped boundaries illustrated in the referenced studies in this
section are a guide for determining whether property is within the regulated
flood hazard area.
   (B)   A determination of the outer limits and boundaries of the regulated
flood hazard area or the flood fringe and floodway within the regulated flood
hazard area includes an evaluation of the maps as well as the particular study
data of the referenced study in this section.
   (C)   Boundary points of the regulated flood hazard area may be illustrated
for guidance on reference maps, but the boundary is the actual intersection of
the applicable base flood elevation with the natural adjacent terrain of the
watercourse or channel.
   (D)   The floodway boundary is as illustrated on the referenced maps and
studies.
   (E)   Any owner or lessee of property who believes his property has been
inadvertently included in the regulated flood hazard area may submit scientific
and/or technical information to the Floodplain Administrator. Changes to the
National Flood Insurance Rate Maps for the National Flood Insurance Program
through a FEMA letter of map change process are the responsibility of the owner
or lessee.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator may require elevation information
provided by an engineer or land surveyor or other information as needed for any
development that may be considered to be subject to these regulations. The

(Ord. 2013-01, passed 1-30-2013)
§ 11-1-47 ALTERATION OF JURISDICTIONAL AREA.
   (A)   An alteration in this paragraph is a change to the existing boundary
to the specific maps and data of the referenced studies in this section that
form the basis for the regulated flood hazard area.
   (B)   An alteration may be the result of new data and information or when
technical or scientific flood data show that the base flood elevation has or
may be changed or was erroneously established and the boundaries of the
regulated flood hazard area are incorrect.
   (C)   Any alteration must be based on reasonable hydrological certainty.
   (D)   Any alteration or proposed alteration of one-half feet or more in the
base flood elevation requires approval of the DNRC in addition to an amendment
of the adopted jurisdictional map.
   (E)   Any additional notices or approvals required by FEMA for the purpose
of updating flood insurance rate maps of changes as a result of permitted
activity that cause any change in topography by fill or changes in the base
flood elevation is the responsibility of the permit applicant. The Floodplain
Administer may represent any necessary approvals or endorsements by the permit
authority to FEMA.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
alterations.
   (G)   An alteration is not required when property located within the
regulated flood hazard area is shown to be naturally above the base flood
elevation.
   (H)   Except in a flood fringe, alteration approval from DNRC is required if
property is to be raised to a level above the base flood elevation by suitable
fill and where the encroachment by the fill causes a rise in the base flood
elevation of more than one-half feet. No portion of the fill may be within the
floodway.
   (I)   No alteration of a regulated flood hazard area is required when
property located within the regulated flood hazard area is elevated with fill
to at or above the base flood elevation and is permitted.
   (J)   When property located within the regulated flood hazard area is
naturally above the base flood elevation as proven by a certified elevation
survey provided by an engineer or land surveyor, the property owner may be
required to submit a letter of map change (LOMA) to FEMA in order to affect the
flood risk designation for insurance purposes. Information on the process and
requirements are available through FEMA.
   (K)   Alteration of the floodplain usually requires FEMA approval for
modification to their FEMA Insurance Rate Maps and may require preapproval by
conditional letter of map revision, and/ or letter of map revision or other map
change approvals in addition to approval from the Floodplain Administrator and
DNRC.

   (B)   Special considerations for variance approval.
      (1)   If the new construction or substantial improvements on a lot of
one-half acres or less is contiguous to and surrounded by lots of existing
structures constructed below the base flood elevation, a variance may be
approved. However, as lot sizes increase beyond one-half acre additional
technical justification may be required.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum relief necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
