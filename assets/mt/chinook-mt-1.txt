PREFACE
   The Chinook Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing in 1975,
has been kept current by regular supplementation.
   During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction
of Stuart MacKenzie, city attorney.
   The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus,
Section
17.12.050 is Section .050, located in
Chapter 17.12 of Title 17. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens
(.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original
sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are
numbered to provide for internal expansion.
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the
specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history
is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the
code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear
in the codification.
   A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific
code provisions by individual section numbers.
   This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance 533, which
passed May 9, 2023.

driveways.
   A.   Concrete Sidewalks. All new sidewalk construction to be located on city
right-of-way shall be constructed to a four-inch minimum depth on a thoroughly
watered and rolled subgrade. The subgrade shall be compacted to a field density
of ninety percent of maximum laboratory density. All sidewalks shall have a
standard width of 5.0 feet. Any sidewalks constructed with a different width
shall be approved by the city's public works director prior to construction.
   B.   Concrete Driveways.
      1.   All new concrete driveway construction to be located on city right-
of-way shall be constructed to a six-inch minimum depth on a thoroughly watered
and rolled subgrade. The subgrade shall be compacted to a field density of
ninety-five percent of maximum laboratory density. Welded wire mesh (6x6 10/10)
shall be placed in the concrete driveway slab.
      2.   Where there is an existing curb which must be removed, the curb
shall be cut with a cement power saw at the point the remaining curb adjoins
the new driveway. The joint where the remaining curb joins the new driveway
shall be connected with dowling of one-half-inch rebar and not less than six
inches in length. The driveway will be designed in a manner in which the gutter
elevation and slope will not be changed and drainage and flow of water will not
be impeded or reduced. In addition, driveway plans shall be furnished by the
applicant at the time of obtaining permit.
   C.   Materials. Class DD Portland cement concrete shall be utilized. This
class of concrete includes the following mix design:
      Maximum aggregate size   3/4 in.
      Minimum concrete content (94 lb. bag)   5.5 sacks/cy
      Minimum required 7-day compressive strength   3,000 lb/sq.in.
      Maximum water content per bag   6.0 gal.
      Slump   1-1/2 to 3 in.
      Required air content   5 to 7 percent
   D.   Erecting Forms. Forms, either of wood or steel, shall be staked
securely in place, true to line and grade. Sufficient support shall be given to
the form to prevent movement in any direction resulting from the weight of the
concrete or the concrete placement. Forms shall not be set until the subgrade
has been compacted within one inch of the established grade. Forms shall be
clean and well oiled prior to setting in place. Immediately prior to placing
the concrete, forms shall be inspected by the public works director for proper
grading, alignment and rigid construction. Adjustments and repairs as needed
shall be completed before placing concrete.
   E.   Placing Concrete. The subgrade shall be graded, compacted and dampened
prior to the placement of the concrete. Concrete shall be spaded and tamped
thoroughly into the forms to provide a dense, compacted concrete free of rock
pockets. The exposed surfaces shall be floated, finished and broomed.
   F.   Stripping Forms and Finishing.
      1.   Forms may be removed on the day following the pour if the concrete
is sufficiently set so that removal will be without danger of chipping or
spalling. When forms are removed before the expiration of the curing period,
the edges of the concrete shall be protected with moist earth, or sprayed with
a curing compound.
      2.   Concrete shall be worked until the coarse aggregate is forced down
into the body of the concrete and no coarse aggregate is exposed. The surface
shall then be floated with a wooden float to a smooth and uniform surface. When
the concrete has hardened sufficiently, the surface shall be given a broom
finish. The broom shall be of an approved type. The strokes shall be square
across the concrete from edge to edge with adjacent strokes overlapped. Strokes
shall be made without tearing the concrete. The broomed finish shall produce
regular corrugations not over one-eighth inch in depth.
   G.   Protection and Curing.
      1.   Concrete shall be protected from the loss of moisture as soon as
possible after placement, and this protection shall be continued for a period
of at least three days. This protection shall consist of some type of water
cure, either by ponding, sprinkling, wet sand or earth, or wet burlap, whenever
possible. Where water curing is impossible, approved curing compounds may be
substituted therefor. On vertical surfaces, forms should be left in place as
long as practical and consistent with construction schedules to retain moisture
in the concrete.
      2.   When the low temperatures are expected to drop below freezing and/or
the temperatures of the day are expected to remain below forty degrees F, the
concrete shall be enclosed and protected in such a way that the air surrounding
the fresh concrete can be kept at a temperature of not less than sixty degrees
F for a period of three days, and above freezing for an additional three days.
Under extremely cold conditions, heating equipment may be required, in addition
to housing and covering. When heating is necessary to maintain proper curing
temperatures, moisture should be introduced to prevent excessive drying of the
concrete. At the termination of the heating period, care should be taken to see
that a sudden drastic change in the temperature of the concrete does not take
place.
   H.   Transverse expansion joints one-half-inch thick shall be provided at
all sidewalk returns and opposite expansion joints in the adjacent curb. Where
curbs are not adjacent, expansion joints shall be installed at intervals of
fifty feet. Expansion joints shall also be installed where sidewalks about any
rigid structure such as curbs, buildings, driveways, etc. Expansion joint
material shall consist of bituminous preformed joint filler conforming to AASHO
Designation M33 and shall be installed to the full depth of the sidewalk or
driveway. Construction joints shall be formed in the fresh concrete and shall
be located every five feet.

11.04.043   Permits required.
   Prior to the installation or repair of sidewalks or driveways located on
city right-of-way, the property owner shall first obtain a permit from the
city. The fee for said permit shall be ten dollars.

within the city limits is in such a condition of disrepair or broken up so as
to constitute a danger or hazard to persons traveling over the same, and he
determines that such sidewalk or curb must be replaced or repaired, he shall
give notice to the owner of such lots or premises adjoining such sidewalk or
curb stating the particular place or places where such sidewalk is to be
repaired or replaced.

protect, preserve, and maintain public health, safety, and welfare.
   B.   Definitions.
      “Emergency water restriction” shall mean any situation when insufficient
water is available to meet the present or anticipated needs of the city and its
water users. An emergency restriction may be imposed in times of drought, low
water, or a major infrastructure failure.
      “Person” means any individual, corporation, business, partnership,
association, or other entity receiving water from the municipal supply.
      “Water user” means all persons using water from the city water supply.
   C.   Restriction requirements. Upon its declaration of an emergency water
restriction, the city shall be authorized to determine and implement certain
restrictions necessary to conserve and maintain adequate reserves of the public
water supply. In the event there is a declaration, the following levels of
restriction will apply immediately after the public is notified of the
restriction as set forth below.
      1.   If the city issues a Stage 1 restriction, then:
         Water users with addresses ending with an odd number (such as 737
Indiana, 511 North Ohio or 315 West 5th Street, for example) shall only operate
their lawn and garden sprinklers, whether automatic or manual, on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday. Water users with on even-numbered address shall only
operate their lawn and garden sprinklers, whether automatic or manual, on
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. There shall be no use of lawn or garden
sprinklers on Sunday. There shall be no restriction on hand watering under a
Stage 1 declaration.
      2.   If the city issues a Stage 2 restriction, then:
         Only hand watering, or watering from a can or bucket, shall be
allowed. No water user shall operate any sprinkler system, automatic or
otherwise, on lawn or garden.
      3.   If the city issues a Stage 3 restriction, then:
         There shall be no outside water use, which means no watering of lawns
or gardens, no washing or spraying of streets, sidewalks, driveways, parking
lots, porches, patios, or verandas, no filling of swimming pools, ponds, hot
tubs, spas, or decorative fountains, and no washing of cars, trucks, or boats
except at a commercial business engaged in car, truck, and boat washing.
   D.   Exceptions to restrictions. There shall be no restriction on water
necessary to sustain “animal life”, which is defined as animals allowed by
ordinance to be in the city, such as dogs and cats. There shall also be no
restriction on uses of water originating from sources other than the municipal
water supply. There shall be no restriction of water for firefighting.
   E.   Notification. Notification of an emergency water restriction shall be
made as follows:
      1.   By conspicuously posting the declaration in at least two public
places; and
      2.   Advertising the declaration on public radio; and
      3.   Publishing notice of the declaration in a newspaper of general
circulation within the city.
      4.   In addition to the above methods, the city may provide public
notification by other means reasonably determined to notify all water users of
the restriction.
   F.   Termination. Upon a determination that the emergency water restriction
no longer exists, the city may terminate the declaration of restriction. Public
notification of the termination shall be given in accordance with division E.
   G.   Enforcement and non-criminal penalties. The city is authorized to
enforce this section. Any person failing to comply with the restrictions
imposed under this section shall be subject to the following civil penalties:
      1.   First violation. The city shall provide a written warning. Written
notification of the violation shall be left with the water user or left upon
the premises in a conspicuous location reasonably determined to be found by the
water user, such as hung or attached on the door of the residence or business.
The notice shall be sufficient if it explains the violation in general terms
and sets forth the penalty for a subsequent violation within the same period of
restriction.
      2.   Second violation. A second violation within the same period of
restriction shall result in a civil penalty of $25.
      3.   Third and subsequent violations. Third and subsequent violations
within the same period of restriction shall result in a civil penalty of not
less than $50 and not more than $300.
   H.   Collection alternative. In the event civil penalties imposed under
division G. are not collected by the court, the city may assess, charge, and
bill the water user, on its monthly water bill, the amount of the civil penalty
imposed.

   The purpose of this chapter shall be to generate sufficient revenue to pay
all costs for the administration, debt repayment, operation and maintenance of
the complete wastewater system.
   The costs shall be distributed to all users of the wastewater system in
proportion to each user's contribution to the total loading of the loading of
the treatment works.
   Factors such as strength (BOD and SS), volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user's
contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of the wastewater system's
costs to each user.
(Ord. 382 § 1, 1983).
13.40.020   Determination of total annual cost.
   The city shall determine the total annual costs of the wastewater system
which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance, during the
service life of the sewer system, for which such systems were designed and
constructed.
   The total annual cost shall include but need not be limited to, debt
repayment, labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary
modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests, and a reasonable contingency
fund.
(Ord. 382 § 2, 1983).
13.40.030   Wastewater facilities replacement fund established.
   A reserve fund called the wastewater facilities replacement fund is
established within the wastewater utility fund for the purpose of providing
sufficient funds to be expended for obtaining and selling equipment,
accessories and appurtenances during the useful life (twenty years) of the
wastewater treatment facilities necessary to maintain the capacity and
performance for which such facilities are designed and constructed.
   (See paragraph 2A of Appendix A, attached to the ordinance codified in this
chapter.) (Ord. 399 § 1, 1986: Ord. 382 § 2(a), 1983).
13.40.040   Average daily volume—Assessment calculations .
   The city shall determine each user's average daily volume of wastewater
discharged to the wastewater system by utilizing water meter readings taken for
either one or a series of months during the winter period (December to March)
as deemed appropriate by the city council. Sewer assessments shall then be
calculated based on these meter readings and in accordance with the procedures
outlined in Appendix A, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter.
   The amount of infiltration and inflow into the system shall be excluded from
the assessment calculations.
(Ord. 382 § 3, 1983).
13.40.050   Surcharge rate for above-normal-strength wastes.
   The city shall determine the average suspended solids (SS) and biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average user. The city shall assess
a surcharge rate for all users discharging wastes with BOD and SS strengths
greater than the average user.
   Such users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the costs of
treating such users' above-normal-strength wastes. Normal-strength wastes are
considered to be one hundred eightysix ppm BOD and two hundred sixtythree ppm
SS. The surcharge rate structure for such above-normal-strength waste
dischargers shall be calculated according to the procedures outlined in
Appendix B, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter.
(Ord. 382 § 4, 1983) .
13.40.060   How billed—Penalty for late payment.

wastewater service charge or one-twelfth of the user's annual wastewater
service charge may be included with the monthly water billing.
   The city shall add a penalty of ten percent per month if the payment is not
received by the city within fifteen days.
   Should any user fail to pay the user wastewater service charge and penalty
within three months of the due date, the city may stop the wastewater service
to the property.
(Ord. 382 § 5, 1983).
13.40.070   Review of annual cost—Revision.
   The city shall review the total annual wastewater system cost as well as
each user's wastewater contribution every year and will revise the system as
necessary to assure equity of the service charge system established in this
chapter and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate
and maintain the wastewater system.
   If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant
modifications which would change that user's wastewater contribution, the user
can present at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body such factual
information, and the city shall then determine if the user's wastewater
contribution is to be changed.
   The city shall notify the user of its findings as soon as possible.
(Ord. 382 § 6, 1983).
13.40.080   Annual notification of attributable charges .

13.40.090—13.40.110
13.40.090   Discharge of waters creating a hazard prohibited.
   The discharge of any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or
gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to contaminate the sludge of any municipal systems, or to injure or
interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in or have an adverse
effect on the waters receiving any discharge from the treatment works is
prohibited.
   (Articles II and V of the city's regulation of sewer use ordinance (
Chapter 13.28) contain additional requirements covering the use of the city's
public sewers.) Also, each user who discharges any toxic pollutants that cause
an increase in the cost of managing the effluent of the sludge of the city's
treatment works shall pay for such increased costs on a proportionate basis.
(Ord. 382 § 8, 1983).
13.40.100   Prohibited connections.
   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation
drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to
building sewers or building drains which in turn are connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
(Ord. 382 § 9, 1983).
13.40.110   Sanitary sewers and sewer connections-Conformance with city and

chapter, there is hereby created and established within the airport influence
area, an airport impact zone and a limited development area zone which includes
all of the land lying within the boundaries and zones defined on the respective
airport, "airport influence area" drawings and exhibits. The zones are shown on
the respective airport, "airport influence area" drawings and exhibits
consisting of one sheet, prepared by the Blaine County airport board and dated
June 2, 2003, which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and
made a part hereof. The drawings and exhibits referenced herein are available
for review and inspection at the office of the city clerk, Chinook, Montana.
The various land uses are hereby established and defined as follows:

MCA.
(Ord. 494 § 4, 2003).
17.40.050    Use restrictions.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, no use may be made of land or water within the airport influence area
or any zone established by the ordinance codified in this chapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
creating bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere
with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the
airport.
(Ord. 494 § 5, 2003).
17.40.060   Nonconforming uses.
   Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by the ordinance
codified in this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal or other
change or alteration of any structure not conforming to the regulations as of
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein
shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of
any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and is diligently
prosecuted.
(Ord. 494 § 6, 2003).
17.40.070    Permits.
   A. Future Uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, in any zone hereby created
unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each
application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the resulting use would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such
determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for
a use inconsistent with the provisions of the ordinance codified in this
chapter shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
subsection D of this section.
   B.   Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow a
nonconforming use to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any amendments
thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as
indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Blaine County
airport board determines that a nonconforming use has been abandoned, no permit
shall be granted that would allow such use to deviate from the zoning
regulations without submitting an application to the board of adjustment for a
variance.
   D.   Variances. Any person desiring to use property, not in accordance with
the regulations prescribed in the ordinance codified in this chapter, may apply
to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The
application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
air space. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public
interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of the ordinance codified in
this chapter. An application for variance to the requirements of the ordinance

17.44.030   Airport zones.
   In order to carry out the provisions of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include
all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces,
horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Chinook Airport,
Harlem Airport, Turner Airport and Hogeland Airport. Such zones are shown on
the respective airport airspace drawings and exhibits consisting of one sheet,
prepared by the Blaine County airport board and dated June 2, 2003. The
drawings and exhibits referenced herein are available for review and inspection
at the office of the city clerk, Chinook, Montana. An area located in more than
one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with more
restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:
   "Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone" (Hogeland Airport) . The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two
hundred fifty feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width
of one thousand, two hundred fifty feet at a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of
the centerline of the runway.
   "Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone." The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five
hundred feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
two thousand feet at a horizontal distance five thousand feet from the primary
surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   "Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zone." The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five
hundred feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
one thousand, five hundred feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet
from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline
of the runway.
   "Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum Greater Than Three

coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred feet wide.
The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of three thousand, five
hundred feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand feet from the primary
surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   "Transitional Zones." The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
   "Horizontal Zone." The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs from
the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the
adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of arc is:
      1.   Five thousand feet for all runways designated utility or visual;
      2.   Ten thousand feet for all others.
   The radius of the arc for each end of the runway shall be the same. The
radius used shall be the longest determined for either end. The horizontal zone
does not include the approach and transitional zones.
   "Conical Zone." The conical zone is established as the area that commences
at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a
horizontal distance of four thousand feet.
(Ord. 495 § 3, 2003).
17.44.040   Airport zone height limitations.
   Except as otherwise provided in the ordinance codified in this chapter, no
structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be
allowed to grow in any zone created by the ordinance codified in this chapter
to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for
such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each
of the zones in question as follows:
   A.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone (Hogeland Airport). Slopes twenty
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet along the extended runway centerline.
   B.   Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes twenty
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet along the extended runway centerline.
   C.   Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zone. Slopes twenty feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand
feet along the extended runway centerline.
   D.   Runway Larger than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater than Three
Fourths Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone (Chinook Airport, Harlem
Airport, Turner Airport). Slopes thirty four feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand feet along the extended
runway centerline.
   E.   Transitional Zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above
the airport elevation, which is two thousand, six hundred feet above, mean sea
level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits
sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and
at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they
intersect the conical surface.
   F.   Horizontal Zone. Established at one hundred fifty feet above the
airport elevation.
   G.   Conical Zone. Slopes twenty feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty feet above the
airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred fifty feet above
the airport elevation.
   H.   Excepted Height Limitations. Nothing in the ordinance codified in this
chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of
any structure, or growth of any tree to a height up to fifty feet above the
surface of the land except within the approach zone where it would penetrate
any of the surfaces identified.
(Ord. 495 § 4, 2003).
17.44.050    Use restrictions.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by the
ordinance codified in this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical
interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the
airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the
airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike
hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing,
takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
(Ord. 495 § 5, 2003).
17.44.060    Nonconforming uses.
   A.   Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by the
ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be construed to require the
removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not
conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a
nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted.
   B.   Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Blaine County airport
board to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport
the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Blaine County airport
board.
(Ord. 495 § 6, 2003).
17.44.070   Permits.
   A.   Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (A)(1) and
(A)(2) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been
applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the
purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to
permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with
the provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be granted
unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection D of this
section.
      1.   In the area lying within the limits of the transitional zone,
horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than seventyfive feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such
tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such
zones.
      2.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than four thousand, two hundred feet from each
end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than seventyfive feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such
tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such
approach zones. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by the ordinance codified in this chapter except as set forth in
subsection
17.44.040(H).
   B.   Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard, to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any amendments
thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as
indicated all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Blaine County
airport board determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than eighty percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to
exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations.
   D.   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in the ordinance codified in this chapter, may
apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The
application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
air space. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public
interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice, and will be . in accordance with the spirit of the ordinance codified
in this chapter. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements
of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered by the board of
adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Blaine
County airport board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance.
If the Blaine County airport board does not respond to the application within
fifteen days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant
or deny said application.
   E.   Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of the ordinance
codified in this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so
conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to
install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and
lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this
condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Blaine County
airport board at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the
necessary markings and lights.
(Ord. 495 § 7, 2003).
17.44.080    Enforcement.
   It shall be the duty of the Blaine County airport board, to administer and
enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and
variances shall be made to the Blaine County airport board upon a form
published for that purpose. Applications required by the ordinance codified in
