   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Boulder City
Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances” or

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.

authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.

NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.

pertaining to subjects not embraced in this code shall remain in full force and

chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

requested. In case of error in extension, the unit price shall prevail.
   (D)   Item-by-item unit price bids must be submitted and will receive
primary consideration for award. All-or-none bids may be submitted as

city.

action, question or dispute has arisen. If the protest is not resolved by
mutual agreement, the City Council shall issue a written decision on the
protest within 30 days after the receipt of the protest. In issuing the final
decision, the decision must state the reason for the action taken by the city
with regard to the contract.
   (C)   DAYS mean calendar days as defined in ARM X.1.201.
(Ord. 173, passed 9-10-2001)
§ 34.12 STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY.

facility and personnel resources and expertise, or the ability to obtain them,
necessary to indicate capability to meet all contractual requirements;
      (2)   Has a satisfactory record of integrity;

solicitation, award or administration of a contract ordinances, policies or
procedures of the city.

responsibility standards for a particular procurement, provided that these
additional standards are set forth in the solicitation, or from using past
performance with the city as a reference.
   (C)   A prospective contractor must supply information requested by the City
Administrator concerning the responsibility of the contractor in a timely and
convincing manner. If the contractor fails to supply the requested information,
the city shall base the determination of responsibility upon any available
information or may find the prospective contractor non-responsible.
   (D)   The prospective contractor may demonstrate the availability of
necessary financing, equipment, facilities, expertise and personnel by
submitting upon request:
      (1)   Evidence that the contractor possesses the necessary items;
      (2)   Acceptable plans to subcontract for the necessary items; or
      (3)   A documented commitment from, or explicit arrangement with, a
satisfactory source to provide the necessary items.
   (E)   If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a
contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of non-responsibility
setting forth the basis of the finding must be prepared by the City
Administrator. The determination must be made part of the procurement file and
a copy of the determination mailed to the affected bidder or offeror.
(Ord. 173, passed 9-10-2001)
§ 34.13 SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Specifications shall clearly describe the city’s requirements and
allow for the obtaining of a supply or service which is adequate and suitable
for the city’s needs in a cost effective manner. Specifications may take into
account, to the extent practicable, the costs of ownership and operation as
well as initial acquisition costs and shall permit maximum practicable
competition consistent with this purpose.
   (B)   Specifications shall, to the extent practicable, emphasize functional
or performance criteria and limit design or other detailed physical
descriptions to those necessary to meet the needs of the city. To facilitate
the use of the criteria, the city shall attempt to include as a part of its
requisitions the principal functional or performance needs to be met and any
compatibility requirements.
   (C)   In developing specifications, accepted commercial standards shall be
used and unique requirements shall be avoided, to the extent practicable.
   (D)   Brand name items or descriptions may be used to indicate standards of
quality, performance and/or use desired.
   (E)   Restrictive specifications shall not be used unless no other manner of
description will suffice. In that event, a written determination shall be made
that it is not practicable to use a less restrictive specification.
   (F)   A specification for a specific brand of supplies or services may be
used if the city has a documented need to maintain a standard of performance
and compatibility with existing supplies, equipment or staff experience.
   (G)   The suggested format for specifications is as follows:
      (1)   Name of commodity;
      (2)   Purpose/use for commodity;
      (3)   Description of commodity:
         (a)   Each item of the description should fulfill a functional or
physical requirement;
         (b)   If brand names are necessary to indicate quality levels, list an
acceptable brand name;
         (c)   Justification shall be provided and attached if a single brand
is necessary; and
         (d)   Justification shall be provided and attached if the commodity is
to be a sole source purchase.
      (4)   Description of other requirements, such as warranty, training,
parts, manuals, service and the like;
      (5)   Description of any unusual conditions, such as installation, field
tests, fiscal year funding source and the like;
      (6)   Date commodity is to be delivered;
      (7)   Location where commodity is to be delivered;
      (8)   Name, address and phone number of agency contact person; and
      (9)   Receiving procedures (if testing, sampling or other evaluation will
be performed when commodity is delivered to determine acceptability) must be
described.

§ 34.20 COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSAL.
   (A)   “Competitive sealed proposal” is a procurement option allowing the
award to be based upon an evaluation process using stated criteria to arrive at
a contract that will be the most advantageous to the city.
   (B)   Competitive sealed proposals, solicited through a request for
proposals may be practical when one or more of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The contract needs to be other than a fixed-price type;
      (2)   Oral or written discussions may need to be conducted with offerors
concerning technical and price aspects of their proposal;
      (3)   Offerors may need to be afforded the opportunity to revise their
proposal, including prices;
      (4)   Award may need to be based upon a comparative evaluation as stated
in the request for proposals of differing price, quality and contractual
factors in order to determine the most advantageous offering to the city.
Quality factors include technical and performance capability and the content of
the technical proposal; and/or
      (5)   Price will only be one of several criteria considered in
determining an award, if evaluated at all.
   (C)   The request for proposals must be prepared in accordance with ARM X.l
.601(2) through (4) and must also include:
      (1)   A statement that discussions may be conducted with one or more
offerors who submit proposals, but that proposals may be accepted and a
contract issued without such discussions; and
      (2)   The criteria that will be used to evaluate the proposals.
   (D)   Facsimile transmission of a proposal is only acceptable on an
exception basis with prior approval of the procurement officer.
   (E)   Proposals shall be time-stamped upon receipt and held in a secure
place the City Administrator until the established time.
   (F)   (1)   After the time established for receipt of proposals, the City
Administrator shall open the proposals and inspect the proposals for material
not available for public inspection.
      (2)   The City Administrator will remove this material and then make the
remainder of the proposals available for public inspection. Offerors submitting
a proposal containing a claim to shield confidential information must include a
statement that attests to the offeror’s acceptance of the legal and financial
responsibility for defending the claim. In addition, any claim to shield trade
secret material must be made by an offeror’s legal counsel using the affidavit
form prescribed by the city.
   (G)   For the purpose of conducting discussions, proposals shall be
initially classified as:
      (1)   Responsive; or
      (2)   Non-responsive.
         (a)   Proposals may be found non-responsive any time during the
evaluation process if:
            1.   Any of the required information is not provided; and
            2.   If the submitted price is found to be excessive or inadequate
as measured by criteria stated in the request for proposals.
         (b)   The proposal is not within the plans and specifications
described and required in the request for proposal.
         (c)   Non-responsive proposals will be eliminated from further
consideration.
   (H)   (1)   Discussions may be held with one or more offerors to:
         (a)   Promote understanding of the city’s requirements and the
offerors’ proposals; and
         (b)   Facilitate arriving at a contract that will be most advantageous
to the city taking into consideration all criteria set forth in the request for
proposals.
      (2)   Discussions may include oral presentations, interviews,
demonstrations, responses to specific questions, modifications and
negotiations.
      (3)   At the discretion of the City Council, one or more offerors may be
provided an opportunity to submit a best and final offer if additional
information is required in order to reach a final decision. Unless the request
for proposals so states, a best and final offer may not be requested from the
offeror(s) on price alone.
   (I)   References and the credit and financial responsibility of the offerors
may be verified as appropriate.
   (J)   The evaluation shall be based on the evaluation criteria set forth in
the request for proposals. The evaluators shall exercise discretion in
assigning points or value to a proposal, which involves a judgmental assessment
of the evaluation criteria. The award must be made to the responsive and
responsible offeror whose proposal best meets the evaluation criteria.
   (K)   The City Council reserves the right to negotiate with one or more
offerors for the award of a contract that is most advantageous to the city. The
department reserves the right to award a contract without negotiations or to
reject any or all proposals.
   (L)   Interested parties are responsible for making their own arrangements
to make copies of proposal materials.
   (M)   Multiple award contracts are allowable if determined to be in the best
interest of the city.

§ 34.21 SMALL PURCHASES OR LIMITED SOLICITATIONS OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES.
   (A)   M.C.A. § 7-5-4302 provides, that except as provided in M.C.A. §§ 7-5-
4303 or 7-5-4310, all contracts for the purchase of any automobile, truck,
other vehicle, road machinery, other machinery, apparatus, appliances,
equipment or materials or supplies of any kind in excess of $20,000 or for
construction, repair or maintenance in excess of $25,000 must be let to the
lowest responsible bidder after advertisement for bids. The city may procure
supplies or services below these limits using purchase techniques that best
meets the city’s needs.
   (B)   The limited solicitation procedure must be documented.
   (C)   Procurements shall not be artificially divided or sequenced to avoid

   (A)   The provisions of this rule apply to all sole source procurements of
$5,000 or greater unless exigency procurements described in these ordinances
are necessary.
   (B)   Sole source procurement is not permissible unless a required item is
available from only a single supplier. A requirement for a particular
proprietary item does not justify a sole source procurement if there is more
than one potential bidder or offeror for that item. The following are examples
of circumstances which could necessitate sole source procurement:
      (1)   The compatibility of equipment, accessories or replacement parts is
the paramount consideration; or
      (2)   There is no existent equivalent product.
   (C)   For purchases greater than $5,000, the determination as to whether a
procurement shall be made as a sole source shall be made by the city. In cases
of reasonable doubt, competition should be solicited.
   (D)   The city may conduct negotiations, as appropriate, as to price,
delivery and terms.
   (E)   A record of sole source procurements greater than $5,000 shall be
maintained by the city that lists:
      (1)   Each vendor’s name;
      (2)   The amount and type of each contract;
      (3)   A listing of the supplies or services procured under each contract;
and
      (4)   The identification number of each contract file.
   (F)   The following items do not require sole source justification and shall
be purchased directly by the City Administrator:
      (1)   Licenses;
      (2)   Dues to associations;
      (3)   Renewal of software license agreements; or
      (4)   Purchase or renewal of maintenance agreements for software or
hardware.
(Ord. 173, passed 9-10-2001)
§ 34.23 EXIGENCY PROCUREMENT.
   (A)   An exigency procurement of $5,000 or greater shall be limited to those
supplies or services necessary to meet the exigency.
   (B)   The determination as to whether a procurement shall be made as an
exigency procurement shall be made by the City Administrator. The determination
must be in writing and must state the basis for an exigency procurement and for
the selection of a particular vendor.
   (C)   The procedure used shall be selected to assure that the required
supplies or services are procured in time to meet the exigency. However, such
competition as is practicable shall be obtained.
   (D)   A record of each exigency procurement shall be made as soon as
practicable and shall set forth:
      (1)   The vendor’s name;
      (2)   The amount and type of the contract;
      (3)   A listing of the supplies or services procured under the contract;
and
      (4)   The written documentation required in division (B) above.
(Ord. 173, passed 9-10-2001)
§ 34.24 PROCUREMENT OF USED EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Purchase of used equipment is allowable if in the best interest of the
city.
   (B)   Unless justified as sole source or exigency, the award of the contract
will be made by identifying the requirements and proceeding with the
competitive bidding or proposal process.
   (C)   Criteria to consider in making this determination include:
      (1)   Consideration of the type, use and life expectancy of new versus
used equipment;
      (2)   Comparing the purchase price of new and used equipment;
      (3)   Comparing the price and general condition of used equipment among
several vendors;
      (4)   Consideration of the freight charges and FOB point;
      (5)   Investigation of manufacturer or brand and availability of
warranty, maintenance and parts; and
      (6)   Clarification of payment terms.
(Ord. 173, passed 9-10-2001)
§ 34.25 PROCUREMENT FROM SHELTERED WORKSHOPS OR WORK ACTIVITY CENTERS.
   The city may purchase supplies and services from sheltered workshops as
defined in M.C.A. § 18-5-101. Such purchases are exempt from competitive
bidding laws and rules and may be made directly.
(Ord. 173, passed 9-10-2001)
§ 34.26 AUTHORITY TO DISPOSE OF SUPPLIES.
   The city may not transfer, sell, trade or otherwise dispose of supplies
owned by the city without written authorization of City Council.
(Ord. 173, passed 9-10-2001)
§ 34.27 DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS SUPPLIES.
   (A)   The city may transfer surplus supplies among the several departments
of the city.
   (B)   Surplus supplies must be offered to the public through competitive
sealed bids, public auction, established markets or posted prices.
      (1)   It is recognized, however, that some types and classes of items can
be sold or disposed of more readily and advantageously by other means,
including barter.
      (2)   In such cases and also where the nature of the supply or unusual
circumstances call for its sale to be restricted or controlled, the city may
employ such other means, including appraisal, if the city makes a written
determination that such procedure is advantageous to the city.
      (3)   On sales greater than $300, only United States postal money orders,
certified checks, cashier’s checks or business checks may be accepted.
   (C)   Competitive sealed bidding:
      (1)   If a sale is to be made by competitive sealed bidding, notice of
the sale must be given at least ten days before the date set for opening bids
by:
         (a)   Mailing a request for sale bids to prospective bidders,
including those bidders on lists maintained at the property and supply bureau
for this purpose; and
         (b)   Newspaper advertisement may also be used.
      (2)   The request for sale bids must list the supplies offered for sale;
designate their location and how they may be inspected; and state the terms and
conditions for bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly.
      (3)   Award must be made in accordance with the provisions of the request
for sale bids to the highest responsive and responsible bidder, if the price
offered by such bidder is acceptable to the city. If the price is not
acceptable, the city may:
         (a)   Reject the bids in whole or in part and negotiate the sale, but
the negotiated sale price must be higher than the highest responsive and
responsible bidder’s price; or
         (b)   Resolicit bids.
   (D)   When appropriate, an experienced auctioneer should be used to cry the
sale and assist in preparation of the sale. The solicitation to bidders should
stipulate all the terms and conditions of any sale.
   (E)   Established markets are places where supplies such as livestock and
produce are regularly sold in wholesale lots, and prices are set by open
competition. Surplus supplies may be sold in established markets for such
supplies.
   (F)   Surplus supplies may be sold at posted prices as determined by the
city when such prices are based on fair market value and the sale is conducted
pursuant to written procedures established by the city.
   (G)   Surplus supplies may be traded-in only if the city determines the
trade-in value is expected to equal or exceed the value estimated to be
obtained through the sale or other disposition of the supplies.
   (H)   The city may permit other government units, non-profit organizations
or private businesses to participate in an auction or other appropriate
marketing methods.

IDENTITY THEFT PROGRAM
§ 34.40 ADOPTION.
   (A)   The city recognizes the responsibility to safeguard personal customer
information within the workplace.
   (B)   The creation and implementation of an Identity Theft Prevention
Program will identify, detect, mitigate and update red flags that signal the
possibility of identity theft in connection with the opening of a “covered
account” or any existing “covered account.”
   (C)   This program will utilize guidelines set forth in the Federal Trade

§ 51.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   PERSON. Any individual, partnership, corporation or body politic, and
includes any trustee, receiver, assignee or other similar representative
thereof.
   WATER WELL. Any digging, drilling or excavation, by hand or by the use of
machinery or equipment, whereby water is obtained from under the surface of the
ground to be used on or above the ground surface.
(Ord. 2008-04, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 51.03 RESTRICTIONS.
   No other water well is authorized, except as provided in this chapter.
Except as may be allowed by the express permission of the city, piping from a
water well may not be connected directly or indirectly or cross-connected to
piping connected to the city’s water distribution system.
(Ord. 2008-04, passed 3-10-2008) Penalty, see §
51.99
§ 51.04 AUTHORIZED WELLS.
   (A)   Upon obtaining a well permit pursuant to this chapter, a person may
use a water well within the city limits for the following purposes:
      (1)   Production of manufactured goods, whether or not such goods are
designed for human consumption. Well water used for production of manufactured
goods may not be used for other domestic uses except as otherwise allowed by
this chapter; and
      (2)   Uses not necessitating potable water.
   (B)   A person desiring to install and use a water well shall make
application therefor to the city for a well permit. Any such application shall
contain the following information:
      (1)   Name of applicant;
      (2)   Purpose for which the well and well water are to be used. For
manufacturing uses, a statement of why well water is preferable to city water;
      (3)   A site plan and legal description of the property proposed to
contain the well and of the property to be served by the well. The site plan
must show the proposed location of the well and well equipment or piping
associated with the well water distribution system. The site plan must also
show all underground utilities (such as, water, sewer service, gas, electric,
telephone, cable television and the like). The applicant shall verify utility
locations when preparing the site plan by contacting the “one call utility
locate system” and shall preserve such evidence on site until the well is
drilled;
      (4)   Name of person who will drill the well; and
      (5)   Proof that the applicant either has obtained a ground water
appropriation certificate from the state or that a certificate is not required.
   (C)   Before the well is put into operation, a city official will inspect it
to determine that the well will be utilized only for permitted purposes and
that no unauthorized connections or cross-connections from the well to the
city’s water distribution system have occurred. Cross-connections may be
authorized by the Public Works Director if the city’s water distribution system
is protected from backflow from the well according to the applicable plumbing
or water quality codes designed to protect public health. The city official
will also inspect the drilling premises to determine compliance with division
(E) below. The city official shall make the investigation necessary to
determine that the well being applied for is within the property boundaries
described in the application and will not adversely affect city owned utilities
(such as, water and sewer mains, storm drains and similar structures) that may
cross through the applicant’s property, with or without an easement, as
determined by the utility locate verification required in division (B)(3)
above.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the permit
required hereunder shall be obtained by the person applying for the same or by
the drilling firm responsible for drilling the well. The permit is valid for a
period of 180 days from the date of issuance, and if drilling of a new well or
development of an existing well is not commenced within that time period, the
permit lapses.
   (E)   During the drilling process, any products of the operation shall be
confined to the premises upon which the well is being drilled. Discharging of
waste materials in or on city rights-of-way, alleys, streets or drainageways is
prohibited. In the event waste materials are improperly discharged, the
property owner or driller will be required to complete restoration and cleanup
to city specifications prior to final approval of well operation.
   (F)   The city may grant a permit for the use of a well for one of the
purposes announced in this section, but only after making the following
findings:
      (1)   For manufacturing purposes:
         (a)   The existence of a bona fide manufacturing or commercial need
for the use of well water in the manufacture of a product. For purposes of this
section, the mere fact that well water may be less expensive to use in the
manufacturing process may not be considered a bona fide manufacturing or
commercial purpose;
         (b)   That city water is used to separately supply other water demands
on the premises;
         (c)   The well is not directly or indirectly connected or cross-
connected to the city’s water distribution system; and
         (d)   The applicant has agreed to pay a reasonable fee to the city
that will compensate the city for providing standby potable water and sewage
services to the manufacturing premises. The fee will be based upon existing
rates and charges for utility services then in effect and adopted by the city.
      (2)   For uses not requiring potable water:
         (a)   The well, its piping, and fixtures will not be directly or
indirectly connected or cross-connected to the city’s water distribution system
unless the city’s water distribution system is protected from backflow from the
well by means approved by the Public Works Director as provided in division (C)
above; and
         (b)   The well will be used exclusively for the purpose stated in the
application.
      (3)   The application is not a subterfuge for using the well in question
for potable human consumption or domestic or commercial uses not allowed by
this chapter.
   (G)   Wells producing water that is discharged into the city’s wastewater
system must have a city approved water meter to measure water produced by the
well.

51.99
§ 51.05 REVOCATION.
   Any permit granted under the terms of this chapter may be revoked by the
Public Works Director if it affirmatively appears that the person operating or
using said well is doing so in violation of this chapter. Revocations by the
Public Works Director under this section may be appealed to the City
Administrator. Appeals must be made in writing to the City Administrator within
30 days after mailing the written notice of revocation.
(Ord. 2008-04, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 51.06 PROPERTY AUTHORIZED FOR WELL USE BY PERMIT.
   A well permitted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and prior city
ordinances may be used by an applicant applying for a permit pursuant to this
chapter and its use is limited to the property listed on the application.
(Ord. 2008-04, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 51.07 CONTROL VALVES.
   For any authorized well drilled, dug or excavated pursuant to a permit
granted hereunder, the city may require that the well be equipped with adequate
shutoff valves or control valves for the purpose of controlling the flow of
water from the well and for the protection of the city’s water system from
pollution from a cross-connection between well piping and the city’s water
system. Protection shall consist of installation of a backflow prevention

considered a part of the contract with each person, company or corporation
supplied water service by the city. Any person, company or corporation using
the service shall be considered to have given his, her or their express consent
to be bound by these rules and regulations. When in violation, water service
may, upon due notice, be disconnected from the building or other place of such
violation, and shall not again be turned on, except by the order of the Mayor/
City Administrator and upon payment of the sum of past due amounts, and a shut-
off and turn-on charge.
      (1)   The owner or owners of property requiring a connection to the water
mains of the city shall pay a water main connection fee. In addition to the
connection fee, the property owner will pay for all parts/supplies including
the curb stop, water meter, and labor costs incurred to complete the
connection. The hook-up fee for a new connection and for disconnection and
reconnection shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
      (2)   All service lines from the main water line to the premises of
consumers must be at least six feet deep, and upon the installation of a
service line, the depth must be measured and approved by the Public Works
Director or some person appointed by him or her, before the service line is
connected to the water main and water is furnished by the city.
      (3)   The service lines from the water mains to the user’s premises must
be of suitable tubing consistent with the standards of the American Waterworks
Society.
      (4)   In the event disputes or complaints are tendered on the part of
consumers, such disputes or complaints must be presented to the Mayor/City
Administrator in writing. In the event disputes or complaints are not resolved,
the consumer must present his, her or their dispute or complaint to the City
Council for its consideration and the Council will render the decision on the
matters presented.
      (5)   Curb boxes when installed must be installed one foot outside of the
property line on residential hook-ups and one foot in from the outside edge of
the curb on business hook-ups.
      (6)   There shall be a water meter installed upon the service pipe at the
service location of each water consumer in an approved outside meter pit or
vault. This meter is to be selected by the Public Works Director and installed
under the direction of the employees of the Water Department, who shall select
the place on the property where the meter will be installed.
   (C)   The meter pit or vault for the meter to be located in will be
installed at a location to be determined by the employees of the Water/Sewer
Department. The meter must be protected from freezing and other damage. The
cost of initial installation will be borne by the city at no cost to the
property owner for those water consumers on the existing system as of September
13, 2015 (completion of the water meter project). After the initial
installation, all new connections and/or changes to water service lines
requiring a new meter, meter pit or vault; the costs will be borne by the
property owner. Such costs will be included in the hookup fees charged by the
city for new users and changes. The city shall not be liable in any manner
should any alteration of the premises required to repair, access or change a
water meter.
   (D)   Meters for those buildings existing on Main Street will not be
required to install a meter pit or vault; those meters are to be installed on
the main service line at a location inside the building. If, for any reason,
the Public Works Director deems an outside meter pit or vault would not be
feasible at a certain location, the city will be allowed to install a meter on
the main service line of that property inside the building.
   (E)   If any water consumer interferes with the installation of a meter or
refuses to allow the installation of a meter at a place on the premises
selected by the Water Department, the water shall be turned off and shall not
be turned on again until a water meter is installed as required and a fee as
established by the City Council is paid for turning on the water. In addition,
the party interfering with the installation of the meter or refusing to allow
the installation of a meter may be guilty of a misdemeanor for each day the
meter is not installed and fined according to §
55.99.
   (F)   Water consumers are not permitted to interfere in any way with the
meter pit and/or water meter after they are set in place. In case a meter seal
is broken or the working parts of the meter have been tampered with or the
meter or pit damaged, the city may render a bill for water charges together
with the full cost of repairs or replacement of the damaged meter or meter pit.
In addition, a person found tampering with the water meters or his or her
installation may be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and fined according to the
penalties in §
55.99.
   (G)   All water meters, meter pits or vaults installed in the city must be
of a type and brand approved by the Public Works Director or his or her
designee. All meters shall be capable of being radio read and shall be
compatible with the city’s meter reading system.
   (H)   The water shall not be turned on to any house or service pipe except
by permission of the Public Works Director, and then not until the applicant
has fully complied with every requirement in this chapter. Plumbers are
strictly forbidden from turning water into any service pipe, except by order or
permission in writing from the Public Works Director. This rule shall not be
construed to prohibit plumbers from turning water into pipes for the purpose of
testing them, and for that purpose only.
   (I)   All property owners using the city’s water service shall keep their
own service pipes in good repair and protected from freezing at their own risk
and expense. It is the policy of the city that no claims or demands against the
city shall be accepted by the city by reason of broken or plugged service lines
on the water user’s property. All costs of repair and/or equipment for existing
waterlines from the mainline to the residence or served structure shall be
borne by the person receiving the water service.
   (J)   Should the property owner desire to discontinue water service, whether
temporary or permanent discontinuance, the city must be notified by the
property owner in writing at the time service is to be discontinued.
   (K)   Any person tapping the mains or opening or closing any valves,
corporation cocks or curb cocks, or opening or closing any fire hydrant,
without authority from the city to do so shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   (L)   The city reserves the right at any time, without notice, to shut off
the water in the mains for the purpose of dealing with emergency situations or
making repairs or extensions or for any other purpose. The city shall have
access at all reasonable times to all parts of any buildings or premises for
the purpose of inspecting the size and condition of the pipes and fixtures and
the manner in which the water is used.
   (M)   The city has jurisdiction over the city water system, including the
wells, pipe lines, storage tanks, conduits, rights-of-way, curb boxes, meters
and any other appurtenances. Any person found guilty of trespassing thereon
with the intent to deface or defraud, or any tampering or interfering with any
of the appliances, fixtures, meters, valves or property, with malicious or
fraudulent intent, or any person found guilty of interfering with the water
supply shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to §
55.99.
   (N)   Property owners sharing a common building or structure shall provide,
at their own expense, separate shut off valves as approved by the Director of
Public Works for the delivery of water services from the city and shall allow
sole control over any and all of the valves in the event of non-payment by any

authority granted by the state statutes to remove abandoned, wrecked,

Council hereby makes the following findings and declarations:
   (A)   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not

value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite
plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for
rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general
welfare; and
   (B)   Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not
including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is hereby
declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

private nuisance as defined under provisions of law.
(Ord. 119, passed 4-21-1980)
§ 93.04 EXCLUSIVE REGULATION.

chapter, such officer and his or her deputies may enter upon private or public
property to examine a vehicle or parts thereof, or obtain information as to the

notice to the property owner that he or she may appear in person at a hearing
or may present a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the

within ten days after the mailing of notice of intention to abate and remove
the vehicle. If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a
sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle

request for hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting
such request. If such a request is not received in such period, the Chief of
Police shall have the authority to remove the vehicle.

§ 93.10 HEARING BEFORE CHIEF OF POLICE.
   (A)   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the Chief of
Police who shall hear all facts and testimony he or she deems pertinent. Said
facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or
part thereof and the circumstances concerning its location on the said private
property of public property. The Chief of Police shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land on which the vehicle is
located may appear in person at the hearing or present a written sworn
statement, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land,
with his or her reasons for such denial.
   (B)   The Chief of Police may impose such conditions and take such other
action as he or she deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
purpose of this chapter. He or she may delay the time for removal of the
vehicle or part thereof if, in his or her opinion, the circumstances justify
it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Chief of Police may find that
a vehicle or part thereof has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or is
inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the
property as a public nuisance and disposed of as hereinafter provided and
determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged
against the owner of the parcel of land on which the vehicle or part thereof is
located. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle
or part thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the
vehicle, if available at the site.
   (C)   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
land without the consent of the landowner and that he or she has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the Chief of Police shall not assess
costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon
which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from
such landowner.
   (D)   If an interested party makes a written presentation to the Chief of
Police but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing of the
decision.
   (E)   Any interested person may appeal the decision of the Chief of Police
by filing a written notice of appeal with the Chief of Police within five days
after his or her decision.
   (F)   Such appeal shall be heard by the Council which may affirm, amend or
reverse the order or take any other action deemed appropriate.
   (G)   The Clerk shall give at least five days’ prior written notice of the
time and place of the hearing to the appellant and those persons set forth in §
93.08.

§ 93.11 REMOVAL.
   (A)   Five days after adoption of the order declaring the vehicle or parts

of the decision if such notice is required by §
93.10, the vehicles or parts thereof may be disposed of by removal to a scrap
yard or automobile dismantler’s year.
   (B)   After a vehicle has been removed it shall not thereafter be
reconstructed or made operable.
(Ord. 119, passed 4-21-1980)
§ 93.12 NOTICE.
   Within five days after the date of removal of the vehicle or part thereof,
notice shall be given to the Department of Motor Vehicles identifying the
vehicle or part thereof removed. At the same time there shall be transmitted to
the Department of Motor Vehicles any evidence of registration available,
including registration certificates, certificates of title and license plates.
If the Council determines that commercial channels are not suitable or are
inadequate, it may dispose of the vehicles by removal to any suitable site
operated by it. The city may make final disposition of such vehicles or parts
thereof or may transfer the same to another provided such disposal is only for
scrap.
(Ord. 119, passed 4-21-1980)
§ 93.13 REMOVAL COSTS.
   If the administrative costs and the cost of removal which are charged
against the owner of a parcel of land pursuant to §
93.10 are not paid within 30 days of the date of the order, or the final
disposition of an appeal therefrom, such costs shall be assessed against the
parcel of land, and shall be transmitted to the Tax Collector for collection.
Said assessment shall have the same priority as other city taxes.
(Ord. 119, passed 4-21-1980)
§ 93.14 FAILURE TO REMOVE.

illustrative, it being the intent and purpose of this subsection to include as
nuisances, all actions or things of the character described in subsection (J)
(l), above.
         (a)   Accumulating, maintaining or storing in public view on any lot
or other parcel of land, any abandoned, discarded, or unused furniture, stoves,
sinks, toilets, cabinets, household fixtures or equipment, or junk. If such

cardboard boxes, broken packing boxes, paper, or other similar items on any lot

reptiles, vermin or wild animals or may furnish a breeding place for mosquitoes
or flies;
         (f)   Maintaining, or causing or permitting the same on any lot or
other parcel of land, any building, premises, or fence which is determined to
be dangerous or dilapidated. (See Boulder Municipal Code Title 7). Any building
or structure which has any or all of the conditions or defects hereinafter

restoration is completed and shall make final restoration with hot asphalt mix
when it is available.
(Ord. 2009-03, passed 8-31-2009)
§ 151.13 WARRANTY PERIOD.
   (A)   Any person making a street or alley opening that requires subsequent
restoration of the surface, curb and gutter, or sidewalk, shall warrant the
quality and durability of the restoration for one year after acceptance by the
Public Works Department of the completed restoration to all portions of the
right-of-way disturbed by the opening, including the road surface, curb and
gutter, and sidewalk, and the proper disposal of all waste material.
   (B)   Upon failure of a right-of-way restoration during the warranty period,
the Public Works Director will notify the person who provided the warranty of
the failure. A restoration failure has occurred when any part of the restored
surface has fallen or heaved by more than one-half inch above or below the
adjacent surface, or the restored surface has internal or external cracking or
deterioration to the extent the structural integrity of the restoration is
compromised. Immediately upon receiving notice, the person who provided the
warranty shall secure the failed site and provide adequate barricading and
warning signs to protect the public. That person shall then commence repair to
the failed site by the next working day. If the repair is not timely made, the
Public Works Department may make the necessary repairs and the person failing
to do the repair shall reimburse the city for all material and direct and
indirect labor costs expended in making the repair. If the person fails to
reimburse the city for the material and labor costs within 30 days of the date
of the notice requesting payment, that person may be barred from receiving
future street and alley opening permits.

§ 152.01 TITLE, PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Floodplain hazard management regulations. These regulations are known
and may be cited as the “Floodplain Hazard Management Regulations,” hereinafter
referred to as “these regulations.”
   (B)   Statutory authority.
      (1)   Floodplain and floodway management is incorporated in M.C.A. Title
76, Chapter 5 and describes the authority, procedures and minimum standards for
local regulations and is further described in Montana Administrative Rule (ARM)
36, Chapter 15.
      (2)   The authority to regulate development in specifically identified
flood hazard areas has been accepted pursuant to M.C.A. § 76-5-301.
   (C)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   Flood hazard areas specifically adopted herein as regulated flood
hazard areas have been delineated and designated by order or determination of
the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) pursuant to M.C.A.
§§ 76-5-201 et seq.
      (2)   These regulations have been reviewed by State Department of Natural
Resources and Conservation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The
State Department of Natural Resources and Conservation has found the
regulations acceptable in meeting the Department minimum standards. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency finds that these regulations are adequate and
consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use pursuant
to the standards established in 44 C.F.R. § 60.3.
(M.C.A. § 76-5-302, ARM 36.15.202, 44 C.F.R. § 60.1(b), 42 U.S.C. § 4022)
   (D)   Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to promote public health,
safety and general welfare of the residents and minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in regulated flood hazard areas. These
regulations are intended to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business and public service interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
disruptions; and
      (7)   Ensure compliance with the minimum standards for the continued
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program for the benefit of the
residents.
   (E)   Methods to reduce losses. In accordance with M.C.A. § 76-5-102, these
regulations are intended to reduce flood losses through the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or that may cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses of land vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities, be developed or constructed to at least minimum standards or to
otherwise minimize flood damage;
      (3)   Regulate the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are needed to accommodate floodwaters;
      (4)   Regulate filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
impact other land, flood water depth or velocity of floodwaters;
      (6)   Distinguish between the land use regulations applied to the
floodway within the regulated flood hazard area and those applied to that
portion of the regulated flood hazard area not contained in the floodway;
      (7)   Apply more restrictive land use regulations within the floodway of
the regulated flood hazard area; and
      (8)   Ensure that regulations and minimum standards balance the greatest
public good with the least private injury.
   (F)   Regulated area.
      (1)   These regulations apply only to the flood hazard areas specifically
adopted herein as regulated flood hazard areas which are more fully and
specifically described in §
153.04. Requirements and approvals for alterations to the regulated flood
hazard area are specified in §
153.04. The regulated flood hazard area includes areas specifically identified,
labeled and illustrated on maps such as floodplain, floodway or flood fringe
that have differing uses allowed and minimum building standards that apply. The
regulated flood hazard area is the geographic area inundated by the flood of
100-year frequency illustrated and depicted in the referenced studies and maps.
      (2)   The regulated flood hazard area supporting study and maps
illustrating the regulatory area are based on studies and maps that have been
specifically adopted pursuant to M.C.A. §§ 76-5-201 et seq. The maps and
accompanying study become the regulated flood hazard area only when formally
adopted by DNRC and subsequently by the political subdivision by these
regulations. The original source of studies and data may be from a flood
insurance study by FEMA, or other studies by Corps of Engineers, Soil
Conservation, United States Geological Service or other federal or state
agency.
   (G)   Floodplain Administrator. A Floodplain Administrator is hereby
officially appointed and is the responsibility of the Mayor and City Council.
The Floodplain Administrator’s duty is to administer and implement the
provisions of these regulations. The Floodplain Administrator must serve to
meet and maintain the commitments pursuant to 44 C.F.R. § 59.22(a) to FEMA to

deed restrictions, zoning or other regulations in effect. However, where these
regulations impose greater restrictions, the provision of these regulations
must prevail.
(44 C.F.R. § 60.1(d))
   (J)   Regulation interpretation. In the interpretation and application of
these regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(44 C.F.R. § 60.1)
   (K)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. These regulations do not imply
that land outside the regulated flood hazard areas or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall
not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on these regulations or
any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (L)   Disclosure provision. All property owners or their agents in the
regulated flood hazard areas shall notify potential buyers or their agents that
such property, including any permitted uses transferred, is located within the
regulated flood hazard area and is subject to regulation and any permitted uses
that are transferred. Information regarding regulated flood hazard area and the
repository for floodplain maps is available in the Floodplain Administrator’s
office.
(ARM 36.15.204(2)(g))

before development occurs that is within the regulated flood hazard area.
(44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b))
   (P)   Disaster recovery.
      (1)   In the event of a natural or human-made disaster, the Floodplain
Administrator should participate in the coordination of assistance and provide
information to structure owners concerning hazard mitigation and recovery
measures with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, State Disaster Emergency
Services, State Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and other
state, local and private emergency service organizations.
      (2)   Upon completion of cursory street view structure condition survey
within the regulated flood hazard area, the Floodplain Administrator shall
notify owners that a permit may be necessary for an alteration or substantial
improvement before repair or reconstruction commences on damaged structures
because of damages caused by natural or human-made disasters such as floods,
fires or winds.
      (3)   Owners should be advised that structures that have suffered
substantial damage and will undergo substantial improvements require a
floodplain application and permit and must be upgraded to meet the minimum
building standards herein during repair or reconstruction.

(Ord. 2018-01, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 152.04 REGULATED FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   Regulated flood hazard areas. The regulated flood hazard areas are the
100-year floodplains illustrated and referenced in the following specific
studies and reports described as follows:
      (1)   April 15, 1986 FEMA flood insurance rate map for the city.
(Attached to the ordinance codified herein as Appendix A.);
      (2)   The regulated flood hazard areas specifically described or
illustrated in the above referenced studies and maps of the 100-year floodplain
have been delineated, designated and established by order or determination by
the DNRC pursuant to M.C.A. §§ 76-5-201 et seq.; and
      (3)   Use allowances, design and construction requirements specifically
in §§
152.05,
152.06,
152.09 and
152.10 in these regulations vary by the specific floodplain areas including
areas identified as floodway and flood fringe within the regulated flood hazard
area.
   (B)   Interpretation of regulated flood hazard area boundaries.
      (1)   The mapped boundaries of the floodplain illustrated in the
referenced studies and maps in this section are a guide for determining whether
property is within the regulated flood hazard area.
      (2)   A determination of the outer limits and boundaries of the regulated
flood hazard area or the flood fringe and floodway within the regulated flood
hazard area includes an evaluation of the maps as well as the particular study
data referenced in this section. Supporting study material for base flood
elevations takes precedence over any map illustrations if it exists.
      (3)   The regulated flood hazard area boundary is delineated by the base
flood elevation. The physical field regulatory boundary of the regulated flood
hazard area is the actual intersection of the applicable study base flood
elevation with the existing adjacent terrain of the watercourse or drainway.
(ARM 36.15.501(6))
      (4)   The floodway boundary where identified within the floodplain is as
illustrated on the referenced maps and studies. Since the floodway boundary is
a study feature, the location of the boundary may be physically located by
referencing the study data to a ground feature. The Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of the boundary and decision may be appealed as set forth in §
152.13.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator may request additional information
described below to determine whether or not the proposed development is within
the regulated flood hazard area.
         (a)   Where base flood elevations exist, the property owner may
provide additional information which may include elevation information provided
by an engineer or land surveyor in order to determine if the proposed
development is subject to these regulations. (ARM 36.15.501(6))
         (b)   Where base flood elevations do not exist, the property owner may
provide additional information to be considered to determine the location of
the regulatory boundary or alternatively provide a computed base flood
elevation provided by an engineer.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of the boundaries
and decision may be appealed as set forth in §
153.13.
      (6)   Any owner or lessee of property who believes his or her property
has been inadvertently included in the regulated flood hazard area including
the floodway or flood fringe may submit scientific and/or technical information
to the Floodplain Administrator for a determination if the property is
appropriately located. Scientific or technical information submitted to FEMA by
an owner to affect the insurance rating for insurance purposes may be
considered by the Floodplain Administrator. A determination by the Floodplain
Administrator is independent of any determination by FEMA for insurance
purposes.
   (C)   Alteration of regulated flood hazard area.
      (1)   Revisions or updates to the specific maps and data that alter the
established floodplains or floodway of the regulated flood hazard area requires
DNRC approval pursuant to M.C.A. § 75-5-203. An alteration of the regulated
flood hazard area is a DNRC approved amendment to the DNRC order that
originally delineated and designated the 100-year floodplain and is the basis
of the regulated flood hazard area referenced in division (A)(2) above. A DNRC
approved alteration consists of revisions or updates to the specific maps and
data of the referenced studies in this section and forms the basis for an
amendment to the regulated flood hazard area in these regulations;
(ARM 36.15.505)
      (2)   Any change to the regulated flood hazard area as a result of a DNRC
alteration is effective upon amendment to the regulated flood hazard area
described in division (A)(1) above;
      (3)   Substantial natural physical change or new technical or scientific
flood data showing that the base flood elevation has or may be changed or was
erroneously established shall be brought to the attention of DNRC and FEMA;
(ARM 36.15.505(1)(a)) (44 C.F.R. § 65.3)
      (4)   Any floodplain permit application for a proposed development or
artificial obstruction must be denied until a DNRC alteration pursuant to
M.C.A. § 76-5-203 is approved if it causes an increase of 0.5 feet or more to
the base flood elevation of a regulated flood hazard area without a floodway or
an increase of more than 0.00 feet to the base flood elevation of a floodway;
      (5)   To propose an alteration a petition must be submitted to DNRC and
must include the following information:
         (a)   Certification that no buildings are located in the areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
(44 C.F.R. § 65.12(a)(5))
         (b)   Evidence of notice to all property and land owners of the
proposed impacts to their properties explaining the proposed impact on their
property;
(44 C.F.R. § 65.12(a)(3))
         (c)   Information that demonstrates that alternatives are not
feasible;
(44 C.F.R. § 65.12(2))
         (d)   Information that demonstrates that development is for a public
use or benefit; and
         (e)   Any other supporting information and data as needed for
approvals.
(ARM 36.15.505) (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(c)(10)) (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(d)(3)) (44 C.F.R. §
65.7(3)) (44 C.F.R. § 65.12))
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator may represent the permit authority for
any necessary applications, approvals or endorsements such as the FEMA
community acknowledgment form to FEMA where affecting the FEMA special flood
hazard area;
      (7)   A determination by the Floodplain Administrator that land areas
located within the regulated flood hazard area are above the base flood
elevation as proven by a certified elevation survey does not constitute or
require an alteration or an amendment of the regulated flood hazard area and
may be maintained as a public record that more explicitly defines the regulated
flood hazard area boundary;
      (8)   Elevating with suitable fill as permitted does not alter the
regulated flood hazard area or remove the elevated area from the regulated
flood hazard area; and
(ARM 36.15.505(2))
      (9)   A floodplain permit implementing the physical change cannot be
approved until a CLOMR has been issued by FEMA.
(Ord. 2018-01, passed 5-21-2008)

seq.), the Zoning Commission and Planning Board shall hold joint and concurrent
review, including a joint public hearing(s). Notice of each hearing shall be

structures subject to this chapter.
(Ord. 2007-03, passed 1-14-2008)
§ 153.31 NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Within the districts established by this chapter, lots, structures
and uses of land and structures may exist which were lawful at the time this
chapter was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited or regulated
under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. The intent of this section
is to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not
to encourage their survival. This chapter further intends that nonconformities
shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
      (2)   Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the same district. However, to avoid undue hardship,
nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter and which actual building construction has been carried on diligently.
Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where
excavation, demolition or removal of an existing building has substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shad
be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on
diligently.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record.
      (1)   In any district, notwithstanding other limitations imposed by this
chapter, structures permitted in a district may be established on any single
lot of record on the effective date of this chapter. The lot must be in
separate ownership and not of contiguous frontage with other lots of the same
ownership. A lot of record that does not meet lot area or lot width
requirements must meet all other requirements of the district.
      (2)   If two or more nonconforming lots with contiguous frontage in
single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this
chapter, and if any of the lots do not meet the requirements established for
lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of this parcel shall be
used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance; nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area that fails to meet
the requirements stated in this chapter.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land and structures. Where, at the time of
passage of this chapter, a lawful use of land or a structure exists which would
not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, the use may be
continued where it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
      (1)   A nonconforming use may not be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land or structure than was occupied on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
      (2)   No nonconforming use may be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
      (3)   Should any nonconforming use cease for any reason for a period of
more than one year, any subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such
land is located; and
      (4)   No additional nonconforming structure shall be erected in
connection with such nonconforming use of land or structures.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter but becomes
nonconforming under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on
area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may be continued, provided it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   A nonconforming structure may not be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should a nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its
replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed
except in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
      (4)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the routine
repair and maintenance of a nonconforming structure.
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any officials charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.

§ 153.56 HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. 
      (1)   The purpose and intent of this district is to stimulate the
restoration and rehabilitation of structures and property that contribute to
the character and fabric of established residential, commercial or industrial
neighborhoods. New construction will be encouraged provided the primary
emphasis is on preservation of existing buildings and that the design of new
development furthers the aesthetic character and function of the property and
area.
      (2)   Because most of the development within the district occurred prior
to adoption of zoning and other regulations, the land use and design is highly
diverse and often does not conform to conventional regulations. This section
recognizes that this diversity is a major contributing factor of the district’s
historic character. This section may be applied to encourage the protection and
enhancement of the existing historic and diverse features.
   (B)   Historic Preservation Overlay District established.
      (1)   After thorough study and inventory, the City Council may designate
a geographical area within the municipality having significant historical value
and character as a Historic Preservation Overlay District (HPOD).
      (2)   The boundaries of the HPOD may overlap (in other words, overlay)
the boundaries of other districts established under this chapter.
      (3)   A proposed development must conform to the requirements of both
this overlay district and the underlying district, except that through the
procedures of this overlay district a portion of the requirements of the
underlying district may be waived or modified.
      (4)   All new development within this district shall be reviewed and
acted upon by the Zoning Commission under the procedures of §
153.11.
   (C)   Design Review Board: powers.
      (1)   The City Council shall form and appoint a Design Review Board.
      (2)   The Design Review Board will comprise seven local members as
follows:
         (a)   Two licensed professional architects;
         (b)   One building contractor;
         (c)   The Zoning Administrator;
         (d)   One member of the City Council; and
         (e)   Two citizens.
      (3)   The Design Review Board shall have the following powers and
responsibilities:
         (a)   Review applications for development within this Historic
Preservation Overlay District.
         (b)   Recommend to the Zoning Commission appropriate modifications of
requirements of the underlying zoning district, and recommendations for
approval, conditions for conditional approval or denial of an application for
development within the HPOD;
         (c)   Develop and apply specific guidelines related to architectural
appearance, landscape design and signing for the construction or alteration of
structures or sites within the HPOD;
         (d)   Call upon city staff for advice or assistance; and
         (e)   Testify before boards or the City Council on matters relating to
architecturally significant sites, structures, areas or neighborhoods.
   (D)   Procedures for review and action.
      (1)   A person proposing development within the HPOD must submit an
application for a conditional use to the Zoning Administrator. The application
must present the information specified in §
153.11, and sketches of proposed new construction or alterations to existing
structures.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator will forward copies of the application to
the members of the Design Review Board and the Zoning Commission.
      (3)   The Design Review Board will review the application and meet with
the applicant.
      (4)   The Design Review Board will submit recommendations to the Zoning
Commission.
      (5)   The Zoning Commission and the Design Review Board will publish
notice and hold a joint public hearing to discuss the application. At the
hearing, the Zoning Administrator and the developer will be invited to explain
the proposed project, the Design Review Board will discuss its recommendations,
and the members of the general public will be invited to comment.
      (6)   The Zoning Commission, considering the recommendations of the
Zoning Administrator, Design Review Board and public comment, will approve,
conditionally approve or deny the application under the procedures specified in
§
153.11. The Zoning Commission will present in writing the conditions for
conditional approval or the reasons for denial.
   (E)   Standards of Historic Preservation Review. The Design Review Board and
the Zoning Commission will be guided by the following in considering
appropriate design and modifying requirements of the underlying zoning
districts:
      (1)   Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings, published by the U.S. Department of Interior, National Park
Service, Preservation Assistance Division (available for review at the office
of the Zoning Administrator).
      (2)   Architectural design guidelines used to consider the

            3.   Location, surfacing and marking of off-street parking areas;
and
            4.   Other conditions in conformity with the intent and purpose of
this section.
