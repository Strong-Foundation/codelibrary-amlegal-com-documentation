§ 1.24.010 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Every act prohibited by city ordinance is unlawful. Unless another
penalty is expressly provided by this code for a particular act or offense,
every person convicted of an infraction or violation of any provision of this
code, or any rule or regulation adopted or issued pursuant to this code, is
guilty of a minor offense as that term is defined in the Alaska Rules of Minor
Offense Procedure and shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500) unless the penalty is established by fine schedule, in which
case the maximum penalty shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000).
   (B)   In addition to any other remedies or penalties which may be provided
in this code, or may otherwise be available, the city or any aggrieved person
may institute a civil action to obtain injunctive or compensatory relief
against a person who violates any provision of the code. In addition to
injunctive and compensatory relief, a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000) may be imposed for each violation. An action to enjoin a
violation may be brought notwithstanding the availability of any other remedy.
On application for injunctive relief and a finding of violation or threatened
violation, the superior court shall grant the injunction. The City shall be
entitled to collect all reasonable attorney’s fees in any successful civil
action to enforce the laws of the City.
   (C)   Each act of violation and every day upon which the violation occurs
constitutes a separate offense.
   (D)   No penalties established by a fine schedule, whether set forth in full
or adopted as part of this code by reference, may be judicially reduced.

§ 1.24.015 SURCHARGE REQUIRED.
   In addition to any penalty prescribed by law, a defendant convicted of
violating a city ordinance shall pay the surcharge required under AS 12.55.039
and 29.25.074. All such surcharges collected shall be remitted to the State of
Alaska as required by AS 29.25.074.
(Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)
§ 1.24.020 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The charge for the violation of a code provision may be brought by any
peace officer, the city manager, or that city official responsible for the
administration and enforcement of the code provision which has been violated.
   (B)   The city shall use the Alaska Uniform Citation form, or the electronic
version if authorized, to provide notice of a minor offense to anyone accused
of violating any provision of this code.
(Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)
§ 1.24.030 DISPOSITION OF MINOR OFFENSES.
   A person charged with a minor offense listed on a fine schedule may appear
in court to contest the charge. If an offense is not listed on a fine schedule,
or if the citation indicates that a court appearance is mandatory, the
defendant must appear in court to answer the charges. As a minor offense, trial
is by the court without a jury, and there is no right to court-appointed
defense counsel.
(Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)
§ 1.24.040 MINOR OFFENSE FINE SCHEDULE.
   In accordance with AS 29.25.070(a), citations for the following offenses may
be disposed of as provided in AS 12.25.195-.230, without a court appearance,
upon payment of the fine amounts listed below, plus the state surcharge
required by AS 12.55.039 and AS 29.25.074. Fines must be paid to the court. The
Alaska Court System’s Rules of Minor Offense Procedures apply to all offenses
listed below. If a person charged with one of these offenses appears in court
and is found guilty, the penalty imposed for the offense may not exceed the
fine schedule amount listed below for that offense. Citations charging these
offenses must meet the requirements of the Rules of Minor Offense Procedure.
The fines set forth below may not be judicially reduced.

the City Manager and the City Council no later than thirty (30) days after the
complaint is submitted. The opinion shall include their determination regarding
whether a violation has occurred as charged in the complaint and a statement of
the facts provided by the party whose actions are being questioned.

Council, a hearing on the matters concerning the City Council member involved
may be initiated by the introduction of a resolution of forfeiture by another
member of the City Council, by a group of City Council members, or by a
committee of the City Council.
      (5)   After the City Attorney's opinion or that of retained counsel has
been delivered to the City Manager and the City Council, the City Manager, or a
member of the City Council may, if they believe that reasonable people would
differ as to whether a violation of this Chapter has occurred, proceed to bring
the matter before the City Council for hearing by filing charges with the City
Clerk. Any hearing shall be held no later than thirty (30) days after receipt
of the opinion. The person named in the charges shall attend any such hearing
and may be represented by counsel. Failure of the person named to attend the
hearing in person shall be deemed an admission of the charges filed with the
City Clerk.

conflict, prosecute the charge, after direction to do so by the City Council,

3.16.040   Development and administration
   
3.16.050   Status of incumbents in reclassified positions
§ 3.16.010 CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The classification plan is the grouping of positions into appropriate
classes which are sufficiently similar with respect to duties and
responsibilities. Each class in the classification plan shall be designated by
a descriptive title and defined by a class specification. The classification
plan shall be established by resolution of the City Council and shall be
periodically updated. The city may by ordinance designate positions that are
wholly or partially exempt from the classified service. Such positions are
filled by persons who serve at the discretion of the appointing authority and
whose terms of employment are determined by the appointing authority.
§ 3.16.020 CLASS SPECIFICATION.
   A class specification is a written description of each class position
included in the classification plan. Specifications shall include a class
title, a general statement of essential and non-essential duties and
responsibilities, typical examples of duties performed, and minimum
qualifications for entrance into a class. Special requirements, where
appropriate, such as required licenses or certifications, shall also be
included. A class specification shall be considered only as a descriptive
guideline and not as inclusive of all duties to be found in a position
allocated to a particular class.
§ 3.16.030 PURPOSE OF CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The classification plan is an administrative tool that provides a system of
standardized titles and common job language and is important to the effective
administration of personnel activities such as the following:
   (A)   Personnel planning and budgeting;
   (B)   Establishing job performance standards;
   (C)   Establishing fair and equitable pay;
   (D)   Developing valid selection and recruitment programs; and
   (E)   Establishing appropriate career lines.
§ 3.16.040 DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   The City Manager or designee shall analyze and evaluate the duties,
responsibilities and qualifications required for each position in the
classification plan and then assign each position to the appropriate class. Any
employee who believes the position classification to be incorrect may request a
review by the City Manager.
   (B)   The City Manager shall periodically (but no less often than every
three years) review the classification plan and shall make a report to the City
Council. The purpose of such review and report shall be:
      (1)   To ascertain whether or not the classification plan accurately
reflects existing conditions;
      (2)   To determine the accuracy of class specifications; and
      (3)   To assure that positions are properly classified.
The City Manager shall recommend to the City Council changes needed in the
classification plan to keep it current.
   (C)   When a new position is proposed or established, the Department
Director shall provide a written position description to the City Manager or
designee who shall determine the proper classification or prepare a new
classification description if an appropriate classification does not exist.
   (D)   Whenever the duties of a position change, the City Manager, or the
Manager’s designee, shall review the matter and, if necessary, reclassify the
position to the appropriate class. In considering whether to reclassify any
position, the City Manager shall be provided a written request for
reclassification by the Director of the Department in which the position is
located. The City Manager shall issue a written procedure governing
reclassification requests and the information that must be provided to the City
Manager by the Department Director. The City Manager shall notify the City
Council of any pending reclassification request before acting on the request.
In making a decision on any reclassification request, the City Manager shall
consider the potential impacts of reclassification on all Departments of the
city. Any reclassification shall not be effective until the first date of the
pay period following the effective date of either a budget amendment or a
budget ordinance appropriating funds for the reclassified position.
Reclassification shall not be used to avoid the provisions of the personnel
policy dealing with layoffs, demotions, promotions or dismissals.
(Am. Ord. 99-01, passed 3-9-99; Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.16.050 STATUS OF INCUMBENTS IN RECLASSIFIED POSITIONS.
   In all cases of reclassification, the employee who held the position before
it was reclassified shall be entitled to remain in the position if the employee
meets the minimum qualifications for the reclassified position. If the
incumbent does not meet the minimum qualifications for the reclassified
position the city may provide a reasonable opportunity for the incumbent to
qualify for the reclassified position. If the incumbent fails to meet the
qualifications for the reclassified position and is not transferred, promoted
or demoted, the provisions of the personnel policy regarding separation shall
apply.

officers, and reviewing officers to see that performance evaluation procedures
are conducted in accordance with the provisions stated in this chapter.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.24.020 PURPOSE OF EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROGRAM.
   The primary purpose of the employee performance evaluation program is to
inform employees how well they are performing and to offer constructive
criticism on how they can improve their work performance. Performance
evaluation shall also be considered in decisions affecting salary advancement,
promotions, demotions, dismissals, order of layoff, order of reemployment,
placement and training needs.
(Am. Ord. 99-01, passed 3-9-99; Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.24.030 PERIODS OF EVALUATION.
   All performance evaluations shall be in writing, with one copy given to the
employee and one copy to be placed in the employee’s personnel file. Each
employee’s performance shall be evaluated at the following periods:
   (A)   Probationary period. Each employee appointed to a regular full-time,
regular part-time, or regular less than part-time position shall be evaluated
prior to or near the conclusion of their at-will probationary term. An
evaluation shall be completed and documented by the employee’s direct
supervisor or designee and submitted to the personnel officer. The employee
must have at least an overall satisfactory evaluation in order to become a
regular employee. Failure to have at least an overall satisfactory evaluation
can result in an extension of the probationary period or termination.
   (B)   Annual. Each employee in a regular full-time, regular part-time, or
regular less than part-time position shall receive an annual performance
evaluation, generally between April and May. The employee’s performance must be
rated at least satisfactory in order to be eligible for a merit increase. The
granting of an annual wage increase is a merit increase based on performance
and not an automatic longevity increase.
   (C)   Special. A special performance evaluation may be completed whenever
there is a significant change either upward or downward in the employee’s
performance or to initiate a 360
Performance Review as a supplemental tool to obtain performance feedback.
   (D)   Exception. If an employee’s initial evaluation has been conducted
after November 1 and before April 1, the next evaluation will be completed in
October unless an earlier evaluation is requested by either the supervisor or
employee.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.24.040 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS.
   (A)   Annual performance. The annual performance evaluation is a key
component of employee development and is intended to be a fair and balanced
assessment of an employee’s performance. The object of the annual review is to
provide all regular employees and their supervisors an opportunity to:
      (1)   Discuss job performance and identify areas of potential
improvement;
      (2)   Set goals for professional development;
      (3)   Establish objectives for contributing to the department and city’s
overall mission;
      (4)   Discuss expectations and accomplishments; and
      (5)   Review job descriptions to ensure accuracies in tasks being
expected.
   (B)   City Manager responsibility. The City Manager or designee is
responsible for issuance of forms and procedures concerning all aspects of
performance evaluations.
   (C)   Supervisor responsibility. Annual evaluations must be done by an
employee’s immediate supervisor. If circumstances are such that it is not
feasible for the employee’s supervisor to be the rating officer, the Director
may designate a different supervisor. The rating officer shall be responsible
for completing a performance evaluation report at the time prescribed for each
employee under their supervision. The supervisor’s role is to help the employee
grow professionally by identifying performance improvement opportunities.
   (D)   Director or designee responsibility. The Director or assigned designee
shall review the performance evaluation report completed by each supervisor in
the department before the report is discussed with the employee. It is the
responsibility of the Director to ensure the Supervisor has fairly and
accurately completed the employee’s performance in its entirety and suggest any
changes necessary. If the performance evaluation report has been initially
completed by a Department Director, the reviewing officer shall be the City
Manager or designee.
   (E)   Human Resources Manager responsibility. The Human Resources Manager is
responsible for reviewing the performance evaluation as completed by the
supervisor and director after the report has been discussed with the employee.
The Human Resources Manager may provide assistance in the development or review
of a draft performance evaluation. The Human Resources Manager has the
authority to suggest changes to the supervisor and director if deficiencies in
the evaluation are identified and to suggest improvements to the supervisor and
director for future performance reviews.
   (F)   360 performance reviews. 360 performance reviews are intended to allow
for an opportunity for comments about management’s performance from a variety
of sources to aid in the review of supervisors, directors, and managers.
      (1)   Those asked to complete a 360 performance review will not be
identified to the individual being evaluated and will have direct knowledge and
interact routinely with the person being reviewed.
      (2)   All information included in the review shall be true and include
concrete data that focuses on attitude, teamwork, ability and communication.
      (3)   The information provided to the employee being reviewed will be a
summary without names or dates and is provided to help the individual
understand their strengths and weaknesses and contribute insights into aspects
of their work. 360 performance reviews shall not be the basis for any
disciplinary action or determination of eligibility for a merit increase but
can be the basis for initiation of an administrative investigation. A 360
performance review will be included in the employee’s personnel records.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.24.050 REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE REPORT.
   The personnel completing the performance evaluation shall discuss the
performance evaluation report with the employee before the report is made part
of the employee’s permanent record.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.24.060 UNSATISFACTORY EVALUATION.
   Employees who receive an overall rating of unsatisfactory on their annual
evaluation shall not be eligible to receive a merit increase, and may be
subject to appropriate measures necessary to bring performance up to acceptable
standards, including demotion or termination based on an inability to
satisfactorily perform the necessary and essential functions of the job.
§ 3.24.070 EXCLUSION OF EVALUATIONS FROM GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   Performance evaluations and 360 performance reviews shall not be subject to
the grievance procedure set forth in
Chapter 3.36; however an employee shall be allowed to submit written comments
responding to that employee’s performance evaluation or 360 performance review.
Such comments shall be submitted within five working days from the date the
person completing the report discusses the performance evaluation report or 360
performance review with the employee. Such comments shall be included with the
performance evaluation in the employee’s personnel records.

§ 3.36.010 SCOPE.
   This chapter shall not apply to represented employees or employees who have
not successfully completed the probationary period at the time of the alleged
action or omission, or to disputes involving a performance evaluation. Section
3.36.020 shall not apply to employees who have received a pre-disciplinary
hearing.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.36.020 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   Any employee having a problem regarding employment shall first discuss the
problem with the immediate supervisor. If the problem is not settled, and it
can be defined as a grievance as set forth in §
3.04.010(S), the employee has the right to present a grievance in accordance
with the procedures and within the time limits set forth in this chapter. The
time limits set forth in this chapter may be extended in writing by mutual
agreement of the parties.
   (A)   Step I. The aggrieved employee shall discuss the grievance with their
immediate supervisor. If the grievance cannot be resolved informally through
discussion, it shall then be reduced to writing as a formal grievance, and the
written grievance shall be submitted to the Department Director. The written
grievance must be submitted within ten calendar days of the date that the
employee knows or has reason to know of the conduct or actions upon which the
grievance is based. Failure to notify the city within this time limit shall
constitute a bar to further action on the alleged grievance. The written
grievance shall describe the actions or omissions that are alleged to
constitute improper conduct by the city and shall indicate the rule or rules
that have allegedly been misapplied, misinterpreted or violated by the city.
   (B) Step II. Upon receipt of a written grievance, a Department Director
shall notify the City Manager and Human Resources Manager and within 14
calendar days, respond in writing to the employee. If the Department Director
fails to respond to the employee’s written grievance within this time limit,
the grievance shall proceed to Step IV without further action of the employee.
   (C)   Step III. Upon receipt of the Department Director’s response, the
employee shall have 14 calendar days to appeal the decision in writing to the
City Manager. If the employee fails to appeal the Department Director’s
decision within this time limit, such failure to respond shall serve to declare
the grievance as settled based upon the Department Director’s decision.
   (D)   Step IV. Within 14 calendar days of receipt of a written appeal of the
decision of the Department Director, the City Manager or designee, shall review
the matter and respond in writing to the employee’s grievance.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent settlement of a
grievance by mutual agreement of the parties at any time.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.36.030 RESERVED.
§ 3.36.040 PRE-DISCIPLINARY HEARING.
   A dismissal, demotion with reduction in pay or suspension without pay of an
employee in the classified service with regular status shall be accomplished
and reviewed only in accordance with the procedures stated in this section:
   (A)   Before a Department Director may dismiss, demote with a reduction in
pay or suspend without pay an employee, the employee shall receive written
notice of intent to discipline containing a reasonably specific statement of
the basis for the intended discipline, the proposed time for a pre-disciplinary
hearing and an explanation of the employee’s right to participate in the
hearing. If the employee is unavailable, the notice shall be given by certified
mail.
   (B)   Failure of the employee to participate in the pre-disciplinary hearing
waives the employee’s rights to a pre-disciplinary hearing. The City may take
disciplinary action based on evidence previously received.
   (C)   The City Manager or designee shall conduct the pre-disciplinary
hearing.
   (D)   Existing pay status shall not be provided beyond the date initially
set for the hearing if the employee or representative requests and is granted
an extension of the hearing date for any reason. If the city requests, and is
granted, an extension of the hearing date for any reason, the employee shall be
continued in pay status.
   (E)   The city shall issue a written notice to the employee of the decision
on whether to impose discipline no later than three working days after the
close of the hearing. The decision shall include a statement of the reasons for
the decision.
   (F)   The City Manager may decide the city will impose a lesser form of
discipline for the conduct at issue at the hearing.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.36.050 APPEALS.
   The affected employee may appeal a Step IV decision on a grievance, or any
decision made following a pre-disciplinary hearing by filing a written notice
of administrative appeal with the Superior Court. The Superior Court shall have
no jurisdiction to hear the appeal unless the employee files the notice of
appeal within 30 days after the employee’s receipt of either the Step IV
grievance decision or the pre-disciplinary hearing decision. The Superior Court
shall limit its review to whether or not substantial evidence in the record
supports the decision and to legal issues necessarily decided by the City
Manager or designee.

§ 3.40.010 OBJECTIVES OF PAY PLAN.
   The pay plan shall include the schedule of pay for all classes of positions
in the classification plans. The percentage amount of any pay increases to be
provided to any regular full time employee whose performance merits an increase
in pay shall be determined solely by the City Council and shall be accomplished
if at all, only by adoption of a non-code ordinance at the time the annual
budget ordinance is adopted. Each year at the time the annual budget is
initially presented to the City Council, the City Manager shall prepare a
written review of the overall economic conditions of the city and projected
economic conditions for the coming year. Said written review shall also contain
information regarding the annual inflation rate for Anchorage for the previous
year and any actual or anticipated increase in health insurance premiums and
shall make a specific recommendation as to whether the existing economic
conditions allow the city to provide a general merit increase to city employees
whose job performance merits an increase in pay during the upcoming fiscal
year.
(Am. Ord. 99-01, passed 3-9-99)
   The objectives of the plan are:
   (A)   To provide an appropriate salary structure to recruit and retain an
adequate supply of competent employees.
   (B)   To provide appropriate pay incentives for productivity and quality.
§ 3.40.020 REVIEW OF PAY PLAN.
   The City Manager shall periodically (but no less often than every three
years) review the pay plan and shall make a report to the City Council. The
purpose of such review and report shall be:
   (A)   To ascertain whether or not the pay plan accurately reflects existing
conditions; and
   (B)   To determine the accuracy of pay ranges.
The City Manager shall recommend to the City Council changes needed in the pay
plan to keep it current.
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19)
§ 3.40.030 PAY RANGES.

wage range through which an employee may progress. Pay ranges are assigned to
classes based upon the following factors:
   (A)   Duties and responsibilities of position or class;
   (B)   Internal equity-maintenance of pay ranges of classes in appropriate
relations to one another;
   (C)   Prevailing rates for comparable work in both public and private
employment, including comparative fringe benefits;
   (D)   Pay relationships between supervisors and employees;
   (E)   Employee recruitment and retention problems;
   (F)   Economic trends and forecasts; and
   (G)   Availability of funds.

§ 3.40.050 BASIS OF PAY RATES.
   (A)   Hiring wage rate.
      (1)   Appointment to any position can be made from the minimum to the
control point of the wage range based on the applicant’s experience and ability
over and above the qualification requirements specified for the class, prior
creditable city service, or on a critical shortage of applicants.
      (2)   Appointment above the control point of the wage range is allowed at
the Department Director level. Below the Department Director level, appointment
above the control point of the wage range is at the sole discretion of the City
Manager, with justification provided in writing.
      (3)   Written approval of the hiring wage rate shall be made by the City
Manager before appointment.
      (4)   Advancement to the maximum wage rate within a pay range shall be by
successive merit increases.
(Am. Ord. 99-01, passed 3-9-99)
   (B)   Promotion.
      (1)   Promotion which recognizes exceptional skill and qualifications.
Promotion is defined as the movement of an employee from one class and wage
range, to a different class at a higher wage range, as the result of being
selected for a position through the job posting process. Unless otherwise
provided in this subsection, for an employee who is promoted, the employee’s
wage rate in the new range can be made from the minimum to the midpoint of the
wage range, considering the employee’s qualifications, previous performance in
their current job, and those factors outlined in subsection (A). In no instance
shall an appointment be made above midpoint of the wage range, except to
executive positions or if the current wage of a non-executive employee who
accepts a promotion is above the midpoint of the new wage range. If the current
wage of an employee who accepts a promotion is above the midpoint of the new
wage range, and the employee is being promoted into a non-executive position,
the employee may receive up to a 3% increase from their current rate of pay.
Advancement to the maximum wage rate by subsequent promotion will be on the
same basis as described in §
3.40.060.
      (2)   Promotion following demotion in lieu of layoff.
         (a)   If an employee is promoted back to the employee’s former pay
range within one year following a demotion in lieu of layoff, the employee
shall be placed at that wage rate in the higher pay range which equates with
the employee’s pay rate prior to the demotion in lieu of layoff.
         (b)   If an employee is promoted within one year to a pay range lower
than that which applied before a demotion in lieu of layoff, the employee shall
be placed either at that wage rate in the new pay range which equates with the
pay rate prior to the demotion in lieu of layoff or to the maximum pay rate in
that new pay range, whichever is lower.
   (C)   Transfer.
      (1)   When an employee is assigned to a new position in the same class
and wage range and department, the employee shall be transferred at the same
pay rate received at the time of the transfer.
      (2)   When an employee is assigned to a new position in a different class
or department, but at the same wage range, the employee’s pay rate in the range
of the new position shall be the same pay rate received at the time of
transfer.
   (D)   Demotion. When an employee is demoted, the employee’s pay rate in the
range for the lower class shall be that pay rate which is determined by the
Department Director and the Personnel Officer, and approved by the City
Manager.
   (E)   Reclassification.
      (1)   An employee occupying a position which has been reclassified to a
class which carries a higher pay range shall be paid at a pay rate equal to or
greater than the employee’s pay rate prior to reclassification.
      (2)   When a position is reclassified to another class at the same level,
the employee shall have no change in status.
      (3)   An employee occupying a position which has been reclassified to a
class which carries a lower pay range shall be treated as follows:
         (a)   If the employee’s present pay rate is the same as that of any
pay rate in the lower range, he/she shall enter the lower range at that rate;
         (b)   If the present pay exceeds the maximum pay rate for the lower
class, the employee’s pay rate shall remain the same until the employee is
eligible for advancement within the pay range pursuant to §
3.40.050(B).
(Am. Ord. 2019-10, passed 9-10-19; Am. Ord. 2022-19, passed 12-27-22; Am. Ord.
2024-04, passed 3-12-24)
§ 3.40.060 ADVANCEMENTS WITHIN A PAY RANGE.
   On July 1 following the annual performance evaluation, an employee’s salary
may be increased by an amount previously approved by the City Council by non-
code ordinance for the applicable fiscal year. A merit increase must be earned
and is not granted automatically. Merit increases shall be based upon objective
evaluation of an employee’s work performance, recorded on a performance
evaluation report. When the overall report shows a satisfactory or higher
rating, and when it is shown that the employee has demonstrated satisfactory
performance of a progressively greater value to the city, a merit increase
shall be approved.
   (A)   Such advancement may be made annually until the employee has reached
the maximum pay rate of the salary range for the employee’s position. During a
year when the wage range is increased, employees hired between April 1 and June
30 shall also move up to the new minimum of the wage range on July 1, in which
case they will not be eligible for an increase on October 1.
   (B)   When an employee reaches the maximum pay rate in their pay range, or
if the percentage increase granted to other employees who are still within
their pay ranges will cause the employee to reach or exceed the maximum pay
rate in their pay range merit increases equal to one-half the percentage
increase granted to other employees who are still within their pay ranges may
be granted annually on July 1.
   (C)   When the Department Director determines that an employee has not
demonstrated satisfactory performance of a progressively greater value to the
city during the employee’s past merit anniversary year, the Department Director
may defer the merit increase for a stipulated time during which certain
specific improvements must be made, or deny the increase. Notice of such
deferral and reasons shall be given to the employee on the performance
evaluation report. The deferred merit increase may be approved any time during

consideration of the annual budget has authorized merit wage increases. Said
increases shall be limited to the amount provided by the City Council. When an
executive employee reaches the maximum pay rate in their pay range or if the
percentage increase granted to other employees who are still within their pay
ranges will cause the executive employee to reach or exceed the maximum pay
rate in their pay range, merit increases equal to one-half the percentage
increase granted to other employees who are still within their pay ranges may
be granted annually on July 1. During the first year of employment, an
executive employee will be advanced to a higher pay level on the July 1

and may be denied or delayed at the City Manager’s discretion based on
disciplinary actions or other considerations at the time of the proposed bonus.

      (1)   Reject defective or nonresponsive bids.
      (2)   Reject all bids.
      (3)   Negotiate with the three lowest responsible bidders, if bid prices
are in excess of the money available.
      (4)   Readvertise the project for bidding, after making substantial
changes in the project plans to bring the cost within the limit of the money
available.
   (B)   Negotiation. If the lowest and best bid exceeds the budgeted amount
and the City Council does not make additional funds available, the proposed
contract for purchase or sale or for services or for construction project shall
be reduced in scope sufficiently to bring the estimate of cost within the funds
available.
§ 6.24.050 BIDS; WAIVER OF IRREGULARITIES.
   The City Council shall have the authority to waive any and all
irregularities on any or all bids.
§ 6.24.060 AWARD OF CONTRACT TO LOWEST BIDDER; EXCEPTION.
   (A)   LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER. Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest
responsible bidder. In determining the lowest responsible bidder, in addition
to price, there shall be considered:
      (1)   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract.
      (2)   Whether the bidder can perform the contract within the time
specified, without delay or interference.
      (3)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder. When considering the character, integrity and
reputation of the bidder the City Council or its delegate may consider any past
conduct of the bidder which the City Council or its delegate in the exercise of
their discretion determines is evidence of poor character, integrity or
reputation sufficient to conclude that award of the contract to the low bidder
is not in the best interest of the citizens of Unalaska. This would include
past instances in which the bidder has submitted grossly inflated claims for
additional compensation for work done on a city project either as a
subcontractor or as a general contractor and past conduct of the bidder in
meetings with city employees or consultants.
      (4)   The quality of performance of previous contracts. In considering
the quality of performance of previous contracts the City Council or its
delegate may consider any of the following factors:
         (a)   Whether contracts were completed on time.
         (b)   Whether the bidder promptly corrected defective work.
         (c)   Whether the bidder fully performed the contract including
submission of as-built drawings.
         (d)   The number and validity of claims for additional compensation
submitted by the bidder.
         (e)   The conduct of the bidder during meetings with city employees
and consultants.
         (f)   Previously completed evaluations of bidder performance by any
city department.
      (5)   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and
ordinances relating to the contract.
      (6)   The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the
bidder to perform the contract.
      (7)   The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.
      (8)   Whether there are any unresolved claims between the bidder and the
City under any existing city contract in which the bidder is either a general
contractor or a subcontractor. Unresolved claims alone may be a sufficient
basis for an award to other than the low bidder.
   (B)   AWARD TO OTHER THAN LOW BIDDER. When the award is given to other than
the lowest bidder, a full and complete written statement of the reasons
therefore shall be delivered to the unsuccessful low bidder or bidders and
filed with the other papers relating to the transaction. The minutes of the
Council relating to the matter may be used as the required written statement.

exemption is sought. The City Council for good cause shown may waive the
claimant's failure to make timely application for the exemption for that year
and authorize the assessor to accept the application as if timely filed. The

same property under (A)(12), not more than two exemptions may be granted.

section, the following definitions apply to terms used in 43 U.S.C. 1620(d)
unless superseded by applicable federal law:
      (1)   "DEVELOPED" means a purposeful modification of the property from
its original state that effectuates a condition of gainful and productive
present use without further substantial modification, surveying, construction
of roads, providing utilities or other similar actions normally considered to
be component parts of the development process, but that do not create the
condition described in this subsection, do not constitute a developed state
within the meaning of this subsection developed property, in order to remove
the exemption, must be developed for purposes other than exploration, and be
limited to the smallest practicable tract of the property actually used in the
developed state.
      (2)   "EXPLORATION" means the examination and investigation of
undeveloped land to determine the existence of subsurface nonrenewable
resources.
      (3)   "LEASE" means a grant of primary possession entered into for
gainful purposes with a determinable fee remaining in the hands of the grantor
with respect to a lease that conveys rights of exploration and development,
this exemption shall continue with respect to that portion of the leased tract
that is used solely for the purpose of exploration.
      (4)   If property or an interest in property that is determined not to be
exempt under (A)(7) reverts to an undeveloped state, or if the lease is
terminated, the exemption shall be granted, subject to the provisions of (A)(7)
of this section.
   (F)   For the purpose of determining property exempt under (A)(8) of this
section:
      (1)   The date of subdivision shall be either the date of preliminary
approval of a plat by the platting authority or the date of recordation of a
final plat by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources;
      (2)   Lots for which the city completes the construction of required
improvements shall not be exempt; and
      (3)   Lots whose exemptions terminate prior to the due date for final
payment of tax shall not be subject to a pro rata payment of tax.
   (G)   For the purpose of determining eligibility for exemption under (A)(10)
of this section, a vessel must have been capable of safe navigation and
operation upon the waters of the city as of January 1 of the assessment year or

Civil Procedure) do not exempt the property from taxes levied and collected by

§ 6.32.010 FULL AND TRUE VALUE.
   (A)   The assessor shall assess property at its full and true value as of
January 1 of the assessment year, except as provided in this section. The full
and true value is the estimated price that the property would bring in an open
market and under the then prevailing market conditions in a sale between a
willing seller and a willing buyer both conversant with the property and with
prevailing general price levels.
   (B)   Assessment of business inventories, including supplies, may be based
on the estimated average monthly method of assessment rather than the value
existing on January 1. The Council may adopt regulations prescribing the method
of assessment of business inventories.
   (C)   In the case of cessation of business during the tax year, the
municipality may provide for reassessment of business inventories using the
average monthly method of assessment for the tax year rather than the value
existing on January 1 of the tax year, and for reduction and refund of taxes.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.32.015 METHOD OF DETERMINING THE FULL AND TRUE VALUE OF PROPERTY THAT
QUALIFIES FOR A LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT UNDER 26 USC 42.
   (A)   In accordance with AS 29.45.110(d)(1), the full and true value of all
property that first qualifies for low-income housing tax credit under 26 USC 42
before January 1, 2001, shall be based on the actual income derived from the
property and may not be adjusted based on the amount of any federal income tax
credit for the property.
   (B)   Pursuant to AS 29.45.110(d)(2), the full and true value of all
property within the city that first qualifies for a low-income housing credit
under 26 USC 42 on or after January 1, 2001, shall be exempt from the
requirement that the value be based on the actual income derived from the
property. For property that first qualifies for a low-income housing credit
under 26 USC 42 on or after January 1, 2001, the City Council shall determine,
by parcel, whether the full and true value of the property shall be assessed as
provided in §
6.32.010 or on the basis of actual income derived from the property without
adjustment based on the amount of any federal income tax credit given for the
property. Once the manner of assessment of the property has been determined
under this division, the manner of assessment of that parcel of property may
not change if debt relating to the property incurred in conjunction with the
property qualifying for the low-income housing tax credit remains outstanding.
   (C)   To secure an assessment based upon the actual income derived from the
property under this section, an owner of the property shall apply to the
assessor no later than March 1 of each year in which the assessment is desired.
The property owner shall submit an application on forms prescribed by the
assessor and shall include information that may reasonably be required by the
assessor to determine the entitlement of the applicant to an assessment of the
property under this section. Upon the first application received for a parcel
and following the assessor's determination of eligibility, the Council shall
make the determination of the method for assessing full and true value, as
described in division (B) of this section.
(Am. Ord. 2022-03, passed 2-22-22)
§ 6.32.020 RETURNS.
   (A)   Each person having ownership or control of or an interest in personal
property must submit a return in the form prescribed by the assessor, based on
property values existing on January 1, except as otherwise provided in this
Chapter.
   (B)   The assessor may, by written notice, require a person to provide
additional information within thirty (30) days.
   (C)   By no later than March 1st of each year every person or business
owning, or controlling in a representative capacity, any personal property
subject to personal property taxation shall submit to the assessor on forms
provided by the assessor a return of such property and the estimated values
existing as of January 1 in the same year. Business inventories and supplies
may be based on the estimated average monthly method of assessment as stated in
§
6.32.010(B). No extension of time for filing should be granted. This return
does not apply to motor vehicles required to be registered with the State
Department of Motor Vehicles.
   (D)   Penalty for failure to comply. Failure to file assessment returns as
required and within the time provided above or refusal to give other
information as required herein shall subject the violator to civil penalty as
provided in §
6.36.040.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03; Am. Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)
§ 6.32.030 INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   The assessor is not bound to accept a return as correct. The assessor
may make an independent investigation of property returned or of taxable
property on which no return has been filed. In either case, the assessor may
make the assessor's own valuation of the taxable property and this valuation is
prima facie evidence of the value of the property.
   (B)   For investigation, the assessor or the assessor’s agent may enter a
premise during reasonable hours and may examine property on the premise. The
assessor or the assessor’s agent may examine all property records involved. A
person shall, on request, furnish to the assessor or the assessor’s agent every
facility and assistance for the investigation. The assessor may seek a court
order to compel entry and production of records needed for assessment purposes.
   (C)   An assessor may examine a person on oath. On request, the person shall
submit to examination at a reasonable time and place selected by the assessor.
§ 6.32.040 VIOLATIONS.
   Any person who knowingly falsifies a property tax return or makes a false
affidavit to a statement required by a tax ordinance relative to the amount,
location, kind or value of property subject to taxation with intent to evade
the taxation is guilty of a minor offense punishable by a fine not to exceed
five hundred dollars ($500) per tax return filed or which should have been
filed, in addition to the penalty owed as a result of the failure to pay the
full amount of taxes owed.

Ord. 2016-16, passed 7-12-16)
§ 6.32.050 REEVALUATION.
   The assessor shall systematically reevaluate all taxable property with the
shortest practicable period of time. The Council may direct the assessor to
reevaluate a specific class of property or a specific location at any time.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.32.060 ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   (A)   The assessor shall prepare an annual assessment roll. The roll shall
contain:
      (1)   A description of all taxable property.
      (2)   The assessed value of all taxable property.
      (3)   The names and addresses of persons with property subject to
assessment and taxation.
      (4)   The assessor may list real property by any description that may be
made certain. Real property is assessed to the record owner. Other persons
having an interest in the property may be listed on the assessment records with
the record owner. The person in whose name property is listed as record owner
is conclusively presumed to be the legal record owner. If the property owner is
unknown, the property may be assessed to unknown owner. An assessment is not
invalidated by a mistake, omission, or error in the name of the record owner,
if the property is correctly described.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.32.070 ASSESSMENT NOTICE.
   (A)   The City Clerk or designee shall give each person named in the
assessment roll a notice of assessment, showing the assessed value of the
person's property. On each notice is printed a brief summary of the dates when
taxes are payable, delinquent, and subject to penalty and interest, and the
dates when the Board of Equalization will sit.
   (B)   Sufficient assessment notice is given if mailed by first class mail
thirty (30) days before the equalization hearings. If the address is not known
to the assessor, the notice may be addressed to the person at the post office
nearest the property. Notice is effective on the date of mailing.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.32.080 CORRECTIONS.
   (A)   A person receiving an assessment notice shall advise the assessor of
errors or omissions in the assessment of the person's property. The assessor
may correct errors or omissions in the roll before the Board of Equalization
hearing.
   (B)   If errors found in the preparation of the assessment roll are
adjusted, the assessor shall mail a corrected notice allowing thirty (30) days
for appeal to the Board of Equalization.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.32.090 APPEAL.
   (A)   A person whose name appears on the assessment roll or the agent or the
assigns of that person may appeal to the Board of Equalization for relief from
an alleged error in valuation not adjusted by the assessor to the taxpayer’s
satisfaction.
   (B)   The appellant shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing
of notice of assessment, submit to the assessor a written appeal specifying
grounds in the form that the Board of Equalization may require. Otherwise, the
right of appeal ceases unless the Board of Equalization finds that the taxpayer
was unable to comply.
   (C)   The assessor shall notify an appellant by mail of the time and place
of hearing.
   (D)   The assessor shall prepare for use by the Board of Equalization a
summary of assessment data relating to each assessment that is appealed.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.32.100 BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.
   (A)   The City Council sits as a Board of Equalization for the purpose of
hearing an appeal from a determination of the assessor, or it may delegate this
authority to one (1) or more boards appointed by it. An appointed board may be
composed of not less than three (3) persons, who may be members of the City
Council and residents. The City Council shall by ordinance establish the
qualifications for membership.
   (B)   The Board of Equalization is governed in its proceedings by rules
adopted by ordinance that are consistent with general rules of administrative
procedure. The board may alter an assessment of a lot only pursuant to an
appeal filed as to the particular lot.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)

§ 6.36.010 VALIDITY OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   An assessment roll as completed and certified by the City Council, and as
corrected and amended by the assessor in conformity with the applicable
provisions of this Chapter and the Alaska Statutes and the decisions of the
Council acting as the Board of Equalization are, except as amended as a result
of an appeal to the court, valid and binding on all persons notwithstanding any
defect, error, omission or invalidity in the assessment roll, or proceedings
pertaining to the assessment roll.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.36.020 DUE DATE.
   Taxes become due and are delinquent on dates set yearly by resolution. For
purposes of this Chapter, payment post marked on, or before, the due date shall
be considered evidence of timely payment.
(Ordinance No. 88-23)
§ 6.36.030 TAX LIABILITY.
   (A)   The owner of personal property assessed is personally liable for the
amount of taxes assessed against their or the owner's property, and shall
constitute a lien upon the property assessed.
   (B)   Real property taxes, together with penalty and interest, are a lien
upon the property assessed, and the lien is prior and paramount to all other
liens or encumbrances against the property.
   (C)   Failure to receive a tax bill does not relieve taxpayer of
responsibility to pay when tax is due.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.36.040 RATES OF PENALTY AND INTEREST; PRIORITY FOR CREDITING PAYMENTS.
   If the taxes are not paid when due and become delinquent, a penalty of ten
percent (10%) of the delinquent tax for the current year shall be added to all
delinquent taxes, and interest at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum
shall be charged on all of the unpaid taxes, not including the penalty, from
the due date until paid in full. All payments made for taxes, penalties and
interest shall be credited first to the past due penalty, then to the past due
interest, then to the past-due taxes and then to the current taxes, in that
order. If a taxpayer is given the right to pay the tax in two installments,
penalty and interest on an unpaid installment accrues from the date the
installment becomes due.
(Am. Ord. 2001-24, passed 11-13-01; Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6- 03; Am.
Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)

due referred to in §

(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.36.060 METHODS OF COLLECTION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES.
   Delinquent personal property taxes together with the penalty and interest,
may be collected either by distraint or in a personal action brought in the
name of the City against the owner, or both such methods of collection may be
used, in the discretion of the Council. Neither methods of collection shall be
deemed exclusive.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.36.070 COLLECTION BY DISTRAINT AND SALE.
   (A)   PERSONS SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT: If, at any time, a taxpayer is more
than six (6) months delinquent in payment of personal property taxes due to the
City, the taxpayer shall be subject to distraint and sale or a personal action
to collect the debt which procedures are in addition to any other method of
collection already provided for in this Chapter or allowed by State law.
   (B)   DISTRAINT: The lien of personal property taxes may be enforced by
distraint and sale of the personal property of the person assessed. The
procedure shall be as follows:
      (1)   The City Clerk or designee shall make demand to the person or
entity assessed by sending a notice of the amount of the tax, the penalty and
interest due, and the total amount due to the delinquent taxpayer at their last
known address. This notice must also state that if the taxes and all penalty
and interest are not paid by a date certain, which date shall not be less than
thirty (30) days from the date of mailing, that their personal property shall
be subject to distraint and sale. The notice shall be sent by first class mail
or delivered in person to the person or entity assessed. If the notices are
served in person, the person serving the notices shall file with the City Clerk
a proof of service.
      (2)   If no payment is made within the time specified, the City Clerk or
designee shall issue a warrant directed to the Department of Public Safety
directing it to seize, levy, distrain, and sell by public auction such personal
property of the person or entity assessed upon which the tax was levied upon.
If the expected sale proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy the tax, penalty,
interest, costs, and expenses of sale, such warrant may authorize the seizure,
levy, distraint and sale of such other personal property of the person or
entity against whom the tax was assessed as may be sufficient to satisfy such
tax, penalty, interest, costs and expenses of sale.
      (3)   No sale of any personal property may be made without at least
fifteen (15) days notice being given by publishing a notice of the sale at
least two (2) times in a newspaper of general circulation within the City or if
there is no such newspaper, by posting the notice within the time stated in ten
(10) public places within the City. The notice shall also be mailed by first-
class mail, or delivered in person or entity assessed.
      (4)   Redemption: After the personal property is seized by the City, the
delinquent taxpayer may redeem their personal property seized by payment in
full of their proportionate share of the costs of distraint, the actual costs
of storage of the property along with the penalty, interest and tax due as of
the date of redemption.
      (5)   Sale: The sale of such personal property shall be made at public
auction and such personal property shall be sold to the highest bidder for cash
or certified check. All sales of personal property shall be made at a time of
day to be fixed by the City Clerk or designee in such notice, and the same
shall be fixed between the hours of ten (10) a.m. and five (5) p.m. of the day
of sale, and the sale may be adjourned from day to day for want of purchasers
or sufficient bids, or if for any valid reason the City Clerk or designee is
prevented from attending at the time and place set for the sale, the sale may
be adjourned and continued from day to day if necessary until all of such
personal property has been sold to pay the costs and expenses herein provided,
and the tax, penalty and interest in full. Upon sale, all rights, title and
interest of the delinquent taxpayer is conveyed to the successful bidder upon
payment in full.
      (6)   The City shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the following
order, to the actual expenses of sale, (including, but not limited to, storage
costs, attorney's fees and costs, costs of publication, posting, mailing,
copying and costs of additional insurance) penalty and tax due. The City Clerk
shall keep a record of all such sales and proceedings, and shall keep on file
all records. In all cases of sale of personal property, the City Clerk or
designee shall, if requested, give the purchaser a bill of sale on behalf of
the City.
      (7)   Any remaining sums shall be returned to the person or entity
assessed, upon written claim by the former property owner or, if not claimed
within six (6) months by the former property owner, said sums shall become the
property of the City.

§ 6.36.090 ACTION FOR COLLECTION OF TAX AGAINST REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   If the tax on real property is not paid when due, the Council shall
address such delinquencies as required in this Chapter. Unless other measures
are specifically allowed by the Council, the Council shall direct the City
Clerk to enforce the lien of the tax by foreclosure.
   (B)   If the tax on a leasehold interest or other taxable interest in tax
exempt property is not paid when due, the City may enforce the tax by a
personal action against the delinquent taxpayer brought in the proper court, in
addition to other remedies available to the City to enforce the lien.

§ 6.36.150 ANSWER AND OBJECTION.
   A person having an interest in a parcel on the foreclosure list may file an
answer within thirty (30) days of the date of last publication, specifying the

the tax is valid and the tax is unpaid.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.36.160 REDEMPTION PERIOD.
   (A)   Properties transferred to the City are held by the City for at least

receipt for payment constitutes an additional lien on the property, collectible
by the lienholder in the same manner as the original lien.
§ 6.36.190 POSSESSION DURING REDEMPTION PERIOD.
   Foreclosure does not affect the former owner's right to possession during
the redemption period. In the event that waste is committed by the former
owner, or by anyone acting under his permission or control, the City may
declare an immediate forfeiture of the right to possession.
(Am. Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)

sale which exceeds the amount sufficient to satisfy unpaid taxes, delinquent
taxes assessed and levied as if the property had continued in private
ownership, penalty, interest, and costs of property sold, including costs
incurred under §
6.36.200(A). If the proceeds of the sale of tax-foreclosed property exceed the
total of unpaid and delinquent taxes, penalty, interest, and costs, the City
shall provide the former owner of the property written notice advising of the
amount of the excess and the manner in which a claim for the balance of the
proceeds may be submitted. Notice is sufficient under this subsection if mailed
to the former record owner at the last address of record. Upon presentation of
a proper claim, the City shall remit the excess to the former record owner. A
claim for the excess filed after six (6) months of the date of the sale is
forever barred.

the account in question, is satisfied that this is the case, the City shall
refund the excess to the taxpayer with interest at the rate of eight percent
(8%) per annum from the date of payment. A claim or refund filed after one (1)
year of the due date is forever barred.

         (a)   The consumer believes the sale to be excepted or exempt from
taxation; and
         (b)   The consumer has paid the sales tax levied by the City at the
time of the sale; and
         (c)   The consumer files the application with the City within one (1)
year of the date of the sale on a form prescribed by the City containing the
names of the seller and the consumer, the items purchased, the date, the price,
the amount of tax paid, and a brief statement of the claim of exemption. A copy
of the invoice or sales receipt must be attached to the refund application.
      (2)   This subsection does not apply to refund claims based upon the
consumer’s status as a senior citizen.
   (B)   COLLECTOR: OVER PAYMENT REFUND. If a collector has remitted sales tax
in excess of what is due to the City, the collector may apply to the City for a
refund within one (1) year of the date the overpayment was made. The City shall
audit the collector’s account and may request any additional information the
City requires to determine that a refund is due. If the City determines that a
refund is due, the collector may take a credit on the next sales tax report, or
the City shall pay the refund of the tax paid with interest at three and one-
half percent (3.5%) per annum beginning thirty (30) days from the date of
payment of the tax to the City. A claim for refund not filed within one (1)
year of the date the tax was remitted to the City is forever barred. A
collector may claim a refund only where the collector has filed a timely sales
tax return and therewith remitted the sales taxes due under that return. This
section does not apply to claims for exemptions for sale for resale for which
any refund claim should be made pursuant to §
6.40.050(A). Interest will not be paid on any tax refund.
   (C)   SENIOR CITIZEN REFUND. Natural persons of at least sixty- five (65)
years of age on or before March 31 of each year shall be entitled to receive a
yearly sales tax refund in the amount of four hundred dollars ($400).
      (1)   To be eligible for the refund, the consumer must be sixty-five (65)
years of age or older by March 31 of each year, be a resident of the City for
at least thirty (30) days prior to their application, and file a timely
application for refund with the City. The application form may require the
consumer-applicant to provide proof of age and of residency, along, with other
information reasonably necessary to administer this refund. The claim for
refund may be made only by filing a timely application with the City Clerk.
      (2)   An application for a senior citizen refund must be filed with the
City between January 1 and March 31 of each year. Claims for refund filed after
March 31 of each year shall be denied.
      (3)   Any eligible applicant who has a delinquent account of any kind
with the City shall not be entitled to receive their refund directly. The City
shall, instead, apply the refund to the delinquency. Only once the delinquency
is paid may any surplus refund be directed to the eligible recipient.
      (4)   “Resident of the City,” for the purposes of this subsection, means
a person who is physically present in the City with the intent to remain
indefinitely in the City and to make a home in the City. The individual must
also have maintained a principal place of abode in the City for at least thirty
(30) consecutive days immediately preceding the date of application for a
refund. A person demonstrates the intent required under this section through
establishing and maintaining customary ties indicative of residence in the City
and through the absence of those ties elsewhere. Physical presence in the City
is not, by itself, sufficient to establish residency.
      (5)   Applicants shall prove residency in Unalaska by providing to the
City Clerk evidence of either current voter registration in the State of
Alaska, at an address in Unalaska, or evidence of approved eligibility for the

the consumer believes the sale is exempt, but was not provided an exemption at
point of sale.

   (A)   A collector shall add the sales tax levied in accordance with §
6.40.020 to the selling price which the collector collects at the time of the
sale or at the time of collection with respect to credit transactions. The tax
is a debt from the consumer to the collector until paid and is recoverable at
law in the same manner as other debts. Notwithstanding the liability of the
consumer, taxes collected or which should have been collected by the collector
under this Chapter are monies of the City for which the collector is at all
times liable to the City.
   (B)   Collectors shall add the tax levied in this Chapter to the selling
price, rent or service charge in accordance with this Chapter, showing the tax
as a separate and distinct item. The tax imposed on the sale of more than one
separately priced item may be shown as a total tax on the aggregate price of
all items purchased and delivered at one time.
   (C)   The sales tax may be included in the selling price of sales made
through coin-operated devices, sales of food and beverages at concession stands
and other places with high customer volume, metered sales where the sales price
is computed by the metering device, admissions, and other taxable sales where
the City determines buyer and seller convenience would be substantially
enhanced, upon written authorization from the City. A notice explaining that
the sales tax is included in the selling price will be posted at the premises,
or on the device.

   (B)   ITINERANT SELLER. A person doing business within the City who is

any event prior to leaving the City.
   (C)   SALE OF BUSINESS ASSETS TO ANOTHER. A collector who sells their
business, business inventory, or accounts receivable to another shall make a
final sales tax return within fifteen (15) days after the date of sale. The
purchaser of the business, business inventory, or accounts receivable shall
withhold a portion of the purchase money sufficient to pay the sales tax,
penalties and interest that may be due until the seller displays a receipt from
the City showing that all tax obligations imposed by this Chapter have been
paid. If any purchaser of a business, business inventory, or accounts
receivable fails to withhold this sum, the purchaser shall be personally liable
for the taxes, penalties and interest owed by the seller to the City. The City
may continue to make efforts to collect the tax from the person or entity who
owned the business or accounts receivables at the time the liability was
incurred.
   (D)   UPON TERMINATION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. If a collector terminates
their business without the benefit of a purchaser, successor, successors or
assigns, the collector shall make a final return and settlement of tax
obligations within fifteen (15) days of the termination of business.

return will be presumed to be making sales in successive quarters unless that
collector files a return showing termination or sale of the business.

maintain in a current condition the books and records that contain the
information required to complete the return;
   (B)   Such extension is a dire necessity for bookkeeping reasons and would
avert undue hardship upon the seller;
   (C)   The seller has a plan to cure the problem that caused the seller to
apply for an extension and the seller agrees to proceed with diligence to cure
the problem;
   (D)   At the time of the application, the seller is not delinquent in filing
any other sales tax return, in remitting sales tax to the City or otherwise in
violation of this chapter; and
   (E)   No such extension shall be made retroactively to cover existing
delinquencies.
(Am. Ord. 2020-7; passed 4-28-20)
§ 6.40.097 CESSATION OR TRANSFER OF BUSINESS.
   (A)   A seller who sells, leases, conveys, forfeits, transfers or assigns
the majority of their business interest, including a creditor or secured party,
shall make a final sales tax return within 30 days after the date of such
conveyance.
   (B)   At least ten business days before any such sale is completed, the
seller shall send to the city clerk, by approved communication (email
confirmation, certified first-class mail, postage prepaid) a notice that the
seller's interest is to be conveyed and shall include the name, address and
telephone number of the person or entity to whom the interest is to be
conveyed.
   (C)   Upon notice of sale and disclosure of buyer, the City shall be
authorized to disclose the status of the seller's sales tax account to the
named buyer or assignee.
   (D)   Upon receipt of notice of a sale or transfer, the City shall send the
transferee a copy of this code with this section highlighted.
   (E)   Neither the City's failure to give the notice nor the transferee's
failure to receive the notice shall relieve the transferee of any obligations
under this section.
   (F)   Following receipt of the notice, the City shall have 60 days in which
to perform a final sales tax audit and assess sales tax liability against the
seller of the business. If the notice is not mailed at least ten business days
before the sale is completed, the City shall have 12 months from the date of
the completion of the sale or the City's knowledge of the completion of the
sale within which to begin a final sales tax audit and assess sales tax
liability against the seller of the business. The City may also initiate an
estimated assessment if the requirements for such an assessment exist.
   (G)   A person acquiring any interest of a seller in a business required to
collect the tax under this chapter assumes the liability of the seller for all
taxes due the City, whether current or delinquent, whether known to the City or
discovered later, and for all interest, penalties, costs and charges on such
taxes.
   (H)   Before the effective date of the transfer, the transferee of a
business shall obtain from the City an estimate of the delinquent sales tax,
penalty and interest, if any, owed by the seller as of the date of the
transfer, and shall withhold that amount from the consideration payable for the
transfer, until the seller has produced a receipt from the City showing that
all tax obligations imposed by this chapter have been paid. A transferee that
fails to withhold the amount required under this subsection shall be liable to
the City for the lesser of the amount of delinquent sales tax, penalty and
interest due from the seller as of the date of transfer, and the amount that
the transferee was required to withhold.
   (I)   In this section, the term "transfer" includes the following:
      (1)   A change in voting control, or in more than fifty percent (50%) of
the ownership interest in a seller that is a corporation, limited liability
company or partnership; or
      (2)   A sale of all or substantially all the assets used in the business
of the seller; or
      (3)   The initiation of a lease, management agreement or other
arrangement under which another person becomes entitled to the remote seller's
or marketplace facilitator's gross receipts from sales, rentals or services.
   (J)   Subsection H of this section shall not apply to any person who
acquires their ownership interest in the ongoing business as a result of the
foreclosure of a lien that has priority over the City's sales tax lien.
   (K)    A seller who terminates the business without the benefit of a
purchaser, successor or assign shall make a final tax return and settlement of
tax obligations within 30 days after such termination. If a final return and
settlement are not received within 30 days of the termination, the seller shall
pay a penalty of $100, plus an additional penalty of $25 for each additional 30
day period, or part of such a period, during which the final return and
settlement have not been made, for a maximum of six additional periods.
(Am. Ord. 2020-7; passed 4-28-20)
§ 6.40.100 PROCEDURES ON DELINQUENCIES.
   (A)   PENALTY.
      (1)   A penalty equal to five percent (5%) of the delinquent tax shall be
added to the tax for the first month, or any part thereof, and an additional
five percent (5%) shall be added to the tax due for each month, or fraction
thereof, of delinquency until a total penalty of twenty percent (20%) of the
sales tax due has accrued. The penalty shall be assessed and collected in the
same manner as the tax is assessed and collected. The penalty does not bear
interest.
      (2)   A late filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25) per month, or
fraction thereof, shall be added to all late-filed sales tax reports, until a
total of one hundred dollars ($100) has been reached. An incomplete return
shall be treated as the filing of no return.
   (B)   INTEREST. In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (A) above,
interest assessed on delinquent tax shall accrue at the rate of fifteen percent
(15%) per annum. Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency until paid
in full and shall be collected in the same manner as the delinquent tax is
collected.
   (C)   PRIORITY FOR CREDITING PAYMENTS. All payments received shall be
applied in the following order:
      (1) Penalties due, beginning with the oldest penalty;
      (2) Interest due, beginning with the interest due on the oldest month;
and
      (3) Taxes due, beginning with the taxes due from the oldest month.
   (D)   WRITTEN DEMAND AND ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES. If a collector fails to file
the return or make the remittance in accordance with §§
6.40.070 or
6.40.080, the City may do any or all of the following things:
      (1)   Cite the offender for a violation of this chapter. Any person,
firm, or entity violating any provision of this chapter is guilty of a minor
offense and shall be subject to a penalty as provided in §
1.24.040 or if no fine is there established, in an amount not to exceed $500
for each violation or day a violation exists. In all cases where a person is
found to have violated this chapter, the court shall order the person to file
an accurate sales tax return within fifteen (15) days, in addition to any fine
that may be imposed as a result of the violation. Prosecution under this
subsection does not limit the ability of the City to recover any amount of
unpaid taxes through civil action or as otherwise provided by this chapter.
      (2)   Civil action. File a civil complaint against the collector for
violation of any obligation in this Chapter.
      (3)   Make a sales tax assessment against the collector, with the
assessment based upon an estimate of the gross revenue received by the
collector during the period and institute civil action to recover the amount of
the sales tax, interest, and penalty due and to request injunctive relief. The
estimate of gross revenue may all be derived from past sales tax returns of the
seller or their predecessor, the general economic level of the business
community, information from sales tax audits conducted by the City, if
available, returns of comparable businesses and any other information believed
to be reliable or helpful to the City in making an estimate of the sales tax
due. Notice of the estimated assessment of sales taxes due shall be furnished
the collector by the City via first-class mail to the last known address of the
collector or via hand-delivery to the collector and the estimated assessment
shall become final for the purposes of determining liability of the collector
to the City after thirty (30) days of the date of mailing or hand-delivery of
the estimated assessment to the collector unless the collector earlier files
with the City an accurate sales tax return, supported by satisfactory records
or documentation of sales made, indicating a lesser liability.
      (4)   The tax, interest and penalty imposed under this Chapter shall
constitute a lien in favor of the City upon all the property of the collector
or taxpayer whether tangible or intangible and wherever located. The lien
arises upon delinquency and continues until the liability is satisfied or the
lien is foreclosed. The lien is not valid as against a mortgagee, pledgee,
purchaser or judgment lien creditor until notice of the lien is filed in the
office of the recorder for the Aleutian Islands or Anchorage recording
district. The manner provided for Federal tax liens under AS 40.19.010 et seq.
are by this reference incorporated herein as if set forth in full.
   (E)   WAIVER. A penalty assessed under this section for the delinquent
remittance of sales tax or failure to file a sales tax return may be waived by
the City Manager, upon written application of the seller accompanied by a
payment of all delinquent sales tax, interest and penalty otherwise owed by the
seller, within 45 calendar days after the date of delinquency. A seller may not
be granted more than one waiver of penalty under this subsection in any one
calendar year. The City Manager shall report such waivers of penalty to the
City Council, in writing.

seller. No repayment plan shall be valid unless agreed to by both parties in
writing.
   (B)   A seller shall not be eligible to enter into a repayment plan with the
City if the seller has defaulted on a repayment plan in the previous two
calendar years.
   (C)   The repayment plan shall include a secured promissory note that
substantially complies with the following terms:
      (1)   The seller agrees to pay a minimum of 10% down payment on the tax,
interest and penalty amount due. The down payment shall be applied first to
penalty, then to accumulated interest, and then to the tax owed.
      (2)   The seller agrees to pay the balance of the tax, penalty and
interest owed in monthly installments over a period not to exceed two years.
      (3)   Interest at a rate of 15% per annum shall accrue on the principal
sum due. Interest shall not apply to penalties owed or to interest accrued at
the time the repayment plan is executed or accruing during the term of the
repayment plan.
      (4)   If the seller is a corporation or a limited liability entity the
seller agrees to provide a personal guarantee of the obligations under the
repayment plan.
      (5)   The seller agrees to pay all future tax bills in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   The seller agrees to provide a security interest in the form of a
sales tax lien for the entire unpaid balance of the promissory note to be
recorded by the City at the time the repayment plan is signed. The seller shall
be responsible for the cost of recording the tax lien.
   (D)   If a seller fails to pay two or more payments as required by the
repayment plan agreement, the seller shall be in default and the entire amount
owed at the time of default shall become immediately due. The City will send
the seller a notice of default. The City may immediately foreclose on the sales
tax lien or take any other remedy available under the law.
(Am. Ord. 2020-07, passed 4-28-20)
§ 6.40.110 PERIOD OF LIMITATION.
   (A)   The amount of any sales tax imposed under this Chapter may be
determined and assessed at any time within a period of six (6) years after the
sale tax became due and payable. The period shall begin on the date when a
return is required to be filed. Where no sales tax return has been filed, or
where a fraudulent return has been filed, then the period of limitation does
not begin to run until discovery of the delinquency or fraud occurs. No
proceeding for the collection of the sales tax shall be begun after the
expiration of this period.
   (B)   No obligation to collect tax established by §
6.40.010(C)(1)(b) shall be applied retroactively.

sales tax returns, reports, forms, records and supporting schedules as may be
necessary to determine the amount of tax required to be collected.
   (B)   Every consumer shall retain for a period of six (6) years all of the
receipts for all sales for which the consumer claimed an exemption and any

made available for examination at reasonable times by the City or agents of the
City, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a return for the
purpose of determining the amount of tax collected or levied.

benefit of the City and is liable to the City for the full amount collected
plus any accrued penalties and interest on the amount collected.
   (B)   Persons owning stock of ten percent (10%) or more of the total of
corporations or ten percent (10%) interest in limited liability companies with
thirty-five (35) or fewer owners and exercising responsibility for fiscal
management, shall be jointly and severally liable for sales taxes levied or
otherwise required to be collected or paid to the City by such corporations or
limited liability company when such taxes become due and unpaid to the extent
that such taxes accrued while such person was exercising responsibility for
fiscal management.
   (C)   The dissolution of a corporation, limited liability company, limited
partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited
partnership does not discharge an officer, member-manager, manager, or
partner’s liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited liability
company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited
liability limited partnership to file a return or remit the tax due. The sum
due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law.
   (D)   If the corporate officers, limited liability company member-managers
or managers, or partners elect not to be personally liable for the failure to
file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation, limited
liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or
limited liability limited partnership shall provide the City with a surety bond
or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become
due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be
in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross sales multiplied by the
applicable sales tax rate.
   (E)   Upon the termination, dissolution, or abandonment of the business of a
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
or limited liability company, any officer, member, manager, partner, or other

liability partnership, or limited liability company in complying with any
requirement of this Chapter, and who is not jointly and severally liable under

penalties on those taxes, if the officer, member, manager, partner, or other
person willfully fails to pay or to cause to be paid any taxes due from the
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
or limited liability company pursuant to this part.
   (F)   The officer, member, manager, partner, or other person liable under §
6.40.130(E) shall be liable only for taxes that became due during the period he
or she had the control, supervision, responsibility, or duty to act for the
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
or limited liability company, plus interest and penalties on those taxes.
   (G)   Personal liability may be imposed pursuant to this section only if the
City can establish that the corporation, partnership, limited partnership,
limited liability partnership, or limited liability company had included tax
reimbursement in the selling price of, or added tax reimbursement to the
selling price of, tangible personal property sold in the conduct of its
business, or when it can be established that the corporation, partnership,
limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability
company made a purchase subject to tax and failed to pay the tax.
   (H)   For purposes of this section, “willfully fails to pay or to cause to
be paid” means that the failure was the result of an intentional, conscious,

§ 6.40.135 WITHHOLDING OF PERSONAL PROPERTY OF TAXPAYER OR EMPLOYER FAILING TO
WITHHOLD; NOTICE; DESIGNATION OF ADDRESS OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION; LIQUIDATION
OF FINANCIAL ASSETS; LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO WITHHOLD.
   (A)   The City Manager may by notice, served personally or by first-class
mail, require any employer, person, officer or department of the state,
political subdivision or agency of the state, having in their possession, or
under their control, any credits or other personal property or other things of
value, belonging to a taxpayer or to an officer of a person liable for unpaid
tax under §
6.40.130 of this Chapter or person who has failed to withhold and transmit
amounts due pursuant to this section, to withhold, from the credits or other
personal property or other things of value, the amount of any tax, interest, or
penalties due from the taxpayer or the amount of any liability incurred by that
person for failure to withhold and transmit amounts due from a taxpayer and to
transmit the amount withheld to the City at the times that the City Manager may
designate. However, in the case of a depository institution, as defined in § 19
(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C.A. § 461(b)(1)(A)), amounts due from a
taxpayer under this section shall be transmitted to the City not less than ten
business days from receipt of the notice. To be effective, the notice shall
state the amount due from the taxpayer and shall be delivered or mailed to any
branch or office where the City Manager reasonably believes credits or other
property is held.
   (B)   When the City, pursuant to this section issues a levy upon, or
requires by notice, any person, or financial institution, as applicable, to
withhold all, or a portion of, a financial asset for the purpose of collecting
a delinquent tax liability, the person, or financial institution, that
maintains, administers, or manages that asset on behalf of the taxpayer, or has
the legal authority to accept instructions from the taxpayer as to the
disposition of that asset, shall liquidate the financial asset in a
commercially reasonable manner within 90 days of the issuance of the order to
withhold. Within five days of liquidation, the person, or financial
institution, as applicable, shall remit to the City the proceeds of the
liquidation, less any reasonable commissions or fees, or both, which are
charged in the normal course of business.
   (C)   If the value of the financial assets to be liquidated exceeds the tax
liability, the taxpayer may, within 60 days after the service of the order to
withhold upon the person, or financial institution, instruct the person, or
financial institution, as to which financial assets are to be sold to satisfy
the tax liability. If the taxpayer does not provide instructions for
liquidation, the person, financial institution, or securities intermediary
shall liquidate the financial assets in a commercially reasonable manner and in
an amount sufficient to cover the tax liability, and any reasonable commissions
or fees, or both, which are charged in the normal course of business, beginning
with the financial assets purchased most recently.
   (D)   Any corporation or person failing to withhold the amounts due from any
taxpayer and transmit them to the City after service of the notice shall be
liable for those amounts. However, in the case of a depository institution, if
a notice to withhold is mailed to the branch where the account is located or
principal banking office, the depository institution shall be liable for a
failure to withhold only to the extent that the accounts can be identified in
information normally maintained at that location in the ordinary course of
business.

appropriate to administer this Chapter which includes the authority to enter
into payment plans for delinquent sales taxes, penalties and interest.

for which the collector is at all times liable to the City.
   (B)   Collectors shall add the tax levied in this Chapter to the selling
price in accordance with this Chapter, showing the tax as a separate and
distinct item. The tax imposed on the sale of more than one separately priced

this Chapter and all data obtained from such returns are confidential, and such
returns, and data obtained shall be kept from inspection by all private
persons, except as necessary to investigate and prosecute violations of this
Chapter. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to prohibit the

percent (2%) of the gross raw seafood sales tax collected, provided that the

(Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.44.120 PROCEDURES ON DELINQUENCIES.
   (A)   PENALTY. A penalty equal to five percent (5%) of the delinquent tax
shall be added to the tax for the first month, or any part thereof, and an
additional five percent (5%) shall be added to the tax due for each month, or
fraction thereof, of delinquency until a total penalty of fifteen percent (15%)

same manner as the tax is assessed and collected.
   (B)   INTEREST. In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (A) above,

(10%) per year. Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency until paid

   (D)   WRITTEN DEMAND AND ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES. If a collector fails to file

      (2)   Civil action. File a civil complaint against the seller or
collector for violation of any obligation in this Chapter.
      (3)   Make a tax assessment against the collector, with the assessment
based upon an estimate of the gross purchases made by the collector during the
period and institute civil action to recover the amount of the tax, interest,
and penalty due and to request injunctive relief. The estimate of gross
purchases may all be derived from past tax returns of the purchaser or their
predecessor, the general economic level of the business community, information
from tax audits conducted by the City, if available, returns of comparable
businesses and any other information believed to be reliable or helpful to the
City in making an estimate of the tax due. Notice of the estimated assessment
of taxes due shall be furnished to the collector by the City via first-class
mail to the last known address of the collector or via hand-delivery to the
collector and the estimated assessment shall become final for the purposes of
determining liability of the collector to the City after thirty (30) days of
the date of mailing or hand-delivery of the estimated assessment to the
collector unless the collector earlier files with the City an accurate tax
return, supported by satisfactory records or documentation of purchases made,
indicating a lesser liability.
      (4) The tax, interest and penalty imposed under this Chapter shall
constitute a lien in favor of the City upon all the property of the collector.
The lien arises upon delinquency and continues until the liability is satisfied
or the lien is foreclosed. The lien is not valid as against a mortgagee,
pledgee, purchaser or judgment lien creditor until notice of the lien is filed
in the office of the recorder for the recording district. The manner provided
for federal tax liens under AS 40.19.010 et seq. are by this reference
incorporated herein as if set forth in full.

assessed at any time within a period of six (6) years after the tax became due
and payable. The period shall begin on the date when a return is required to be
filed. Where no tax return has been filed, or where a fraudulent return has
been filed, then the period of limitation does not begin to run until discovery
of the delinquency or fraud occurs. No proceeding for the collection of the tax
shall be begun after the expiration of this period.
(Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.44.140 RECORD KEEPING AND AUDIT.
   Every collector shall retain for a period of six (6) years all of the tax
returns for purchases of raw seafood product, reports, forms, records and
supporting schedules as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax
required to be collected. All such records and documentation shall be made
available for examination at reasonable times by the City or agents of the City
for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a return or for the purpose
of determining the amount of tax collected or levied.
(Ord. No. 2003-05, passed 5-6-03)
§ 6.44.150 TAX RULINGS.
   (A)   The City Manager or their designee may rule upon specific transactions

relied upon by the parties to that sale unless essential facts were not

   (B)   The City Manager or their designee shall take all steps necessary and
appropriate to administer this Chapter which includes the authority to enter

benefit of the City and is liable to the City for the full amount collected
plus any accrued penalties and interest on the amount collected.
   (B)   Persons owning stock of ten percent (10%) or more of the total of
corporations or ten percent (10%) interest in limited liability companies with
thirty-five (35) or fewer owners and exercising responsibility for fiscal
management, shall be jointly and severally liable for raw seafood product sales
taxes levied or otherwise required to be collected or paid to the City by such
corporation or limited liability company when such taxes become due and unpaid
to the extent that such taxes accrued while such person was exercising
responsibility for fiscal management.
   (C)   The dissolution of a corporation, limited liability company, limited
partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited
partnership does not discharge an officer, member-manager, manager, or
partner's liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited liability
company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited
liability limited partnership to file a return or remit the tax due. The sum
due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law.
   (D)   If the corporate officers, limited liability company member-managers
or managers, or partners elect not to be personally liable for the failure to
file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation, limited
liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or
limited liability limited partnership shall provide the City with a surety bond
or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become
due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be
in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross purchases made by the
collector multiplied by the applicable tax rate.

corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,

responsibility for the filing of returns or the payment of tax, or who is under
a duty to act for the corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability partnership, or limited liability company in complying with any
requirement of this Chapter, and who is not jointly and severally liable under

penalties on those taxes, if the officer, member, manager, partner, or other
person willfully fails to pay or to cause to be paid any taxes due from the
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
or limited liability company pursuant to this part.
   (F)   The officer, member, manager, partner, or other person liable under §
6.44.160(E) shall be liable only for taxes that became due during the period he
or she had the control, supervision, responsibility, or duty to act for the
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
or limited liability company, plus interest and penalties on those taxes.
   (G)   Personal liability may be imposed pursuant to this section only if the
City can establish that the corporation, partnership, limited partnership,
limited liability partnership, or limited liability company had included tax
reimbursement in the selling price of, or added tax reimbursement to the
selling price of raw seafood product purchased in the conduct of its business,
or when it can be established that the corporation, partnership, limited
partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability company made a
sale of raw seafood product subject to tax and failed to pay the tax.
   (H)   For purposes of this section, "willfully fails to pay or to cause to
be paid" means that the failure was the result of an intentional, conscious,
and voluntary course of action.

businesses and any other information believed to be reliable or helpful to the
City in making an estimate of the hotel/motel tax due. Notice of the estimated
assessment of hotel-motel taxes due shall be furnished the seller by the City
via first-class mail to the last known address of the seller or via hand-
delivery to the seller and the estimated assessment shall become final for the
purposes of determining liability of the seller to the City after thirty (30)
days of the date of mailing or hand-delivery of the estimated assessment to the
seller unless the seller earlier files with the City an accurate tax return,

lesser a liability.

pledgee, purchaser or judgment lien creditor until notice of the lien is filed
in the office of the recorder for the recording district. The manner provided

distributor's interest is to be conveyed and shall include the name, address
and telephone number of the person or entity to whom the interest is to be
conveyed.
   (C)   Upon notice of sale and disclosure of buyer, the City shall be
authorized to disclose the status of the distributor's tobacco products tax
account to the named buyer or assignee.
   (D)   Upon receipt of notice of a sale or transfer, the City shall send the
transferee a copy of this code with this section highlighted.
   (E)   Neither the City's failure to give the notice nor the transferee's
failure to receive the notice shall relieve the transferee of any obligations
under this section.
   (F)   Following receipt of the notice, the City shall have 60 days in which
to perform a final tobacco products tax audit and assess tobacco products tax
liability against the seller of the business. If the notice is not mailed at
least ten business days before the sale is completed, the City shall have 12
months from the date of the completion of the sale or the City's knowledge of
the completion of the sale within which to begin a final tobacco products tax
audit and assess tobacco products tax liability against the seller of the
business. The City may also initiate an estimated assessment if the
requirements for such an assessment exist.
   (G)   A person acquiring any interest of a distributor in a business
required to remit the tax under this Chapter assumes the liability of the
distributor for all taxes due the City, whether current or delinquent, whether
known to the City or discovered later, and for all interest, penalties, costs
and charges on such taxes.
   (H)   Before the effective date of the transfer, the transferee of a
business shall obtain from the City an estimate of the delinquent tobacco
products tax, penalty and interest, if any, owed by the distributor as of the
date of the transfer, and shall withhold that amount from the consideration
payable for the transfer, until the distributor has produced a receipt from the
City showing that all tax obligations imposed by this Chapter have been paid. A
transferee that fails to withhold the amount required under this subsection
shall be liable to the City for the lesser of the amount of delinquent tobacco
products tax, penalty and interest due from the distributor as of the date of
transfer, and the amount that the transferee was required to withhold.
   (I)   In this section, the term "TRANSFER" includes the following:
      (1)   A change in voting control, or in more than 50% of the ownership
interest in a distributor that is a corporation, limited liability company or
partnership;
      (2)   A sale of all or substantially all the assets used in the business
of the distributor; or
      (3)   The initiation of a lease, management agreement or other
arrangement under which another person becomes entitled to the remote
distributor's or marketplace facilitator's gross receipts from sales, rentals
or services.
   (J)   A distributor who terminates the business without the benefit of a
purchaser, successor or assign shall make a final tax return and settlement of
tax obligations within 30 days after such termination. If a final return and
settlement are not received within 30 days of the termination, the distributor
shall pay a penalty of $500, plus an additional penalty of $25 for each
additional 30 day period, or part of such a period, during which the final
return and settlement have not been made, for a maximum of six additional
periods.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 3-30-21)
§ 6.56.130 PROCEDURES ON DELINQUENCIES.
   (A)   PENALTY. A penalty equal to 5% of the delinquent tax shall be added to
the tax for the first month, or any part thereof, and an additional 5% shall be
added to the tax due for each month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency until
a total penalty of 20% of the tobacco products tax due has accrued. The penalty
shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as the tax is assessed and
collected. The penalty does not bear interest.
   (B)   INTEREST. In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (A) above,
interest assessed on delinquent tax shall accrue at the rate of 15% per annum.
Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency until paid in full and shall
be collected in the same manner as the delinquent tax is collected.
   (C)   PRIORITY FOR CREDITING PAYMENTS. All payments received shall be
applied in the following order:
      (1)   Penalties due, beginning with the oldest penalty;
      (2)   Interest due, beginning with the interest due on the oldest month;
and
      (3)   Taxes due, beginning with the taxes due from the oldest month.
   (D)   WRITTEN DEMAND AND ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES. If a distributor fails to
file the return or make the remittance in accordance with §§
6.56.070 or
6.56.080, the City may do any or all of the following things:
      (1)   Cite the offender for a violation of this Chapter. Any person,
firm, or entity violating any provision of this Chapter is guilty of a minor
offense and shall be subject to a penalty as provided in §
1.24.040 or if no fine is there established, in an amount not to exceed $500
for each violation or day a violation exists. In all cases where a person is
found to have violated this Chapter, the court shall order the person to file
an accurate tobacco products tax return within 15 days, in addition to any fine
that may be imposed as a result of the violation. Prosecution under this
subsection does not limit the ability of the City to recover any amount of
unpaid taxes through civil action or as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (2)   File a civil complaint against the distributor for violation of any
obligation in this Chapter;
      (3)   Make a tobacco products tax assessment against the distributor,
with the assessment based upon an estimate of tax levied and owed by the
distributor during the period and institute civil action to recover the amount
of the tobacco products tax, interest, and penalty due and to request
injunctive relief. The estimate of tax may all be derived from past tobacco
products tax returns of the distributor or their predecessor, the general
economic level of the business community, information from tobacco products tax
audits conducted by the City, if available, returns of comparable businesses
and any other information believed to be reliable or helpful to the City in
making an estimate of the tobacco products tax due. Notice of the estimated
assessment of tobacco products taxes due shall be furnished the distributor by
the City via first-class mail to the last known address of the distributor or
via hand delivery to the distributor and the estimated assessment shall become
final for the purposes of determining liability of the distributor to the City
after 30 days of the date of mailing or hand-delivery of the estimated
assessment to the distributor unless the distributor earlier files with the
City an accurate tobacco products tax return, supported by satisfactory records
or documentation indicating a lesser liability;
      (4)   The tax, interest and penalty imposed under this Chapter shall
constitute a lien in favor of the City upon all the property of the distributor
whether tangible or intangible and wherever located. The lien arises upon
delinquency and continues until the liability is satisfied or the lien is
foreclosed. The lien is not valid as against a mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser or
judgment lien creditor until notice of the lien is filed in the office of the
recorder for the Aleutian Islands or Anchorage recording district. The manner
provided for Federal tax liens under AS 40.19.010 et seq. are by this reference
incorporated herein as if set forth in full.
   (E)   WAIVER. A penalty assessed under this section for the delinquent
remittance of tobacco products tax or failure to file a tobacco products tax
return may be waived by the City Manager, upon written application of the
distributor accompanied by a payment of all delinquent tobacco products tax,
interest and penalty otherwise owed by the distributor, within 45 calendar days
after the date of delinquency. A distributor may not be granted more than one
waiver of penalty under this subsection in any one calendar year. The City
Manager shall report such waivers of penalty to the City Council, in writing.

with the City if the distributor has defaulted on a repayment plan in the
previous two calendar years.
   (C)   The repayment plan shall include a secured promissory note that
substantially complies with the following terms:
      (1)   The distributor agrees to pay a minimum of 10% down payment on the
tax, interest and penalty amount due. The down payment shall be applied first
to penalty, then to accumulated interest, and then to the tax owed.
      (2)   The distributor agrees to pay the balance of the tax, penalty and
interest owed in monthly installments over a period not to exceed two years.
      (3)   Interest at a rate of 15% per annum shall accrue on the principal
sum due. Interest shall not apply to penalties owed or to interest accrued at
the time the repayment plan is executed or accruing during the term of the
repayment plan.
      (4)   If the distributor is a corporation or a limited liability entity,
the distributor agrees to provide a personal guarantee of the obligations under
the repayment plan.
      (5)   The distributor agrees to pay all future tax bills in accordance
with the provisions of this Chapter.
      (6)   The distributor agrees to provide a security interest in the form
of a tobacco products tax lien for the entire unpaid balance of the promissory
note to be recorded by the City at the time the repayment plan is signed. The
distributor shall be responsible for the cost of recording the tax lien.
   (D)   If a distributor fails to pay two or more payments as required by the
repayment plan agreement, the distributor shall be in default and the entire
amount owed at the time of default shall become immediately due. The City will
send the distributor a notice of default. The City may immediately foreclose on
the tobacco products tax lien or take any other remedy available under the law.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 3-30-21)
§ 6.56.150 PERIOD OF LIMITATION.
   (A)   The amount of any tobacco products tax imposed under this Chapter may
be determined and assessed at any time within a period of six years after the
tax became due and payable. The period shall begin on the date when a return is
required to be filed. Where no tobacco products tax return has been filed, or
where a fraudulent return has been filed, then the period of limitation does
not begin to run until discovery of the delinquency or fraud occurs. No
proceeding for the collection of the tobacco products tax shall be begun after
the expiration of this period.
   (B)   No obligation to remit tax established by section 6.56.030 shall be
applied retroactively.

made available for examination at reasonable times by the City or agents of the
City, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a return for the
purpose of determining the amount of tax levied.

§ 6.56.170 WITHHOLDING OF PERSONAL PROPERTY OF DISTRIBUTOR FAILING TO WITHHOLD.
   (A)   The City manager may by notice, served personally or by first-class
mail, require any employer, person, officer or department of the state,
political subdivision or agency of the state, having in their possession, or
under their control, any credits or other personal property or other things of
value, belonging to a distributor, to withhold, from the credits or other
personal property or other things of value, the amount of any tax, interest, or
penalties due from the distributor or the amount of any liability incurred by
that person for failure to withhold and transmit amounts due from a distributor
and to transmit the amount withheld to the City at the times that the City
manager may designate. However, in the case of a depository institution, as
defined in § 19(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C.A. § 461(b)(1)(A)),
amounts due from a distributor under this section shall be transmitted to the
City not less than ten business days from receipt of the notice. To be
effective, the notice shall state the amount due from the distributor and shall
be delivered or mailed to any branch or office where the City Manager
reasonably believes credits or other property is held.
   (B)   When the City, pursuant to this section, issues a levy upon, or
requires by notice, any person, or financial institution, as applicable, to
withhold all, or a portion of, a financial asset for the purpose of collecting
a delinquent tax liability, the person, or financial institution, that
maintains, administers, or manages that asset on behalf of the distributor, or
has the legal authority to accept instructions from the distributor as to the
disposition of that asset, shall liquidate the financial asset in a
commercially reasonable manner within 90 days of the issuance of the order to
withhold. Within five days of liquidation, the person, or financial
institution, as applicable, shall remit to the City the proceeds of the
liquidation, less any reasonable commissions or fees, or both, which are
charged in the normal course of business.
   (C)   If the value of the financial assets to be liquidated exceeds the tax
liability, the distributor may, within 60 days after the service of the order
to withhold upon the person, or financial institution, instruct the person, or
financial institution, as to which financial assets are to be sold to satisfy
the tax liability. If the distributor does not provide instructions for
liquidation, the person, financial institution, or securities intermediary
shall liquidate the financial assets in a commercially reasonable manner and in
an amount sufficient to cover the tax liability, and any reasonable commissions
or fees, or both, which are charged in the normal course of business, beginning
with the financial assets purchased most recently.
   (D)   Any corporation or person failing to withhold the amounts due from any
distributor and transmit them to the City after service of the notice shall be
liable for those amounts. However, in the case of a depository institution, if
a notice to withhold is mailed to the branch where the account is located or
principal banking office, the depository institution shall be liable for a
failure to withhold only to the extent that the accounts can be identified in
information normally maintained at that location in the ordinary course of
business.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 3-30-21)

   (B)   The City Manager or their designee shall take all steps necessary and
appropriate to administer this Chapter, which includes the authority to enter
into payment plans for delinquent tobacco products taxes, penalties and
interest.

shall be made. Any appraisals must be done within one year of the proposed
disposal.
   (B)   PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW. The parcels of land to be disposed of
shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission which shall make recommendations
to the City Manager concerning desirable uses of the property, including
projected need, if any, of the land for present or future recreational or other
public use. Such recommendation shall be by resolution after public hearing.

the Council, by resolution, may reduce the minimum acceptable offer to an

Council may reserve the right to reject any and all bids received if the
highest bid is below the appraised value and costs of sale or is not made by a

   Notwithstanding requirements of this title relating to terms, conditions,
procedures or other requirements for the sale, lease or other disposal of city

short description of the circumstances which prevent the Commissioner’s
physical attendance at the meeting.
      (3)   Telephone participation shall be refused by the Commission Chair
if, at any time, it appears that technical capabilities or other interference
does not allow all persons, whether physically present or not, to hear and

participating via telephone.
   (E)   Meetings.

is to be approved for that meeting or if it should be approved for a future
agenda. When at all possible, agenda items are to be submitted to the staff of
the Commission/Board in advance of a meeting so that the items can be duly
noted in the public notice.
   “Appearance Requests” mean that any person not a member of the Commission/
Board wishing to address the Commission/Board shall identify himself/herself
when called to do so by the chair and shall state his/her name, his/her place

      (3)   Any public hearing required to be held by the Commission/Board may
be conducted as an agenda item at a regular Commission/Board meeting. The
Commission/Board shall provide at least 10 days notice of such a public
hearing. Notice of the Public Hearing shall be given in the following manner:

hearing to all affected parties of record as defined by §
8.06.020(A)(3) and shown on the City of Unalaska Real Property Tax Roll.
         (b)   The Department of Planning will post at least two copies of this
notice, printed or written, in a conspicuous place not less than 10 days prior
to the date of the hearing.
      (4)   In computing any period of time prescribed by this title, the day
of the act or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is
not to be included. The last day of the period is to be included, unless it is
a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the
end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When the
period of time prescribed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays,
Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. A half
holiday shall be considered as other days and not as a holiday.
   When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder an act is required to be
allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the responsible authority,
for cause shown, may at any time in its discretion (1) with or without motion,
order the period enlarged if request therefore is made before the expiration of
the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order; or (2)
upon motion made after the expiration of the specified period, permit the act
to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.
   Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some
proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other
paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail, three days
shall be added to the prescribed time.
      (5)   The secretary shall post at least two copies of the proposed agenda
for each regular meeting of the Commission/Board in a conspicuous place.

      (7)   The meeting’s minutes, in written form, will be presented to the
Commission/ Board for review and approval. All meetings shall be audibly
recorded. Such recordings shall be kept for a period of one year. Where audible
recordings and written form are disputed, signed and approved written minutes
shall take precedence over audible recordings.
      (8)   A majority of the voting members of the Commission/Board shall be a
quorum for the transaction of business.
      (9)   Special meetings of the Commission/Board, including public hearings
or work sessions where public notification provisions have been met, may be
held at the call of the chair or secretary upon twenty-four hours’ advance
notice given to fellow Commission/Board members. Only those items of business
set forth in the notice of the special meeting shall be in order.
      (10)   All meetings of the Commission/Board shall be adjourned no later
than 10:00 p.m., except that the Commission/ Board may by vote extend a meeting
to 11:00 p.m. There shall be no business or action taken after 11:00 p.m., but
the Commission/Board may continue a meeting to another day.
      (11)   The Commission/Board may, after convening as a public meeting,
upon a majority vote of the body, determine to meet in an executive session.
The motion calling for the executive session must clearly and with specificity
describe the subject of the proposed executive session without defeating the
purpose of addressing the subject in private, and no other matters may be
considered at the executive session. No official action may be taken at an
executive session.
   (F)   Voting.
      (1)   Each member of the Commission/Board shall vote on each substantive
question except as provided herein.
      (2)   A member of the Commission/Board may request upon the opening of a
public hearing that he/she or any other member of the Commission/Board be
excused or disqualified from voting. Upon such request, the chair shall ask for
objections to the request, or if necessary, the members shall vote upon the
excusal or disqualification.
      (3)   A member of the Commission/Board shall not vote on any question on
which he/she has a conflict of interest pursuant to §§
2.60.110 and
2.64.020(C) UCO. If a member is disqualified or excused from voting on a matter
before the Commission/Board, the member may represent his/her own interests
before the Commission/Board. If a member is disqualified or excused from voting
on a matter before the Commission/Board, the member shall physically move from
his/her seat as a Commission/Board member into the area where the public is
seated.
      (4)   No member of the Commission/Board shall represent another person
before the Commission/Board. This subsection does not prevent an ex-officio
member of the Commission/Board from representing the city before the
Commission/Board. A member may represent his/her employer after declaring a
conflict exists and stepping down.
   (G)   Parliamentary authority. The rules contained in the current edition of
Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised shall govern the Commission/Board in all
situations in which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent
with these Planning Commission/Platting Board standards noted elsewhere in this
section.
   (H)   Reconsideration.
      (1)   A motion for reconsideration allows a member to bring back for a
quorum’s further consideration a motion which has already been voted on. The
purpose of reconsidering a vote is to permit correction of a hastily, ill-
advised, or erroneous action, or to take into account added information, or a
changed situation that has developed since the taking of the vote. The reasons
to reconsider must be stated in the motion of reconsideration and must be
seconded.
      (2)   A motion for reconsideration may be made only by a member who voted
on the prevailing side. When a member who cannot move for reconsideration
believes there are valid reasons for reconsideration, he/she should, time and
opportunity permitting, try to persuade a member who voted on the prevailing
side to make such a motion. A second for reconsideration may be made by any
member of the Commission/Board.
      (3)   The making of a motion for reconsideration and its second is
subject to the time limit of 24 hours from the adjournment of the meeting at
which the motion was originally considered.
      (4)   A motion and a second for reconsideration made after adjournment of
the meeting at which the original motion was made must be in writing to the
secretary of the Commission/Board and must list the reasons for such a motion.
      (5)   A motion for reconsideration must be heard no later than the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission/Board.
   (I)   Ratification. These rules, and any subsequent amendments thereto,
shall become effective after they are adopted by resolution of the Commission/
Board and approved by the City Council.

be removed from office for just cause and on written charges by a two-thirds
vote of the City Council, but such member shall be entitled to a public hearing
before a vote is taken. In addition, a member may be removed for non-attendance

member without action by the City Council, according to the rules adopted by

reason, the Commission/Board shall by resolution declare the seat vacant.

notify the Mayor promptly of any vacancies occurring in membership. The Mayor
shall appoint to fill a vacancy, and the City Council shall vote to approve an

appointment for the unexpired term of the original appointment. A new
appointment, as prescribed in §
8.04.020, shall be for three years.

economy in the process of development. The Comprehensive Plan shall be a

health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. This chapter
is designed to encourage the orderly development and use of land; to prevent
overcrowding; to prevent congestion on streets and highways; to provide
adequate light and air; and to protect the public from fire, disease, and other
dangers. This chapter is designed to achieve the greatest economy to the city
and its citizens while protecting the public interests involved in the
subdivision of land within the city.
   (B)   Authority. This chapter has been adopted pursuant to AS 29.40.
   (C)   Scope. This chapter shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part
of a subdivision legally created and filed for approval or record prior to the
effective date of this chapter. Notwithstanding other provisions of this
chapter, the development or creation of plats or subdivisions is subject to §
8.08.070, “Platting Procedures”; §
8.08.090, “Subdivision Design Standards”; and §
8.08.100, “Subdivision Improvements.” Where this chapter imposes a greater
restriction upon land than is imposed or required by existing provision of
other laws or regulations, or with private restrictions placed upon the
property by deed, restrictive covenants, or other private agreements running
with the land, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (D)   Jurisdiction. This chapter governs all subdivision of land, tide and
submerged lands, and platting within the City of Unalaska city limits.
   (E)   Requirement to plat. All subdivision of land within the jurisdiction
of the city shall be by plat in compliance with this chapter. Subdivision by
development of a lease lot or lease parcel may occur following the approval of
a preliminary plat provided that the land owner shall proceed to the final plat
within one year.
   (F)   Administration. The approval provision of this chapter shall be
administered by the Director of Planning and the Platting Board (“Board”) in
accordance with AS 29.40.080.
   (G)   Public notice requirements. The Platting Authority shall hold at least
one public hearing on an alteration or replat petition which shall not be more
than sixty days after the application is filed. The Department of Planning will
mail a copy of the public notice to each affected property owner (as shown on
the most recent copy of the City of Unalaska Real Property Tax Roll) within the
area being altered or replatted. The notice shall generally describe the
alteration or replat requested. The Department of Planning will post at least
two copies of the notice, printed or written, in a conspicuous place not less
than 10 days prior to the date of the hearing.
   (H)   Computation of prescribed time periods. In computing any period of
time prescribed by this chapter, the day of the act or default from which the
designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of
the period is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
holiday. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven days,
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the
computation. A half holiday shall be considered as other days and not as a
holiday.
   When by these rules or by notice given thereunder an act is required to be
done at or within a specified time, the responsible authority, for cause shown,
may at any time in its discretion (1) with or without motion, order the period
enlarged if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period
originally prescribed or as extended by previous order; or (2) upon motion made
after the expiration of the specified period, permit the act to be done where
the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.
   Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some
proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other

§ 8.08.080 TITLE TO VACATED AREA.
   (A)   The title to a right-of-way or other public area vacated on a plat
attaches to the lot or lands bordering on the area in equal proportions, except
that if the area vacated was originally dedicated by different persons,
original boundary lines shall be adhered to so that the area that lies on one
side of the boundary line shall attach to the abutting property on that side
and the area that lies on the other side of the boundary line shall attach to
the property on that side. The portion of a vacated area that lies within the
limits of a platted addition attaches to the lots of the platted addition
bordering on the area. If a public square is vacated, the title to it vests in
the city if it lies within the city. If the property vacated is a lot or tract,
title vests in the rightful owner.
   (B)   If the city acquired the right-of-way or other public area vacated for
legal consideration or by express dedication to and acceptance by the city
other than as a subdivision platting requirement, before the final act of
vacation the fair market value of the area shall be deposited with the city.

centers, and the access to arterial streets. Collector streets shall have a
minimum fifty-foot width with a minimum travel surface of forty feet unless
otherwise specified by the Platting Authority;
         (c)   Minor streets, including cul-de-sacs, shall be laid out to
conform as much as possible to topography, to discourage use by through-
traffic, to provide the minimum amount of street necessary to provide
convenient, safe access to residential lots, and to provide an efficient route
for utility systems. Minor streets shall have a minimum forty-foot width with a
minimum travel surface of twenty-four to thirty-six feet unless otherwise
specified by the Platting Authority;
         (d)   Alleys should be used only in commercial areas for delivery and
services. Alleys may be used in residential areas when approved by the Board.
Alleys shall have a twenty-foot width with a travel surface of sixteen to
twenty feet unless otherwise specified by the Platting Authority.
         (e)   Cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum rights-of-way width of 40 feet,
leading to a cul-de-sac turn-around with a minimum radius of 50 feet.
      (3)   Half-streets. Where a street is adjacent to a subdivision, the
other half of that street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. No half streets
within new subdivisions shall be allowed, unless specifically approved by the
Board.
      (4)   Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks not less than fifteen-feet wide
may be required by the Board where deemed necessary to provide for pedestrian
access to schools, shopping centers, and playgrounds, or other community
facilities.
      (5)   Street names. See
Chapter 15.08 “Street Names.”
   (C)   Blocks. The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the topography, locality, and type of development.
   (D)   Lots.
      (1)   General. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use contemplated.
      (2)   Dimensions.
         (a)   Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of
Chapter 8.12, “Zoning,” provided that no lot shall be less than 10,000 square
feet in area. If requirements identified in §
8.08.070(A)(3)(d) have been addressed, residential lots less than 10,000 square
feet but greater than 6,000 square feet may be permitted. See
Chapter 8.12 for lot size requirements in different districts.
         (b)   Lots shall be designed with a suitable proportion between width
and depth. Long and narrow, or wide and shallow lots are undesirable. Normal
depth shall not exceed 2 1/2 times width, or be less than 85 feet. Width of all
lots shall not be less than 60 feet. See
Chapter 8.12, “Zoning,” for lot dimension requirements in different districts.
         (c)   Lots laid out for commercial or industrial purposes shall be
adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required
by the type of development.
         (d)   No lots, tracts, or parcels shall be created or designed which
would create any non-conforming setbacks as they relate to any physical
improvements which are subject to setback, building separation, or other
dimensional provisions.
      (3)   Corner lots. Corner lots should be large enough to allow full
setback of buildings from both streets as required.
      (4)   Access. Every lot shall front or abut on a publicly dedicated
street.
      (5)   Lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be substantially at right
angles or radial to the side of the streets.
      (6)   Lot remnants. All remnants of lots left over after subdividing of a
large tract must be added to adjacent lots or right-of-way rather than be
allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
      (7)   Buffer zones and greenbelts. Buffer zones and/or greenbelts may be
required by the Platting Authority.

§ 8.08.100 SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Provision of improvements.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish and define the
improvements which will be required under a subdivision agreement developed by
the subdivider and public officials and agencies concerned with the
administering, planning, designing, constructing, and financing of public
facilities and to establish procedures for assuring compliance with these
requirements.
      (2)   Responsibility. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to
have prepared by a registered engineer a complete set of construction plans,
including profiles, cross-sections, specifications, and other supporting data
for the required public street, utilities, and other facilities. Such
construction plans shall be based on data contained in the approved preliminary
plat.
      (3)   Relief to required improvements. If the subdivider/developer or its
agent seek to avoid any requirements of this section, relief to the specific
requirements shall be sought from the Platting Authority. Such requests will be
in writing and shall state the reasons for the request. The request will be
reviewed by the applicable city departments. Consultation with appropriate
departments is advised. Granting of such relief shall be by resolution of the
Platting Board. Relief from utility service line connections shall only be
approved if all of the following are true:
         (a)   The plat subdivides a single lot into no more than four lots;
and
         (b)   The plat provides direct, physical, realistic access to the
right-of-way for each lot in the subdivision. Such access shall not rely on an
easement, but rather shall rely on the lots being physically adjacent to the
right-of-way; and
         (c)   The plat does not contain any dedication of right-of-way,
street, or other public area, except utility easements; and
         (d)   The requirements of §
8.08.040(C)(1) through §
8.08.040(C)(3) are met by the subdivider/developer or its agent.
   (B)   Required improvements. Prior to being granted approval for the final
plat, the subdivider shall have installed, or shall have furnished an adequate
guarantee for the ultimate installation of the following improvements:
      (1)   Streets. All streets shall be constructed and provided in
accordance with applicable standard specifications of the city (See City of
Unalaska Standard Specifications for Construction of Streets.) The Platting
Authority may waive this requirement.
      (2)   Water supply.
         (a)   Where the community water system is available within 300 feet of
the proposed subdivision, each lot within the subdivision shall be provided
with a connection thereto.
         (b)   Where a community water system is not available, the subdivider
shall provide wells or a water-supply system for each lot in accordance with
the requirements of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
         (c)   Fire hydrants shall be installed and approved by the Department
of Public Utilities in all subdivisions with a community water system.
      (3)   Sanitary sewage system.
         (a)   Where community sewerage facilities are available within 300
feet of the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall supply both collectors
and laterals and provide for each lot the connection to the community system.
         (b)   Where a community sewerage system does not exist, the subdivider
shall provide either individual or collective sewerage facilities for each lot
in accordance with the requirements of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation. On large lot subdivisions of an acre or more, this requirement
may be waived by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
      (4)   Electric service. Where community electric facilities are available
within 300 feet of the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall provide for
each lot a connection to the community system.
      (5)   Oversize utility systems. The Board, in consultation with the
Department of Public Utilities, may require the subdivider to install oversize
utility systems in order to accommodate probable and desirable growth in the
immediate area. When such oversize systems are required, the subdivider shall
be reimbursed by the city for the excess costs of providing standard utility
lines.
      (6)   Easements. The subdivider will be required to consult with the
Department of Public Utilities for location of easements as they relate to
existing or proposed public utilities. In instances where the city determines
that providing electric, water or wastewater utility service requires the
location of electric, water or wastewater equipment and/or main lines on the
lots located within the subdivision, the subdivider/developer shall be required
to grant a utility easement at no charge to the city, appropriate in size,
nature and location to accommodate the installation and on-going maintenance of
the equipment and/or main lines needed to serve the subdivision. The equipment
and/or main lines may be used to serve the properties of other utility
customers if the service does not change the size, nature or location of the
equipment and/or main lines, or otherwise create an additional burden upon the
property within the subdivision.
         (a)   Utility easements along rear or side lines of all lots may be
required, although utilities will be placed in public right-of-ways whenever
possible.
      (7)   Drainage. The subdivider shall consult with the Department of
Public Works for location of easements as they relate to existing or proposed
drainage. In instances where the city determines that an area requires the
location of drainage equipment on the lots located within the subdivision, the
subdivider/developer shall be required to grant a drainage easement at no
charge to the city, appropriate in size, nature and location to accommodate the
installation and on-going maintenance of the equipment needed to provide
adequate drainage for the subdivision. The subdivider may be responsible for a
total surface drainage plan showing all drainage facilities and slopes.
Drainage easements will be provided whenever the subdivision is traversed by a
water course, drainage way, channel, or stream conforming to the course of that
feature and wide enough to provide access for maintenance and improvement.
Consultation with the Department of Public Works is advised.
   (C)   Extent of improvements. All the required improvements shall be
installed to the boundaries of the subdivision and shall be designed to provide
for future extension to and service of contiguous areas.
   (D)   Dedication. All streets, facilities, and improvements shall be
expressly dedicated to public use and maintenance at the time of the approval
of the final plat. Those dedicated shall be constructed at acceptable city
standards prior to acceptance by the city.
   (E)   Guarantee of required improvements. Before considering the final plat
where improvements are required by the Platting Authority, a “Planning
Determination” must be made that all improvements required by the Platting
Authority have been constructed. If the required improvements have not been
completed, the subdivider shall be required to include with the final plat a
surety bond or certified check in an amount equal to the cost of construction
of those improvements as estimated by the city. The guarantee will be subject
to the conditions that the improvements will be completed within 24 months
after approval of the final plat. If completed, the city will return the full
amount of the guarantee to the subdivider. If not completed, the city shall
complete construction of the improvements with the guarantee. Any amount of the
guarantee in excess of the costs of completing the requirement improvements
will be returned to the subdivider. However, the subdivider cannot be charged
for any amount in excess of the original guarantee.
   (F)   Maintenance agreement. The subdivider shall guarantee that the
required improvements provided will remain in good condition for a period of
one year after the date of conditional acceptance by the city and shall agree
to make all repairs to and maintain said improvements in good condition during
the one-year period at no cost to the city. The subdivider may be required by
the Board to include with the final plat a surety bond or certified check in an
amount equal to five percent of the cost of improvements, for payment of costs
for any correction, reconstruction, repair, or maintenance of the improvements
during the one-year warranty period. Any amount of the maintenance guarantee in
excess of the costs of correction, reconstruction, repair, or maintenance will
be returned to the subdivider.

§ 8.08.110 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. The Board may grant a variance from the provisions of this
chapter on a finding that undue hardship may result from strict compliance with
specific provisions or requirements of this chapter. The Board shall only grant
variances that it deems necessary because of an undue hardship or that it finds
desirable from the standpoint of public interest. In making its findings, as
required below, the Board shall take into account the nature of the proposed
use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the
proposed subdivision, and the probable effects of the proposed subdivision upon
conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the Board finds
that:
      (1)   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the
proposed subdivision such that strict application of the provisions of this
chapter would clearly be impractical or undesirable to the general public or
that strict application would be unreasonable or cause undue hardship to the
applicant requesting the variance. In such cases, the subdivider shall first
state his/her reasons in writing for a variance from the specific provision or
requirement involved and submit the statement to the Board;
      (2)   The granting of a specified variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the proposed
subdivision is located;
      (3)   Such variance will be in accord with the intent and purpose of this
chapter and of the Comprehensive Plan of the city; and
      (4)   The Board shall note its findings and the specific reasons for its
action on the request for a variance, and shall also record its action in the
form of a resolution.
   (B)   Public improvements relief. The Board may grant relief from the
provisions requiring the installation of any required public improvements
where, in its best judgment, such installation shall be impractical or
undesirable to the general public or when other circumstances warrant relief.
Application for any relief shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at
the time the preliminary plat is submitted to the Board. The application shall
state fully the reasons for requesting relief (See §
8.08.100(A)(3)).
   (C)   Planned unit developments. The subdivider may request a variance from
the specified portions of this chapter in the case of a planned unit
development. Application for any such variance shall be made in writing by the
subdivider at the time the preliminary plat is submitted to the Board. The
application for variance shall be supplemented with maps, plans, or other data
which may aid the Board in the analysis of the proposed project.

§ 8.08.120 PENALTIES.
   (A)   The owner or agent of the owner of land within a subdivision who
transfers, sells, or enters into a contract to sell land in a subdivision
before a plat of the subdivision has been prepared, approved, and recorded, as
required by this chapter, is guilty of a minor offense, and upon conviction is
punishable by a fine of $1,000. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist
shall constitute a separate offense for purposes of this subsection.
   (B)   Any person who fraudulently alters a plat approved by the Platting
Authority and records or seeks to have recorded such a plat not approved by the
Platting Authority is guilty of a minor offense and shall be fined in an amount
of $1,000. The Director of Planning shall take appropriate legal action to void
and nullify any such plat.

§ 8.08.130 APPEALS; ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
   (A)   Appeals. A person aggrieved by the decision of the Platting Board may
make written request for a hearing before the City Council to appeal such
decision. For purposes of this subsection, an aggrieved person means the
applicant or a landowner within the boundaries of the area proposed to be
platted, altered, or replatted. Such request shall contain reference to the
specific decision appealed and shall be delivered to the City Clerk within ten
working days from the decision. Upon receipt of any such request, the City
Council will set a date for a public hearing to consider the Platting Board's
decision and objections thereto. The City Council may at its hearing receive
such further evidence as is relevant. At the public hearing, the City Council
shall have the power to overrule, alter, or maintain the ruling of the Platting
Board. The decision of the City Council is final and may be appealed to the
Superior Court.
      (1)   With respect to abbreviated plats (§
8.08.040) and right-of-way acquisition plats (§
8.08.050), all decisions of the Director of Planning as the Platting Authority
shall be final unless appealed to the Board within ten working days after the
date of the decision. An appeal under this subsection shall be treated as a
preliminary platting application. The decision of the Board is appealable as
discussed above.
   (B)   Appeals from administrative decisions. Administrative decisions shall
be in writing. Appeals shall be taken to the Platting Board by any affected
landowner within the affected area proposed to be platted, altered, or
replatted, which is affected by any order, requirement, permit, or decision
made by the Director of Planning or any administrative official in the
administration of, or the enforcement of this chapter. Such appeals shall be
filed in writing, with the Director of Planning within 10 working days of the
date of the action being appealed. Upon receipt of such an appeal, the Director
of Planning shall set the time and place at which the matter will be
considered. At least 10 days' notice of such time and place shall be given to
the adverse parties of record of such time and to the official whose decision
is being appealed. The officer from whom the appeal is being taken shall
transmit to the Platting Board all records and proceedings pertaining to the
decision being appealed, together with such additional written reports as are
deemed necessary. In exercising the power granted therein, the Platting Board
may, in conformity with this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or
modify the order or decision appealed from, and may make such order, as should
be made. The Platting Board in making its decision may hear any pertinent
facts. A person aggrieved by a decision of the Platting Board may appeal that
decision pursuant to
8.08.130(A).
   (C)   A citation for a minor offense is governed by Alaska law and the Rules
of Minor Offense Procedure and is not subject to appeal under this section.

§ 8.12.010 ESTABLISHMENT OF A ZONING ORDINANCE.
   (A)   This chapter shall be known as the “Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Unalaska.”
   (B)   This chapter is adopted for the purposes of promoting the health,
safety, and general welfare of the people of the city and achieving the
following objectives:
      (1)   Implementing the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   Providing for orderly growth and development of the city;
      (3)   Establishing zoning districts within which the needs of
residential, commercial, industrial, and all other uses can be appropriately
met;
      (4)   Providing minimum standards within zoning districts for the uses of
land, location and height of buildings, building density, and off-street
parking;
      (5)   Facilitating adequate provisions for services and facilities such
as water, sewerage, schools, parks, transportation, utilities, and other public
requirements; and
      (6)   Reducing the effects of incompatible land uses.
   (C)   All new buildings, structures, or lots shall hereafter be used in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   It is the intent of this chapter that all lands and platted tide and
submerged lands situated within the city limits shall be classified into one of
the zoning districts contained herein. The boundaries of each zoning district
shall be shown on the City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway
Map. The City Council, the Planning Commission, the Department of Planning,
and/or landowners within the city limits may petition to change the zoning of
an area if the procedures prescribed in this chapter are followed.
   (E)   It is also the intent of this chapter that all Native Allotments (see
§
8.06.020(A)(79)) and Restricted Deed Lots (See §
8.06.020(A)(108)) are to be exempt from the provisions of Title 8, UCO of the
City of Unalaska until such time as full unrestricted title to such properties
is granted by the federal government. Immediately upon the granting of full and
unrestricted title to such properties by the federal government, such
properties are deemed to be classified “Holding District” and are subject to
the provisions of Title 8, UCO of the City of Unalaska.
   (F)   Upon recommendation of the Commission or on its own motion, the City
Council may establish a schedule of fees for the filing of variance,
conditional use, or zone amendment applications with the Commission. Until all
application fees, charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall
be taken on any application.

§ 8.12.020 CITY OF UNALASKA OFFICIAL ZONING, STREETS, AND HIGHWAY MAP.
   (A)   There shall be maintained in the office of the Department of Planning,
a City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway Map of the city
showing the classifications of all land for use according to this chapter. The
City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway Map shall be available
to the public for inspection. Section
8.12.030 establishes the zoning districts for the city.
   (B)   When the City Council changes the City of Unalaska Official Zoning,
Streets, and Highway Map as provided procedurally in §
8.12.190, the Department of Planning shall be responsible for amending the City
of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway Map to indicate changes and
date of changes.
   (C)   Zone boundaries on the City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and
Highway Map are governed by the following provisions:
      (1)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the right-of-way
lines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such lines;
      (2)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines;
      (3)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall
be construed as following such city limits;
      (4)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, or other bodies of
water shall be construed to follow such centerlines;
      (5)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extension of features
indicated in subsections (1) through (4) shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated shall be determined by the scale of the City of Unalaska
Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway Map;
      (6)   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and
Highway Map, the Director of Planning shall interpret the district boundaries.
This determination shall be known as a “Planning Determination” subject to §
8.12.220(A)(2); and
      (7)   At the time of passage of this chapter, where a district boundary
line divides a lot, the Planning Commission may permit, after review and with
conditions, the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot
beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot with the intent
to make both lots conforming if possible.
   (D)   In the event that the City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and
Highway Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret due to
the nature of number of changes and additions, the City Council, upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission, may adopt a new City of Unalaska
Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway Map. The new City of Unalaska Official
Zoning, Streets, and Highway Map may correct drafting or other errors or
omissions in the prior map, but no such correction shall have the effect of
amending the original City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway
Map or any subsequent amendment thereof unless so specified by the City
Council. The prior City of Unalaska Official Zoning, Streets, and Highway Map,
and any significant parts thereof shall be preserved, together with all
available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.

occupied, and no building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be
erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in
conformity with all of the regulations specified in this chapter for the
district in which it is located;
      (2)   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or
altered to exceed the height or bulk, to accommodate or house a greater number
of families, to occupy a greater percentage of lot area, or to have narrower or
smaller rear yards, or to have open spaces other than required by this chapter,
or in any other manner to be contrary to the provisions of this chapter; and
      (3)   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance
shall be reduced in dimension of area below the minimum requirements set forth
herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this ordinance shall
meet the minimum requirements established by this ordinance.

§ 8.12.040 SINGLE-FAMILY/DUPLEX DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The Single-Family/Duplex District is intended to
stabilize and protect the one- and two-family dwelling residential character of
the district and to promote and encourage a safe and suitable environment for
family life. It is also intended that all development in this district be
served with public sewer and water. Should instances arise where such uses are
proposed for lots not served by public water and sewer, the approval of the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation will be required.
   (B)   Uses permitted. In the Single-Family/Duplex District, no building or
structure or land shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected
which is arranged, intended, or designated to be used for other than one or
more of the following uses:
      (1)   Up to two single-family dwellings or a two-family dwelling, on a
lot;
      (2)   Home occupations subject to the requirements of §
8.12.180(M);
      (3)   Day-care for five or less children;

§ 8.12.150 HOLDING DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The Holding District is intended to provide a
temporary zoning designation for those lands within the City of Unalaska that
are suitable and intended for future development but for which the landowner
has no proposed land use plans. The Holding District is not intended to
prohibit future development, but to provide both the city and the landowner
flexibility in determining the future zoning district for those lands initially
designated as Holding District. When land uses other than those listed
immediately below under (B) “Uses Permitted” are desired by any landowner in
the Holding District, said owner will be required to obtain a zoning amendment
reclassifying the property within the Holding District the landowner intends to
develop to a zoning district that permits the desired use. No other zoning
district may be rezoned to a Holding District.
   (B)   Uses permitted. In the Holding District no building or structure or
land shall be used or erected for other than the following activities until a
zoning district change has been obtained for the land:
      (1)   Traditional personal use subsistence resource gathering activities
including fishing, hunting, shellfish gathering, and the gathering of plant
species;
      (2)   Temporary and casual recreation uses, defined as hiking, camping,
picnicking, skiing, snowshoeing and sport fishing;
      (3)   Noncommercial fishing camps;
      (4)   Other similar uses not listed above which meet the “Purpose and
Intent” provisions of this section of the ordinance and would be no more
objectionable than those uses listed above. The Director of Planning shall make
a “Planning Determination” in this matter subject to appeal to the Planning
Commission (See §
8.12.220(A)(2)).
   (C)   Conditional uses and structures. In the Holding District no
conditional uses will be allowed to be applied for or be permitted. Any desired
use by a landowner will require a zone amendment which permits the desired use
outright.
(Ord. No. 2001-04, passed 5-8-01; Am. Ord. 2005-09, passed 4-26-05)
§ 8.12.160 COMMUNICATION AND UTILITY TOWERS OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The Communication and Utility Towers Overlay
District (“CUTOD”) is intended to provide for the development of communication
towers and public utility towers that will enhance the safety and welfare of
the community. The underlying zoning district provisions regarding maximum
height of structures shall not apply to the permitted uses within the CUTOD set
forth in subsection (B) below. All other underlying zoning district provisions
are neither abandoned nor repealed, but are augmented by the Communication and
Utility Towers Overlay District requirements. Property shall not be eligible
for inclusion in the Communication and Utility Towers Overlay District unless:
      (1)   The underlying zoning district is Marine-Related/Industrial,
Marine- Dependent/Industrial, Public/Quasi-Public or Holding District; and
      (2) The property is more than 500 feet from a residential district; or
      (3)   The property is more than 100 feet and less than 500 feet from a
residential district and the Planning Commission has adopted a resolution,
subject to appeal to the City Council pursuant to Section
8.12.210(C), finding that inclusion of the property in the CUTOD is appropriate
given the additional limitations on the separation of permitted uses from
existing residential structures required by Section
8.12.160(D)(5).
   (B)   Uses permitted. In the CUTOD no building or structure or land shall be
used or erected for other than the following activities:
      (1)   Communication, radio and television antenna/towers and equipment;
      (2)   Utility generation, or distribution towers and equipment;
      (3)   Other similar uses not listed above which meet the “Purpose and
intent” provisions of this section and would be no more objectionable than
those uses listed above. The Director of Planning shall make a “Planning
Determination” in this matter subject to appeal to the Planning Commission (See
§
8.12.220(A)(2)).
   (C)   Lot size. The minimum lot size shall be 500 square feet or as
specified in the underlying zoning district whichever is greater.
   (D)   Minimum setback requirements. The minimum setback requirements shall
be as specified in the underlying zoning district. If no setback requirements
are specified in the underlying zoning district setback requirements are as
follows:
      (1)   Front. No setback distance is required, except when the property
abuts a right- of-way there shall be a 10-foot setback; where the property
adjoins a water body there shall be 50 foot setback.
      (2)   Side. No setback distance is required, except when the property
abuts a right- of-way there shall be a 10-foot setback; where the property
adjoins a water body there shall be 50 foot setback.
      (3)   Rear. No setback distance is required, except when the property
abuts a right- of-way there shall be a 10-foot setback; where the property
adjoins a water body there shall be 50 foot setback
   If there exists questions as to the applicability of the above setback
provisions, the Director of Planning shall make a “Planning Determination” in
this matter subject to appeal to the Planning Commission (See §
8.12.220(A)(2)).
   (E)   Special provisions. The following special provisions apply to all uses
within the CUTOD:
      (1)   All uses will comply with federal, state, and local air, water
quality, and waste disposal laws and other environmental regulations;
      (2)   Any use is prohibited which causes or may reasonably be expected to
cause excessive noise, vibration, odor, smoke, dust, or other particulate
matter, humidity, heat, or glare at or beyond any lot line of the lot on which
it is located. “Excessive” is defined for these purposes as a degree exceeding
that generated by uses permitted in the district in their customary manner of
operation, or to a degree injurious to the public health, safety, welfare, or
convenience;
      (3)   The storage of flammable materials, hazardous materials, or toxic
waste on-site shall be allowed only in strict compliance with federal, state,
and local laws and regulations; and
      (4)   Materials shall be stored and grounds shall be maintained in a
manner which will not attract or aid the propagation of insects or rodents or
otherwise create a health hazard.
      (5)   Any antennae or tower shall be separated from any residential
structure by at least 200% of the antennae or tower height.
   (F)   Parking regulations (§
8.12.170(K)).

further restrict, where applicable, the provisions for all zoning districts set
forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Front yards (See §
8.06.020(A), “Yard”). Where any specified front yard is required, no building
shall be hereafter erected or altered so that any portion thereof shall be
nearer to the front lot line than the distance indicated by the depth of the
required front yard. Exceptions include:

not being over 30 inches high may be built within a side yard a distance of not
more than two feet and are specifically excluded from this definition; and
      (2)   Eaves, cornices, and similar ornamentations may project over a side
yard not more than two feet.
   (D)   Rear yards (See §
8.06.020(A), “Yard”). Where any specified rear yard is required, no building
shall be hereafter erected or altered so that any portion thereof shall be

yard not more than two feet.
   (E)   Irregular lot shapes. Where irregular lot shapes prevent the direct
determination of the area and yard requirements for a lot, the Director of
Planning shall determine said area and yard requirements. Said determination
shall be known as a “Planning Determination” and the Planning Commission will
be advised of said determination at its next regular meeting (See §
8.12.220(A)(2)).
   (F)   Lease lots, lease parcels. Parcels or land defined by lease lines
shall be subject to provisions of Title 8 UCO as if they were actual lots.

limited to, zoning land use restrictions, setbacks, yards, and other
dimensional requirements.
   (G)   Height requirements.  
      (1)   Height limitations shall not apply to projections such as chimneys,
domes, spires, towers, antennae, aerials, flagpoles, and other similar objects
not used for human occupancy. Separation distance requirements and applicable
zoning district requirements for specific projections still apply to all
objects exempted from height requirements under this section.
      (2)   For all lands contiguous to or adjoining the Unalaska/Dutch Harbor
Airport, no structures or equipment may be located in such a manner that any
portion of a structure or piece of equipment projects into the runway clear
zone or approach surfaces (For detailed required standards in this matter
contact the FAA).
   (H)   Fences. Fences and walls may be erected to a six-foot height maximum
anywhere on the lot in any residential or open-space district and to a ten-foot
height maximum anywhere on a lot in any other zoning district.
   (I)   Vision clearance. On a corner lot, there shall be no obstruction to
vision above three feet within ten feet of any street intersection. This vision
clearance requirement will also apply to off-street parking of vehicles.
   (J)   Accessory building, structure or use. A building, structure or use
which is considered incidental to the operation or enjoyment of a lawful
permitted use or conditional use, and is appropriate, and subordinate to any
such building, structure or use, shall be considered accessory when located on
the same lot. The overall height shall not exceed that allowed in the specific
zone of location.
   (K)   Off-street parking requirements. At the time a new structure is
erected or a structure is enlarged, or the use of the existing structure is
changed, off-street parking spaces shall be provided as set forth in this
section, unless greater requirements are otherwise provided in connection with
an existing use prior to the adoption date of this chapter. Each parking space
shall be at least 180 square feet in area and have a width of nine feet and a
depth of not less than 20 feet. In determining the gross area required for an
off-street parking lot requiring a specific number of parking places including
driveways and aisles, 250 square feet per parking space shall be used. Each use
shall provide the following minimum off-street parking spaces discussed below.
      (1)   Mixed occupancy. In the case of two or more uses on a lot, the
total requirements for parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for
the several uses computed separately.

      (3)   Off-site parking requirements. An off-site lot must be owned or
leased by the applicant. Written evidence of ownership or a long-term lease
agreement must be presented to the Director of Planning. Upon expiration of the
lease, the applicant shall be responsible for the continued provision of the
required number of parking spaces.
      (4)   Shared parking. The Director of Planning may authorize a reduction
in the number of required off-street parking spaces through the shared or joint
use of the same parking area by two or more uses or structures within any
zoning district except residential districts. The applicants for shared parking
shall present the Director of Planning with their written reasons for providing
for the shared or joint use of off-street parking facilities. The common
parking area shall be located within the distances specified in (2)(b) above.
      (5)   Handicapped accessible parking. All land uses that require off-
street parking spaces under this title, except residential dwelling units,
shall be required to provide additional off-street parking spaces for
handicapped motorists. Such parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with
the following requirements in addition to the other off-street parking
requirements:

Determination (See §
8.12.220(A)(2)).
      (7)   Off-street loading spaces (See §
8.06.020(A), “Loading Space, Off-Street”). In addition to the parking
requirements noted above, and depending on the proposed uses, off- street
loading spaces may be desired. When designing off-street loading spaces, care
shall be taken so that loading vehicles do not encroach upon public right-of-
ways. Consideration shall be given in designing these spaces so that when a
loading vehicle is positioning to use a loading space, a right-of-way shall not
be blocked to travel or access and general traffic patterns shall not be
disrupted.

conjunction with the home occupation shall not exceed ten percent of the area
devoted to the home occupation;
      (6)   Traffic. No traffic or deliveries shall be generated by such home
occupation in greater volume than would normally be expected in a residential
neighborhood;
      (7)   Objectionable activities. No equipment or process shall be used in
such home occupation which creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes or odors
detectable to the normal senses off the lot, if the occupation is conducted in

§ 8.12.180 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   When a use, structure or lot legally exists prior to the adoption or
amendment of this chapter, it shall be permitted to continue within the limits
set forth in this chapter. Under such circumstances, it is said to have
nonconforming status. It is the intent of this section to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
perpetuation. There are three types of nonconformities.
      (1)   Nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use is a use which is
prohibited under this chapter, but which was granted conditional use approval
or was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter or any
subsequent amendments.
      (2)   Nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure is one which
was lawful at the time of construction but which does not presently conform to
chapter provisions and standards for the district in which it is located.
      (3)   Nonconforming lots. Nonconforming lots are those in existence on

applicable minimum lot size or other dimensional requirements.
   (B)   Alteration. Nonconforming uses or structures may be continued but may
not be altered, extended or expanded without being in compliance with
provisions of this title. The extension or expansion of a nonconforming use to
a portion of a structure which was designed and approved for the nonconforming
use at adoption of this chapter shall not be considered an extension or
expansion of the nonconforming use. A nonconforming structure may be altered
only when such alteration is in compliance with all applicable standards of
this chapter.
   (C)   Completion of structure. Nothing contained in this chapter shall
require any change in the plans, construction, alteration, or designated use of
a structure for which construction has been approved prior to the adoption of
this chapter, provided the structure, if nonconforming or intended for a
nonconforming use, is completed and in use within one year from the effective
date of this chapter.
   (D)   Replacement. Where a nonconforming structure or a structure containing
a nonconforming use is destroyed by any cause to an extent not exceeding eighty
percent of its fair market value as indicated by the current assessment records
of the City Clerk and is not returned to its original size, locations, and use
and in actual operating condition within one year from the date of destruction,
a future structure or use on the site shall conform to this chapter.
   (E)   Conformance.
      (1)   Where a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a
nonconforming use is destroyed by any cause to an extent exceeding eighty
percent of its fair market value as indicated by the records of the City Clerk
a future structure or use on the site shall conform to this chapter.
      (2)   Where a nonconforming use is replaced by another use, the new use
shall conform to this chapter. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a
period of one year, further use of the property shall conform to this chapter.

Plan;
      (2)   Will be compatible with existing and planned land uses in the

   (D)   Action of the Planning Commission.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall make its decision concerning a
Conditional Use application within 30 days after the first public hearing on
the Conditional Use application, unless the hearing is continued.
      (2)   In rendering its decision, the Planning Commission may apply

written application, unless otherwise modified and noted by the Planning
Commission.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall cause written notification of its
action to be mailed to the applicant within 10 days after the decision has been

commence within the stated period and must be diligently pursued to completion.
Provided further, when any use of land, building, structure, or premises

§ 8.12.210 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Authorization. The Planning Commission, after public hearings, may
vary or modify requirements of this chapter where strict application would
cause an undue or unnecessary hardship. Variances will be dimensional in nature
and may be limited to requirements governing yards, lot dimensions and
coverage, heights, and parking areas. In granting a variance, the Planning
Commission may attach conditions which it finds necessary to protect the best
interests of the surrounding property or vicinity, and to otherwise achieve the
purpose of this chapter. If a dimensional variance of ten percent or less of a
standard set forth in this chapter is requested, the Director of Planning may
grant such a variance if he finds that strict application of the chapter's
standard may cause undue hardship. The Director of Planning shall report all
such dimensional variances that he grants as a Planning Determination to the
Planning Commission. If the Director of Planning denies a request for a
dimensional variance of ten percent or less, that decision may be appealed
pursuant to §
8.12.220(B).
   (B)   Procedure for taking action on a variance application. The procedure
for taking action on a variance application shall be as follows:
      (1)   Application. A written application for a variance shall be filed
with the Department of Planning. Upon filing an application for a variance with
the Department of Planning by the landowner or their authorized agent on forms
prescribed, the applicant shall be informed on the time and place of the next
regular meeting at which the application for a variance will be considered; and
      (2)   Submittal/timing.
         (a)   The application must be received at least 22 days prior to the
next regular meeting of the Planning Commission.
         (b)   The Department of Planning will provide an examination of the
City of Unalaska Real Property Tax Roll indicating that the signatures of
landowner(s) on the application form are in fact the latest owner(s) of record
to be granted the variance.
   (C)   Public hearing. Upon the filing of any such application, the Planning
Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the application. Notice of
the Public Hearing shall be given not less than 10 days prior to the public
hearing in the following manner:
      (1)   The Department of Planning will mail the notice of public hearing
to all landowners of record within 300 feet of the proposed variance area as
shown on the City of Unalaska Real Property Tax Roll; and
      (2)   The Department of Planning will post at least two copies of this
notice, printed or written, in a conspicuous place not less than 10 days prior
to the date of the hearing.
   (D)   Action of the Planning Commission.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall make its decision concerning a
variance application within 30 days after the public hearing is closed, unless
the hearing is continued.
      (2)   Approval of an application for a variance will be specifically tied
to the site plan submitted with the written application, unless otherwise
modified and noted by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall cause written notification of its
action to be mailed to the applicant within 10 days after the decision has been
rendered. Its decision shall be final unless appealed to the City Council.
   (E)   Approval. The Planning Commission may approve an application for a
variance by finding, that the request conforms to AS 29.40.040 land use
regulations, or any subsequent amendments thereto and:
      (1)   Special conditions that require the variance are not caused by the
person seeking the variance and that exceptional or extraordinary circumstances
apply to the property which do not apply generally to other properties in the
same zoning district, and result from lot size, shape, topography, or other
circumstances over which the applicant has no control. An argument of
“financial hardship” when defined as causing a developer to spend more than he
is willing to in order to conform, is not an over-riding factor in the granting
of a variance;
      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation of a property
right of the applicant substantially the same as is possessed by other
landowners in the same zoning district;
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not materially affect the
health or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood and will
not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or
improvements in the neighborhood; and
      (4)   That the variance will not be materially detrimental to the intent
of this chapter, or to properties in the same zoning district in which the
property is located, or otherwise conflict with the objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan and the variance requested is the minimum variance which
would alleviate the hardship.
   (F)   Appeals. A person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Commission
may make written request for a hearing before the City Council to appeal such
decision. For purposes of this subsection, an aggrieved person means the
applicant or landowner within the area involved or within 300 feet of the
exterior boundaries of the area involved. Such request shall contain reference
to the specific decision appealed and shall be delivered to the City Clerk
within ten working days from such ruling. Upon receipt of any such request, the
City Council will set a date for a public hearing to consider the Planning
Commission's decision and objections thereto. Notice of the Public Hearing
shall be given not less than ten (10) days prior to the public hearing in the
following manner:
      (1)   The Department of Planning will mail the notice of public hearing
to all landowners of record within 300 feet of the proposed variance area as
shown on the City of Unalaska Real Property Tax Roll; and
      (2)   The City Clerk will post at least two copies of this notice,
printed or written, in a conspicuous place not less than 10 days prior to the
date of the hearing.
   (G)   Action of the City Council. At the public hearing, the City Council
may uphold the action of the Planning Commission, reverse the action of the
Planning Commission, or modify the action of the Planning Commission.
   (H)   Decision of the City Council. The City Council shall provide findings
of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with its decision on appeal. These
findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be issued within 15 working days
after the final hearing on appeal. The decision of the City Council shall
become final and effective immediately upon the issuance of the findings of
fact and conclusions of law. No permits shall be issued concerning the property
in question until the decision becomes final. A decision of the City Council
may be appealed to the Superior Court within thirty (30) days after the
decision becomes final.
   (I)   Reapplication. No request for a variance shall be considered by the
Planning Commission within the twelve-month period immediately following a
previous denial of such request, except that the Director of Planning may
consent to a new hearing, if in the opinion of the Director of Planning new
evidence or a change of circumstances warrant it.
   (J)   Time limit for a variance. Each variance authorized under the
provisions of this chapter which is not actually established or for which the
actual construction commenced on the buildings or structures involved within
one year from the date of the decision of the Planning Commission, will be null
and void. In the event construction work is involved, it must actually commence
within the stated period and must be diligently pursued to completion. Provided
further, when any use or land, building, structure, or premises established by
variance has been discontinued for a period of one year, it shall be unlawful
to use said land or building or premises again for such use unless a subsequent
variance is again authorized and issued therefore. Permits shall require new
hearings with the Planning Commission.

§ 8.12.220 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Interpretation and application. The following principles apply to the
interpretation and application of this chapter:
      (1)   Minimum requirements. In interpreting and applying the provisions
of
Chapter 8.12 Zoning, the provisions shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general
welfare; therefore, when this
Chapter 8.12 Zoning imposes a greater restriction upon the use of the buildings
or premises, or upon the height of the buildings, or when this
Chapter 8.12 Zoning requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by
other laws or regulations, the provisions of this chapter shall control; and
      (2)   Planning determination. The Director of Planning may make a
“Planning Determination” in deciding:
         (a)   Which specific, undesignated, but similar land uses may be
permitted in a zoning district;
         (b)   Area and yard requirements for irregular lot shapes;
         (c)   Dimensional variances of 10% or less;
         (d)   Unclear zoning district boundary lines;
         (e)   Whether required subdivision improvements have been constructed;
and
         (f)   The meaning of any unclear provisions of this chapter.
      In making any “Planning Determination,” the Director of Planning must
consider the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan and
Chapter 8.12. All “Planning Determinations” shall be in written form and
reported to the Planning Commission at its next regular meeting.
   (B)   Appeals of administrative decisions.
      (1)   Procedure. Appeals may be taken to the Planning Commission by the
applicant or any affected party of any order, requirement, permit, decision, or
Planning Determination made by the Director of Planning or any administrative
official in the administration of, or the enforcement of this chapter, except
notices or orders to abate a public nuisance issued pursuant to
Chapter 11.12. Such appeals shall be filed in writing with the Director of
Planning within 10 working days of the date of the action being appealed. Upon
receipt of such an appeal, the Director of Planning shall set the time and
place, at which the matter will be considered. At least ten (10) days notice of
such time and place shall be given to the adverse parties of record and to the
official whose decision is being appealed subject to the provisions of §
8.12.220(I). The officer from whom the appeal is being taken shall transmit to
the Planning Commission all records and proceedings pertaining to the decision
being appealed, together with such additional written reports as are deemed
necessary by the Planning Commission. Citations for minor offenses are governed
by the Alaska Rules of Minor Offense Procedure and are not appealable under
this section.
      (2)   Action by the Planning Commission. In exercising the power granted
herein, the Planning Commission may, in conformity with this chapter, reverse
or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order or decision appealed from and
may make such order as should be made. The Planning Commission in making its
decision may hear any facts which it deems to be relevant.
   (C)   Appeals of Planning Commission decisions.
      (1)   Procedure. Appeals from a decision of the Planning Commission may
be taken to the City Council by a party to an appeal to the Planning Commission
or by an affected party as defined in §

printed or written, in a conspicuous place not less than ten days prior to the
date of the hearing.
         (c)   The public hearing shall be an informal hearing. The parties
involved in the appeal may be represented by counsel. Rules of evidence will
not be followed. Cross examination of persons speaking to the City Council will
not be allowed. The City Council may consider all relevant evidence. The
evidence will be heard in the following order:
            1.   Planning Department/Planning Commission.
            2.   Person appealing the Planning Commission decision.

§ 9.12.020 TAXICAB PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to operate a vehicle as a vehicle-for-hire unless
that vehicle is permitted by the City under this
Chapter 9.12.
   (B)   The City will issue taxicab permits yearly based upon application for
renewal by permit holders. The effective date of a renewal permit is the date
of issuance by the City or January 1, whichever is later. The City will issue
initial permits based upon a finding by the Council that a permit is available
and in accordance with a publicly-noticed application process as set forth in
this Chapter. The effective date of an initial permit is the date of issuance
by the City. All taxicab permits expire on the December 31 immediately
following the effective date.

§ 9.12.030 PERMITS LIMITED.
   (A)   The number of taxicab permits issued under this Chapter shall not
exceed eighteen (18). Only one vehicle may be assigned per permit at any time.
The City Council may increase or decrease the number of taxicab permits as it,
from time to time, determines to be necessary to meet the needs of the
citizens. A decision by the City Council to decrease the maximum number of
permits shall not, however, automatically constitute a cause for a revocation
or for a denial of renewal of any existing taxicab permit being actively
operated in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter.

17, passed 8-26-02)
   (B)   The City Council may at any time consider an ordinance calling for an
increase in the maximum number of taxicab permits that the City Clerk may
issue. If the Council decides that the number of authorized permits is to be
increased, the City Clerk shall publish notice that applications for a taxicab
permit are being accepted by the City and the time by which application must be
made. If more eligible persons apply than there are taxicab permits available,
the City will select the new permit holder(s) by lot from among those
applicants meeting the qualifications set forth in §
9.12.050 of this Chapter, and who has submitted a complete application for a
permit under §
9.12.040 of this Chapter.
   (C)   Upon lapse or revocation of a permit, the Council shall schedule a
public hearing on the question of whether the maximum number of taxicab permits
should be maintained. After the hearing, if the Council decides that the number
of authorized permits is to be maintained, the City Clerk shall publish notice
that applications for a taxicab permit are being accepted by the City and the
time by which application must be made. If more eligible persons apply than
there are taxicab permits available, the City will select the new permit holder
(s) by lot from among those applicants meeting the qualifications set forth in
§
9.12.050 of this Chapter, and who has submitted a complete application for a
permit under §
9.12.040 of this Chapter. A person whose permit has been revoked or non-
renewed by the City shall not be eligible to apply for a new permit or to
obtain a taxicab permit by transfer or by lease for a period of one (1) year
from the date of revocation or non-renewal (lapse) of the person's previous
permit lapsed.
   (D)   No person may have a direct or indirect financial or management
interest in more than one-fourth (1/4), increased to the nearest whole number,
of the maximum number of taxicab permits authorized to be issued at any one
time. For purposes of this division, a person has an indirect financial or
management interest in a taxicab permit or vehicle assigned to the permit if
the permit is held or owned by a member of the immediate family of that person,
or if a person is a shareholder, officer, director, general partner, limited
partner, member, economic interest holder, or holder of management rights
(other than as a mere employee) of any person which holds or owns a taxicab
permit issued by the City or which holds or owns a vehicle assigned to a
taxicab permit. Nothing in this division requires divestment of ownership or
management interests where a person owns an interest otherwise prohibited
hereunder as a result of a decision of the City to decrease the number of
authorized permits.

holder must identify a vehicle to be assigned by the City to the taxicab
permit. The vehicle to be assigned to a permit must comply with all vehicle

   (B)   LOSS OR DAMAGE: Immediately upon the destruction, substantial damage,
or loss of a motor vehicle assigned to a taxicab permit the permit holder shall

permit for the vehicle shall be revoked. If the permit holder provides the
Director of Public Safety with a written statement from an automobile repair
shop, auto parts supply business, or car dealer advising that required parts
are not available, the Director of Public Safety may extend the time to repair
the vehicle for a period not to exceed an additional ninety (90) days. Approval

9.12.040, and verification from the Department of Public Safety that the
vehicle complies with the vehicle marking requirements of §
9.12.160(A) and has passed a vehicle safety and meter inspection which shall
constitute a completed application. Upon receipt of a completed application the
City Clerk shall take such action as may be necessary to assign the new vehicle
to the permit. Upon reassignment of a replacement vehicle to a permit, it shall
be a violation of this Chapter to continue to operate the prior-assigned
vehicle as a vehicle-for-hire in the City.

permit in good condition and repair and in compliance with this Chapter at all
times. The inspections conducted by a Qualified Mechanic shall not diminish the

in good condition in compliance with this Chapter, nor shall it constitute an
assumption of all or any part of that duty by the City of Unalaska.
   (D)   A legible notice or placard setting forth the fares charged to
passengers shall be displayed on the dashboard between the drivers’ seat and
the passengers’ seat in a manner that is visible to passengers in the back
seat.

director, employee or managing agent of a permit holder, or by a driver whether
the driver is an employee of the permit holder or an independent contractor,
may be imputed to the permit holder for purposes of any actions to revoke,
suspend or to deny renewal of the permit.

permit holder, may authorize a voluntary suspension of the permit for a single
period not to exceed three (3) months in any consecutive twelve (12)-month

justified by reduced seasonal passenger traffic, or will not adversely affect
the public convenience and necessity, and that suspension is reasonably
necessary for the economic welfare of the permit holder.
   (B)   If an application for a voluntary suspension is denied, the applicant
may appeal the decision pursuant to §
9.12.130.

§ 9.12.130 PROCEDURE FOR DENIAL, REVOCATION OR IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF TAXICAB
PERMIT OR CHAUFFEUR'S LICENSE.
   (A)   NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE. Prior to initiation of any proceeding to
deny eligibility for or to revoke a taxicab permit or a chauffeur’s license the
City Manager, in the case of a taxicab permit, or the Director of the
Department of Public Safety, in the case of a chauffeur’s license, shall issue
to the applicant, permit holder or licensee a notice of noncompliance with the
requirements of this Chapter. The notice shall identify the basis for action or
decision against the applicant, permit holder, or license and shall specify a
period of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, within which the applicant,
permit holder, or licensee may demonstrate compliance with the requirements of
this Chapter.
   (B)   IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION. If the City Manager or Director makes a
determination that the permit holder or licensee has failed to maintain
insurance required by §
9.12.040(B) or that the permit holder, licensee or use of a permitted vehicle
presents an immediate threat to the health and safety of the public, the City
Manager or Director may issue a written notice of noncompliance stating the
reasons for the immediate suspension, that the suspension shall be effective
immediately, and that the permit holder or licensee has a right to request a
hearing on the decision of immediate suspension before the City Manager to be
held within three (3) business days of that request. The City Manager may
extend the time for the date of holding the hearing at the request of the
licensee or permit holder, or upon good cause shown by the Director. A
determination that the permit holder or a licensee presents an immediate threat
to the health or safety of the public shall be based upon reasonable cause that
the vehicle assigned to a permit fails to comply with applicable vehicle safety
codes or that a condition creates an immediate and substantial risk of harm to
passengers or the public if the vehicle is used for hire or if the licensee
were to continue to operate a vehicle for hire. After the hearing, the City
Manager shall issue a decision as to whether to uphold or to rescind the
immediate suspension. The suspension shall remain in effect until the permit
holder or licensee presents evidence to the City Manager demonstrating that the
required insurance is in place, that there is not a substantial risk of harm to
passengers or the public and shall remain in place through any subsequent
process to revoke the subject permit or license. A permit holder or licensee
may appeal the decision of the City Manager after hearing to the City Council
pursuant to division (D), below.
   (C)   NOTICE OF INTENT TO REVOKE. Where the City Manager or the Director of
the Department of Public Safety is not satisfied that the applicant, permit
holder or licensee has presented sufficient evidence or information to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, the City Manager
or the Director may issue a notice of intent to deny the application or to
revoke a permit or license. Notice by City Manager, in the case of a taxicab
permit, or by the Director of the Department of Public Safety, in the case of a
chauffeur’s license, notifying an applicant, permit holder, or licensee that
the City intends to revoke their permit or license or to deny their application
shall be served on the applicant, permit holder, or licensee via first-class
mail, postage pre-paid or in person. The notice shall state the reasons for the
proposed action and that the proposed action shall take effect upon the
expiration or thirty (30) days unless earlier appealed by the applicant, permit
holder or licensee to the City Council.
   (D)   APPEAL. An appeal of a notice of intent to deny or revoke or of an
immediate suspension shall be made no later than thirty (30) days from the date
of the notice issued by the City Manager or the Director. The time for appeal
shall be computed pursuant to §
1.12.060(C). Upon receiving a timely notice of appeal, the City Clerk shall put
the appeal on the agenda for a public hearing at a regular meeting of the City
Council to be held within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of appeal from
the applicant, permit holder, or licensee. The Council shall hear the appeal de
novo and the parties to the appeal may be represented by counsel and present
witnesses and evidence on their own behalf and shall have the right to cross
examine witnesses and rebut evidence against them. The hearing shall be
memorialized by an electronic recording. After the close of the hearing, the
Council shall issue written findings affirming, rescinding, or modifying the
decision of the City Manager or of the Director.
   (E)   An appeal from any final decision of the Council shall be to the
Superior Court, and shall be made no later than thirty (30) days following
service via first-class mail, postage pre-paid, or in person of that decision
upon the affected licensee or permit holder at their last known address. Review
by the court shall be limited to determining whether the decision appealed is
supported by substantial evidence. The time for appeal to Superior Court shall
be computed pursuant to §
1.12.060(C).

   (A)   Any person desiring to be served by any City utility shall make
application in writing with the City. The application must be signed by the
applicant or by the applicant's duly-authorized agent. In the event that the
applicant is not also the owner of the property to be served, the owner or the

the private contractor’s name for billing purposes.
   (C)   The minimum term for which service will be rendered is one (1) month
or thirty (30) days. Any consumer taking service for less than this minimum
term will be billed for not less than the minimum monthly charge specified
under the applicable rate schedule.
   (D)   The City reserves the right to refuse to provide utility service to an
applicant where the applicant has not made arrangement to assure payment,

codes, and/or, where it is not feasible, economically or technically, for the
City to provide a particular utility service.

§ 10.04.035 BASIC CONDITIONS FOR EXTENDING UTILITY SERVICE(S).
   (A)   Approval and acceptance of an application for utility service
extension will be subject to the following requirements and conditions:
      (1)   Information disclosure. The applicant must fully disclose to the
City the class, scope, and type of use to be made of the service including a
full description of, and detailed information related to, the location of the
subject property.
      (2)   Property to be served. Except as otherwise provided in this
Chapter, service connections shall not be installed where the distance between
the boundary of the property being served and the main or primary line is
greater than three hundred (300) feet, or where the service line passes through
real or personal property not owned by the applicant, or where the service line
passes through more than one parcel of real property, unless utility easements
are provided.
      (3)   Capacity, location, and feasibility. Approval of extending utility
services shall be contingent upon the availability of capacity, the location of
main distribution/collection lines or facilities required to serve the subject
property, and upon technical and economic feasibility as determined by the
City.
      (4)   Contract to comply. The application shall constitute a contract
between the City and the applicant as a consumer to pay for service in
accordance with applicable rate schedules on file with the City and to comply
with the applicable provisions of this Title 10.
      (5)   Construction deposits. All applicants for electric, water, and
wastewater service extensions shall deposit at least fifty percent (50%) of the
applicant's estimated share of the cost of any work to be completed by the
City. The applicant's estimated share of the cost of the work will be provided
to the applicant by the City. The deposit shall be made to the Department of
Finance before the start of any extension work. The balance of the applicant's
share of the cost of the work shall be paid by the applicant upon completion of
the work.
      (6)   Excavation permits. No one may dig or excavate on City property, or
on City- owned or controlled rights-of-way, or easements without an excavation
permit issued by the City.
      (7)   Credit application. All persons applying for utility services shall
complete a utility service credit application to establish credit with the
City.
      (8)   Other terms and conditions. Applicants shall comply with all other
terms and conditions relating to particular utility services as may be required
by this Title 10.
   (B)   Easements. In instances where the City determines that providing
electric, water, or wastewater utility service requires the location of
electric, water, or wastewater equipment and/or main lines on the applicant's
property, the applicant shall be required to grant a utility easement at no
charge to the City, appropriate in size, nature, and location to accommodate
the installation and on-going maintenance of the equipment and/or main lines
needed to serve the subject property. The equipment and/or main lines may be
used to serve the properties of other consumers if the service does not change
the size, nature, or location of the equipment and/or main lines and if it does
not otherwise create an additional burden upon the burdened subject property.

   (B)   Access. The consumer shall provide the City with access to the
consumer’s property at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading meters,
testing, inspecting, repairing, or replacing any equipment which is the
property of the City, and for conducting quality control testing for the City’s
water and wastewater systems. Where City property or equipment is located in a
secured area, the consumer shall supply the City with keys to the locks or

§ 10.04.040 RATES, DEPOSITS, AND BILLINGS.
   (A)   All rates, charges, and fees for utility services shall be established
by the City Council by ordinance.
   (B)   New consumers will be assigned to a utility rate schedule based upon
information presented in the application for utility service extension and upon
the best professional judgment of City staff.
   (C)   When a consumer desires service on a rate schedule other than the one
on which the consumer is being billed, the consumer shall notify the City in
writing and, if approved, the rate change shall become effective on the first
day of the next billing cycle. The City shall not be required to make more than
one change in rate schedule for any consumer within a one-year (1) period
(measured from the date the last date the rate change was made) unless a new
schedule is made effective or unless the consumer’s operating conditions have
changed permanently so as to warrant a change in their rate schedule. The City
shall not be liable to any consumer for retroactive fees or charges under a
rate schedule that has been determined to be inapplicable, unless the consumer
made a written request for a change in a rate, was entitled to the change
requested, and the City refused to make the change in rate schedule. A consumer
may appeal a denial for a rate change under §
10.04.045(B). The City’s liability to refund any overpayment to a consumer for
any retroactive rate change shall be limited to the period after the consumer
provided the City with written notification of a request for a rate change, and
is further subject to the procedures set out in §
10.04.045.
(Ord. No. 2001-05, passed 5-8-01; Am. Ord. 2005-18, passed 10-5-05)
§ 10.04.042 DEPOSITS FOR UTILITY SERVICE.
   (A)   Required. A consumer seeking to receive utility services from the City
shall pay to the City a billing deposit prior to the activation of any utility
service.
   (B)   Billing deposit refunds. The billing deposit shall be applied to the
consumer’s account after two (2) years, provided that the consumer has
maintained their account in good standing and the City has not been forced to
disconnect that consumer’s service for reason of delinquency in payment of
charges, and provided the consumer has not been delinquent in payment more than
once in any twelve (12) consecutive months. If the consumer does not meet these
conditions at the end of two (2) years, the deposit will be retained until
twelve (12) consecutive months of timely payment history has been established.
Alternatively, the consumer’s billing deposit, less the amount of any unpaid
balance due for utility service or late fees, shall be refunded with accrued
interest by the City within thirty (30) days of rendition of the final bill.
Interest shall accrue on the amount of the deposit at the rate specified in the
City’s fee and rate ordinance.
   (C)   Successors in interest. A consumer’s interest in any return of a
deposit to which the consumer may be entitled shall pass to the consumer or to
the consumer’s heirs, successors, or to others to whom the consumer’s interest
has been assigned. No assignment of a right to the deposit shall be effective
unless it is in writing and filed with the City. It is the responsibility of
the consumer to provide the City with the consumer’s mailing address. The City
has no obligation to make a refund to any person for whom it has not been
furnished a current address.
(Ord. No. 2001-05, passed 5-8-01; Am. Ord. 2005-18, passed 10-5-05)
§ 10.04.044 BILLING PROCEDURES AND COLLECTION.
   (A)   Metered services.  
      (1)   Meter reading. Meters will be read monthly by the City at
approximately the same time each month. The consumption of service indicated by
the meter shall be the basis for computing bills for electric and water (where
metered) utility service and shall be accepted conclusively as correct by the
consumer and the City, except where the meter is found to be registering
inaccurately or has ceased to register. If for any reason, a reading cannot be
obtained for a particular period, billings shall be based upon an estimate
determined from historical data and adjusted, if necessary, in the following
billing period.
      (2)   Combined meter billing.
         (a)   Single meter generally required. Service measured through two
(2) or more meters on the same subject property for purposes of billing will
not be allowed except as follows:
            1.   When two (2) or more service connections are necessary to
provide service at the least expense to the City;
            2.   When two (2) or more service connections are necessary to
render proper and reliable service without undue interruption; or
            3.   When two (2) or more meters are necessary to ensure an
accurate utility billing.
         (b)   Separate billing for each meter.  In the event two (2) or more
meters are installed for a single subject property, bills for service through
each meter will be computed and billed separately.
      (3)   Multiple rate classifications. When a consumer desires to use water
or electricity for purposes classified under different rates, separate water or
electrical meters must be installed to measure the water or electricity
supplied at each rate. The water or electricity registered by each meter will
be charged as specified by the City’s fee and rate ordinance.
      (4)   Access to meter. If, because of action or inaction by the consumer,
the City cannot reasonably gain access to read the consumer’s meter, the City
may discontinue service under §
10.04.050(C).
      (5)   Meter testing. In order to ensure accuracy, the City will inspect
and test meters. Special tests will be made upon request by a consumer. If the
meter is found to register more than two percent (2%) high or low, the City
will adjust the consumer’s billing for the known or estimated period of error,
not to exceed the previous six (6) months. For special tests made upon request
of a consumer, there will be no charge to the consumer if the meter is found to
have more than two percent (2%) error; otherwise, the consumer shall be charged
pursuant to the City’s fee and rate ordinance.
      (6)   Additional meters. Any additional meters desired by an owner other
than those necessary to adequately measure the service received at the subject
property shall be provided, installed, owned, and maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
   (B)   Unmetered services. Unmetered services shall be charged a flat monthly
rate as provided in the City’s fee and rate ordinance. Flat fees for water and
sewer will be charged for each dwelling unit served regardless of whether more
than one (1) dwelling unit is connected to a single service.
   (C)   Billing and Payment Procedures.
      (1)   Bills shall be deemed rendered, and other notices duly given, when
delivered to the consumer in person or when deposited in the United States mail
and directed to the consumer at their last known mailing address furnished by
the consumer. Bills will be sent on a monthly basis and are due and payable on
the due date printed on the bills.
      (2)   All bills will be considered delinquent if not paid by the due date
printed on the bill and shall bear interest as provided by the City’s fee and
rate ordinance until the balance is paid in full. Failure of the consumer to
make payment within twenty-five (25) days from the due date will subject the
consumer to disconnection or discontinuance of service under §
10.04.050. The City may, at its discretion, make contracts for payment of
delinquencies.
      (3)   All payments due under this Chapter may be applied in the following
order:
         (a)   late charges due, beginning with the oldest late charge first;
         (b)   interest charges, if applicable;
         (c)   any charges due, other than costs of utility services rendered,
as required by this Chapter; and
         (d)   costs of utility services rendered, beginning with the service
fees due from the oldest delinquent bill.
      (4)   Responsibility for payment.
         (a)   Utility service credit application. Prior to activation of
service by the City, applicants shall be required to complete the utility
service credit application available at the City’s Department of Finance.
         (b)   Failure to receive a bill. Failure to receive a bill from the
City for any given period of time shall not relieve the consumer of the
responsibility of full payment for service(s) provided. Consumers are liable
for payment for all service delivered to consumer’s premises or otherwise
rendered until the consumer provides the City with written notice that the
service is no longer desired. (See §
10.04.050(A))
         (c)   Property owner responsibility for payment. Regardless of who
occupies any premises, residence, or other structure, and regardless of who
receives the benefit of the utility service, the real property owner is liable
for all utility charges for service to the property, including without
limitation monthly charges, connect and disconnect fees, other charges,
penalties, and interest.
         (d)   Ownership change no impact on liability. A change in ownership
will not relieve the property owner of liability for accruing utility charges
until the City Finance Department actually receives from the property owner a
notice to terminate all services, or receives and approves a new application
for service from a new property owner.
      (5)   Insufficient funds checks. Any check given to the City that is
returned by a financial institution for insufficient funds is subject to a
returned check charge and/or penalties as specified by City ordinance and as
may be provided by Alaska Statutes. The City may require any consumer having
two (2) or more checks returned by a financial institution for nonpayment
within any twelve-month period to pay future bills only by cash, cashier’s
check, or money order thereafter.
      (6)   Change of occupancy. When a change of occupancy or of ownership
takes place on any premises being served by the City, written notice of the
change shall be given to the City’s Finance Department at least five (5) days
prior to the change. The consumer will be held responsible for all service
supplied to a subject property until written notice to terminate service has
been received by the City.

2010-12, passed 9-28-10)
§ 10.04.045 OVERPAYMENT REFUND.
   If a consumer has remitted utility payments in excess of what is due to the
City, the consumer may apply to the City for a refund within one (1) year of
the date the overpayment was made. The City shall audit the consumer’s account
and may request any additional information the City requires to determine that
a refund is due. If the City determines that a refund is due, the City shall
pay the refund with interest at three and one- half percent (3.5%) per annum
beginning thirty (30) days from the date of payment. In the event that the City
determines that a refund is due and the consumer has other outstanding
delinquencies due to the City, the City may first apply any refund to those
outstanding delinquencies and then remit any remainder to the consumer. A claim
for refund not filed within one (1) year of the over-payment date is forever
barred.

§ 10.04.046 SERVICE AND BILLING COMPLAINTS; APPEALS.
   (A)   Complaints. All complaints concerning delivery of utility services are
to be delivered to the Department of Public Utilities either in person, by
mail, by facsimile, or by telephone. All complaints concerning utility bills or
payments are to be delivered in writing to the Finance Department either in
person, by mail, or by facsimile. Any complaints will be answered as
expediently as can be accomplished.
   (B)   Appeals. If a complaint by an owner or a consumer is not resolved to
their satisfaction at the departmental staff level, the owner or consumer may
appeal the decision in writing first to the Department Director. If the
complaint is not resolved at the department level, the consumer may appeal the
decision in writing to the City Manager. All appeals must be filed with the
City Manager in writing, by mail, or by facsimile, along with any supporting
documentation, and must be received by the City no later than thirty (30) days
after the decision of the Department Director. The consumer’s administrative
remedies shall not be considered exhausted until all appeals have been made and
decisions rendered. The owner or consumer may appeal the City Manager’s
decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the superior court within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of the City Manager’s decision.
(Ord. No. 2001-05, passed 5-8-01; Am. Ord. 2005-18, passed 10-5-05)
§ 10.04.050 DISCONNECTION AND DISCONTINUANCE OF UTILITY SERVICE.
   (A)   Consumer-initiated disconnections. Consumer requests for disconnection
of service(s) must be submitted to the City in writing. Request to disconnect
service must be submitted in writing to the Finance Department. All requests,
including requests for refunds of deposits, must be signed by the consumer or
by their attorney-in-fact or duly-authorized agent, by an officer of the duly-
authorized corporate agent, representative of an association, corporation, body
politic, or governmental agency, or by both husband and wife, if the service
was connected in the name of both. In the case of rental property, an owner who
is not an applicant may request disconnection upon the written consent of the
applicant.
   (B)   Disconnection for cause - nonpayment.
      (1)   All utility bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill. If any bill is not paid by or before that date, the bill is
delinquent. After delinquency, the City shall provide the person receiving
services and the property owner with a minimum of one (1) written notice mailed
or delivered to the person and the property owner at their last known address,
that service may be discontinued for nonpayment unless the delinquent charge is
paid in full or unless other payment arrangements are made with the City. If a
bill is not paid within twenty-five (25) days of the due date, the City may
discontinue utility service to the property without further notice.
      (2)   Any person disputing a bill shall have a right to file a complaint
with the City as described in §
10.04.046(A). All complaints concerning billing matters shall be lodged with
the Department of Finance no later than thirty (30) days after the due date of
the disputed bill. If the matter is not resolved at the department staff level,
the person disputing the bill may file an appeal under §
10.04.046(B).
      (3)   The City shall not discontinue utility service where a complaint
has been filed under §
10.04.046(A), except upon at least ten (10) days' prior notice and the
provision of a written decision notifying the person receiving services and the
property owner of the City's decision on the complaint and identifying the
amount due. Where an appeal is filed with the City regarding a billing dispute,
the City may require the person filing the appeal to tender payment or partial
payment of the disputed sums pending the decision or risk disconnection. If the
person filing the appeal prevails, any disputed sums will be returned with
interest at three and one-half percent (3.5%) per annum from the date of
payment.
   (C)   Disconnection for cause - other.
      (1)   Upon giving at least five (5) days’ written notice to the consumer,
the City may discontinue service for any one (1) or more of the following
causes:
         (a)   The consumer or their agent uses or attempts to use utility
service with the intent to defraud the City of payment.
         (b)   The consumer or their agent uses utility service to further an
illegal purpose or to advance any purpose other than that described in the
consumer’s application for utility service or for extension of utility service.
         (c)   The consumer or their agent re-sells or redistributes water or
electricity in violation of the City’s fee or rate schedules or in violation of
any provision of this Title.
         (d)   The consumer, their agent, or invitee tampers with any service
connection, key box, meter, meter seal, or other property of the City. Evidence
of a broken meter seal or the insertion of a by-pass will require the consumer
to pay for the estimated quantity of water or electricity that has been
delivered and not registered, plus the cost to restore the meter to the proper
working order and any other necessary expense or charge.
         (e)   The consumer, their agent, or invitee, refuses the City of
reasonable access to the subject property for the purpose of inspecting,
reading, repairing, or removing a meter or other City equipment.
         (f)   The consumer, or their agent, refuses to comply with and/or
violates the requirements of this Title.
         (g)   The consumer refuses or fails to repair any defect or leak in
the consumer’s service line by a date established in writing by the Director of
Public Utilities.
         (h)   The consumer or their agent refuses or fails to protect City
facilities or equipment, or interferes with or permits another person to
interfere with the City’s facilities or equipment. If the equipment or
facilities are damaged, or seals placed on the equipment or facilities are
damaged or removed, the City will discontinue service until satisfactory
assurance has been provided that the equipment or facilities will be free from
future interference. The consumer shall reimburse the City for any damage to
the equipment or facilities and for the estimated loss of revenue prior to the
restoration of service.
      (2)   Where, in the judgment of the Director of Public Utilities, an
imminent health or safety hazard exists, the City may disconnect or discontinue
the utility service immediately and without prior notice to the owner or to the
consumer. In such case, subsequent written notice of the basis for
disconnection and/or discontinuance of service shall be provided to the owner
and or to the consumer within twenty-four (24) hours of the disconnection or
discontinuance of service.
      (3)   Any consumer disputing disconnection or discontinuation of service
notice for cause under this subsection may file a complaint with the Department
of Public Utilities as described in §
10.04.046(A). If the matter is not resolved at the department staff level to
the satisfaction of the consumer, the consumer may file and appeal under §
10.04.046(B).
      (4)   The City shall not disconnect or discontinue utility service where
the consumer has filed a complaint under
10.04.046(A) except upon at least an additional five (5) days’ notice and the
provision of a written decision notifying the consumer of the City’s decision
on the complaint. Where, in the judgment of the Department Director, an
imminent health and/or safety hazard exists, the City may disconnect or
discontinue service while a complaint is pending.
      (5)   In addition to disconnection or discontinuance of utility service
(s), the conduct identified in subparagraph (C)(1)(a-h) may subject the
consumer and/or their invitee or agent to additional penalties set forth in §
10.04.080, plus any surcharge required to be imposed by AS 12.55.039. The City
may also elect to abate a violation which constitutes a public nuisance under
Chapter 11.12.
      (6)   When a notice is given that an act to correct a violation under
this Title is required to be done at or within a specified time, the Director
may, in their discretion, order the period enlarged if the consumer and/or
owner requests an extension of time for good cause shown prior to the
expiration of the period originally prescribed (or as extended by a previous
order) or, upon request made after the expiration of the specified period, the
Director may extend the time for the act to be done where the failure to act by
the consumer and/or owner was the result of excusable neglect.

§ 10.04.055 RESTORATION OF UTILITY SERVICE.
   (A)   Where the City has disconnected or discontinued utility service, the
City shall restore service only after the consumer or owner has complied with
the following conditions:
      (1)   The consumer shall pay all delinquencies for all utility-related
services, including interest, and penalties.
      (2)   The consumer may be required to pay an additional deposit where the
consumer has had an account balance that was twenty-five (25) days or more past
due at least once in the prior twelve (12) months or a balance that was ninety
(90) days or more past due within the past three (3) years. The utility deposit
shall be equal to three (3) times the normal monthly usage charge estimated by
the City.
      (3)   The consumer has corrected, to the City’s reasonable satisfaction,
all conditions in violation of this Title of which the consumer was previously
provided notice.
   (B)   If a former consumer, who is indebted to the City due to non-payment
for utility- related service(s), requests new or additional utility services,
the City may refuse service until the consumer pays the delinquency.
   (C)   When service is disconnected for nonpayment or for violation by the
consumer of this Title, the City may apply the billing deposit against the
account of the consumer, and the balance, if any, will be refunded under §

§ 10.04.060 EXTENSION OF PRIMARY UTILITY SERVICES.
   (A)   General. Upon application to the City and approval by the City
Council, primary electric, water, and wastewater utility services may be
extended by the City or by private developers along any public right-of-way
and/or easement. Please refer to §
10.04.035. The methods by which utility extensions may be accomplished are as
follows:
      (1)   Extensions by the City may be done either by use of general taxes,
utility revenues, bonds or grant funds, or by assessment of individual property
owners for all or a portion of the costs of the extension through the creation
of a Special Assessment District (also known as Local Improvement Districts or
LID’s) pursuant to AS 29.46 and
Chapter 6.16 of this Code.
      (2)   Private extensions may be accomplished by private developers who
are willing to privately finance the utility extension.
   (B)   Utility extensions by City.
      (1)   Non-assessed utility extensions by City. Upon determining that an
electrical, water, or wastewater utility extension will benefit the community
or the utility system, the City may, at its discretion, and upon its own
initiative, extend any part of its utility system(s) without assessing
individual property owners.
      (2)   Assessed utility extensions by City. Pursuant to AS 29.46 and
Chapter 6.16, the City may create a special assessment district and levy
assessments against real property to be benefitted by the improvement for all
or a portion of the cost of acquiring, installing, designing and/or
constructing capital improvements.
   (C)   Utility extensions by private developers.  The following shall be
followed by a private developer desiring to extend or expand a City utility
system.

constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable if introduced into the
potable water supply.
      (5)   System hazard. An actual or potential threat of severe damage to
the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer’s
potable water system or of a pollution or contamination that would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
   (W)   “WATER SERVICE CONNECTION” means a pipe, key box, meter, and other
appurtenances, used to conduct and deliver water from the main to a point at or
near the property line of the subject property, except in the case of extended
service connections. It is considered the terminal end of a service connection
from the public potable water system, that is, where the water provider loses
jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to
the consumer’s water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service
connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the
meter. There shall be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of
any meter or backflow-prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to
the consumer’s water system. Service connection shall also include water
service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency
water service connections from the public potable water system.
(Ord. No. 2001-05, passed 5-8-01; Am. Ord. 2005-18, passed 10-5-05)
§ 10.12.015 FACILITY DESCRIPTION.
   The City’s water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the
utility system and the consumer system.
   (A)   Utility system consists of the source of facilities and the
distribution system, and shall include all those facilities of the water system
under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the consumer’s
system begins. The source shall include all components of the facilities
utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the
distribution system. The distribution system shall include the network of
conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the consumer’s
system.
   (B)   The consumer’s system includes those parts of the facilities beyond
the termination of the utility distribution system that are utilized in
conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
(Ord. 2005-18, passed 10-5-05)
§ 10.12.020 SERVICE CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Water utility services are subject to the following conditions and
requirements:
      (1)   Availability. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, water
service is contingent upon the availability of system capacity and location of
main distribution lines or facilities relative to any property to be served.
      (2)   Point of delivery. The point of delivery is where the consumer’s
service line connects to the downstream side of the curb stop at the water
service connection. Unless authorized by the City in writing, water supplies
from one water service connection may not be used to provide or deliver water
to another person or subject property otherwise eligible to receive water
service.
      (3)   Service connection procedures. The City will provide materials for
and install or supervise the installation of service lines from the main line
to the point of delivery at the property line including the key box. The owner
shall install and maintain the service line from the key box to the point of
use. Any work at the point of delivery must be inspected by the City prior to
activating and burying the connection to the City’s water delivery system. The
owner will be charged for all work completed and materials provided by the City
according to the City's fee and rate schedule. The following provisions apply
specifically to metered connections:
         (a)   Meters required. Water service to industrial, commercial, and
multi-family residential buildings having three or more units will be metered
and charged for actual usage. Duplex and single family dwellings may be metered
at the consumer’s request.
         (b)   Meters provided by City. Where a meter is required by this
Chapter, the City will provide at its expense, but not install, a suitable
meter for each consumer's water service connection. The City will determine the
size, type, and placement of the meter. The City will withhold service pending
the proper location and installation of the meter by the owner. The meter will
remain the sole property of the City; provided, however, that the consumer
shall pay for any damages to the meter or other City property arising from the
consumer's negligence.
         (c)   Plumbing apparatus. The owner shall cause to be placed, at the
owner's expense, the necessary plumbing apparatus for meter placement as
indicated by the City's standard specifications.
         (d)   Removal and reinstallation. The charges for removal and
reinstallation of a meter due to the negligence of the consumer will be based
upon time and materials as set by the City's fee and rate ordinance.
         (e)   Meter replacement. The City reserves the right to remove and
test any meter at any time and to install another meter in the place of the one
it removed.
      (4)   Extended water service connections. In cases where mains have not
been installed within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property, the
owner of the subject property may be eligible for an extended service
connection by signing an extended water service connection agreement and
agreeing to, among other terms, the following:
         (a)   Location and charges. A standard connection and key box
installation shall be installed by the City at a point on the water main
designated by the City. The owner shall pay the standard time and materials
charges as provided in the fee and rate ordinance.
         (b)   Expense. The service line shall be extended by the owner at the
owner's expense.
         (c)   Maintenance. The owner shall own and be responsible for
maintenance of the service line from the point where the line connects to the
City's curb stop.
         (d)   Future connection. At such time as mains are extended or
installed to a point within three hundred (300) feet of the property being
served, the property owner must connect to the extended main and abandon the
old service at the main and pay the time and materials costs and charges for
continuation of service. Any work at the point of delivery must be inspected by
the City prior to activating connection to the City’s water delivery system.
      (5)   Condition for receiving water service. Where sewer service is
available within three hundred (300) feet of any property line of the property
to be served, no person shall receive water service who has not previously made
application for a wastewater service connection.
   (B)   Consumer/owner responsibilities.
      (1)   Responsibility and ownership. The owner shall retain ownership of
and be responsible for maintenance of the water service line downstream from
and including the connection with the curb stop.
      (2)   Compliance with City specifications. The consumer shall comply with
all applicable standard specifications of the City. Specifications, known as
Installation Guidelines, are available at the Department of Public Utilities.
No person shall be permitted to connect to the City's water system while still
physically connected to any other source of water supply, unless the provisions
of backflow/cross-connection regulations as provided in this Chapter and the
City's standard specifications are met. The City reserves the right to refuse
or to disconnect service whenever the City receives notice or has reasonable
cause to believe that the consumer's service is in hazardous condition or does
not conform with the City’s Installation Guidelines and/or any other applicable
laws or regulations.
      (3)   Access. By accepting water service, the consumer agrees to allow
the City’s designated representative, upon presentation of proper
identification, to enter upon the consumer's premises at all reasonable hours
for the purposes of service inspection and/or to set up devices as are
necessary to control, sample, monitor, or measure water flow.
      (4)   Maintenance and use requirements.
         (a)   Service line. The consumer’s service line located between the
key box and the subject property of the consumer shall be kept in repair by the
owner or occupant of the subject property, who shall be responsible for all
damages other than those caused by acts of the City. In the case of a frozen
water service, the consumer shall be responsible for thawing the service line
from the main to the building, unless the freezing condition can be
demonstrated to have been the result of the City's negligence.
         (b)   Meter protection. The owner or consumer shall provide, at the
owner's or consumer's expense, a clean, dry, safe place for the meter which
place is not subject to a great variation in temperature, so that the meter
will be protected from freezing and other hazards and is so located as to
control the entire supply and so as to be easily accessible for installation,
maintenance, reading, and disconnection.
         (c)   Electrical grounding systems. The City will not be liable for
the adequacy of any electrical grounding electrodes for electrical circuits and
devices as may be attached by the owner to the owner's service pipe and
plumbing system. This method of grounding involves an element of danger, and
the City will not be liable for the safety of any person who makes contact with
the owner's service pipe and plumbing system that is used as an electrical
grounding system. The City reserves the right to make any structural or
material changes it so desires in the installation of the City's water mains
and water service connections without regard to the effect the changes may have
on the overall adequacy of an electrical grounding system utilizing the owner's
service pipe and plumbing system.
         (d)   Connections and alterations. Approval from the City shall be
required to make any connections to or alterations in any conduit, pipe, or
other fitting connecting directly to the key box, or to turn water service off
or on at the key box.
         (e)   Separate shut-off valve. All consumers receiving service from
the City shall provide a separate shut-off valve inside the building for which
service is being requested or provided. The valve shall be located on the
service line entering the structure, ahead of any branch lines, where it is
readily accessible in the event of emergency.

Penalty, see §10.04.080
§ 10.12.030 SPECIAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Hydrant use. It shall be unlawful for anyone except City personnel to
operate any City fire hydrant without a hydrant use permit.
   (B)   Cross-connection control.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to:
         (a)   protect the public potable water supply of the City from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the consumer’s
internal distribution system(s) or the consumer’s private water system(s) such
contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the public water system;
and,
         (b)   promote the elimination or control of existing cross
connections, actual or potential, between the consumer’s in-plant potable water
system(s) and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial
piping systems; and,
         (c)   provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
      (2)   Responsibilities. The City desires to protect the public potable
water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow
of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the
judgment of the Director, an approved backflow-prevention assembly is required
(at the consumer’s water service connection or within the consumer’s private
water system) for the safety of the water system, the Director or the
Director’s designated agent shall give notice in writing to consumer to install
such an approved backflow-prevention assembly(s) at specific location(s) on the
consumer’s premises. The consumer shall immediately install such approved
assembly(s) at their own expense. The failure, refusal, or inability on the
part of the consumer to install, have tested, and maintain said assembly(s)
shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until
such requirements have been satisfactorily met.
      (3)   Water supply protection. No water service connection to any
premises shall be installed unless the water supply is protected as required by
state laws and regulations and this Chapter. Service of water to any subject
property shall be discontinued by the City if a backflow prevention assembly
required by this chapter is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is
found that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an
unprotected cross connection exists on the subject property. Service will not
be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
      (4)   Right to inspect. The consumer’s system shall be open for
inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the City to
determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards,
including violations of these regulations, exist. When it becomes known that
such a condition exists, the City shall deny or immediately discontinue service
to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the
consumer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the Chapter
relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (5)   When a Backflow Prevention Assembly is Required. Wherever the
following conditions exist, an approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be
installed on each service line to a consumer's water system at or near the
property line or immediately inside the structure being served; but, in all
cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line:
         (a)   In the case of subject property having an auxiliary water supply
that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that
is not accepted as an additional source by the City, the public water system
shall be protected against backflow from the subject property by installing an
approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the
degree of hazard.
         (b)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any
other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an
actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow-prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of
hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters
originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in
quality.
         (c)   In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connections
that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing
and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, rendering it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the subject
property by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service
line.
      (6)   Type of Assembly Required. The type of protective assembly required
under subsections 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c) shall depend upon the degree of hazard
that exists as follows:
         (a)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply as stated in subsection 5(a) of this section and it is not subject to
any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an
approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-
prevention assembly.
         (b)   In the case of any premises where there is water or substance
that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved
double check valve assembly.
         (c)   In the case of any premises where there is any material
dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these
conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations,
docks, seafood processing plants, slaughter houses, chemical manufacturing
plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants.
         (d)   In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross
connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
         (e)   In the case of any premises where, because of security
requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or
impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public
water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an
approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-
prevention assembly on each service to the premises.
         (f)   In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the
Director, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely
toxic substances, the Director may require an air gap at the service connection
to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion
of the Director and is dependent on the degree of hazard.
      (7)   Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly. Any backflow-prevention
assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the City. The
term approved backflow prevention assembly shall mean an assembly that has been
manufactured in full conformance with the current standards established by the
Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (FCCCHR) of the
University of Southern California.
         Final approval shall be evidenced by a "Certificate of Approval"
issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with
current AWWA standards and FCCCHR specifications.
         Backflow preventers that have been fully tested and have been granted
a certificate of approval by an approved laboratory may be used without further
testing or qualifications.
      (8)   Duty of consumer. It shall be the duty of the consumer at any
premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified
inspections and operational tests made at least once per calendar year. In
those instances where the Director deems the hazard to be great enough,
certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These
inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be
performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, Water Department
personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the Director. It shall be the
duty of the Director to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The
consumer shall notify the Director in advance when the tests are to be
undertaken so that the City may witness the tests if so desired. These
assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the
consumer whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such
tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the Director.
      (9)   Exclusions. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies
that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies
for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been
properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance
requirements under subsection 8, be excluded from the requirements of these
rules so long as the City reasonably believes that they will satisfactorily
protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the
present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the City
finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be
replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements
of this section.
   (C)   Interconnections. Interconnections between two or more public water
supplies are prohibited except upon written approval of the City.
   (D)   Inspections. In order to assure compliance with City health and safety
standards, all applications for building permits shall be reviewed by the
Director to ensure that all plumbing is installed in a manner as to prevent the
possibility of pollution of the City's water supply. Upon giving proper notice,
and in compliance with applicable state and federal law, the Director may
inspect any building or premise in the City to ensure that all plumbing has
been installed so as to prevent the possibility of pollution of the City's
water supply. City water service shall be immediately disconnected from any
structure or subject property whose plumbing system has been installed in a
manner that the Director reasonably believes could cause pollution to the
City's water supply, pursuant to §
10.04.050(C)(2). The service shall remain disconnected until the plumbing
problem has been corrected.

(again) meet the standard discharge limitations required by the City. The
consumer shall assume all costs necessary for the consumer to remediate their
noncompliance and to ensure future compliance with City standards.
      (2)   External sampling point. As part of remediation, the consumer shall
provide a secure external sampling point accessible to the City for sampling
during any hour. This sampling point shall be installed on the consumer's
wastewater service line and shall be large enough to accommodate automatic
sampling equipment in use by the City.
      (3)   Laboratory analysis. Laboratory analysis of discharges from the
consumer's wastewater service line will be required for the consumer to
demonstrate compliance with standard discharge limitations after a period of
noncompliance. Because the consumer's discharge to the City's wastewater system
may adversely affect the City's ability to comply with the conditions of its
NPDES permit or with other federal or state standards, the City shall set the
laboratory analysis parameters, the frequency of continued testing, and the
reporting requirements which the consumer must meet to remediate the violation
and to prove continued future compliance. The City shall set these parameters
by balancing the needs of all users of the wastewater system with the
requirements of tis permits and ordinances and with state and federal law.
      (4)   Pretreatment equipment. The consumer may find it necessary to
install new or additional pretreatment equipment in order to remediate their
failure to adhere to the standard discharge limitations of §
10.16.026. Due to the potential of adverse affects of any such equipment and
treatment process upon the City's WWTP and its wastewater service and main
lines, the consumer must obtain advance approval from the Director of the use
of any such equipment and of the time and manner of proposed installation by
the consumer prior to its installation.
      (5)   Remediation period. The Director shall provide a remediation period
of up to six (6) months from the date of the written notice of noncompliance in
order to allow the consumer to alleviate its noncompliance with §
10.16.026. The remediation period shall depend upon the extent of noncompliance
and the extent and nature of the adverse effects to the City's WWTP processes,
equipment and permit requirements, and the adverse effects to the environment
of continued noncompliance. The more severe of an effect, the less time the
Director may allow to the consumer to remediate the noncompliance. The Director
may impose different remediation schedules for different areas of noncompliance
with the standard limitations but may not provide for a remediation period in
excess of six (6) months for any violation from the date of notice of
violation.
      (6)   Extension of remediation period. If the consumer fails to comply
with standard discharge limitations within the remediation period, the City may
discontinue service to the consumer under §
10.04.050(C) unless the consumer files a written request for an extension of
the remediation period with the City Manager prior to the expiration of the
remediation period. The consumer's request for extension shall state the basis
of the request, why remediation could not be earlier accomplished and shall
identify the specific extension requested. A copy of the request shall also be
filed by the consumer with the Director. Prior to the Manager's review, the
Director shall provide the City Manager and the consumer with information about
any Industrial Pretreatment Program (§
10.16.026(F)) which may be required in the event of an extension of the
remediation period, with the projected costs of that program, and with any
other information relevant to the matter. Any response to the Director's
submission to the City Manager and/or any request for a hearing before the City
Manager shall be made in writing to the City Manager (with a copy to the
Director) by the consumer within seven (7) days. The Manager may grant or deny
an extension request in whole or in part, and may require as a condition of any
extension of the remediation period that the consumer pay additional costs to
the City by reason of the extension and make deposit or otherwise secure
payment for those projected excess costs. The City shall provide continued
service during this review unless the Director concludes that continuing to
provide service creates an imminent threat to the City's ability to comply with
state water quality standards, to the City's ability to comply with the
requirements of its NPDES permit, and/or to human health or safety.
   (E)   If the consumer fails to comply with the service conditions and
requirements of this
Chapter 10.16, the City may refuse to provide service to the consumer or may
discontinue service under §
10.04.050(C).

§ 10.16.024   SERVICE CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS - CITY.
   (A)   Responsibility and ownership. The City will maintain and keep its main
lines and service lines outside the subject property line free from freezing
and blockage; provided, however, that the City shall not be responsible for
negligence of third persons or forces beyond its control resulting in any
interruption of service or damage to a consumer's real or personal property.
   (B)   Refusal of service. The City reserves the right to refuse to provide
wastewater service until proper building permits have been issued, equipment
installed, arrangements made to assure payment for service installation costs,
and until the subject property passes any inspection required by this Chapter.
(Ord. No. 2005-18, passed 10-5-05)
§ 10.16.026   STANDARD DISCHARGE LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Flow.  No user may discharge or cause to be discharged either directly
or indirectly more than 0.0249 Million Gallons Per Day (MGD) of wastewater into
the municipal sewage system. Any single user wastewater flow that routinely
averages 0.025 MGD or greater will constitute a Significant Industrial User and
require the City to develop an Industrial Pretreatment Program in accordance
with EPA regulations.
   (B)   Standard Discharge Limitations.  To further protect the City's WWTP
processes and discharge requirements from general and non-significant
industrial users, the City adopts the following technically-based limits. The
Acute Toxicity limitation listed in the following table means that an LC50 of
less than 100% shall be considered toxic by the City. No user may discharge or
cause to be discharged into the City's wastewater collection system, either
directly or indirectly, any wastewater containing concentrations of pollutants
in excess of the following:

   (C)   Surcharges. Any users that are found in violation of these discharge
limits may be subject to surcharges. The following is an example of a surcharge
formula and calculation:
      Example Surcharge Formula and Calculation:
      Monthly Surcharge Rate = bo Bl + so Sl
      V1 = Volume of waste water from industrial users, Gallons per month.
      bo = Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to BOD, dollar/pound.
      B1 = Weight of BOD (amount above 500 mg/L limit) from industrial users,
lbs/month.
      so = Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to SS, dollar/pound.
      S1 = Weight of TSS (amount above 500 mg/L limit) from industrial users,
pound/month.
         Industrial User's Flow = 0.025 MGD
         Industrial User's BOD = 600 mg/L
         Industrial User's TSS = 800 mg/L
         WWTP Annual Budget = $2,000,000
         WWTP Average BOD = 215 mg/L
         WWTP Average TSS = 250 mg/L
         WWTP = 0.600 MGD
      V1 = 0.025 x (365 / 12) x 1,000,000
      V1 = 760,417 Gallons/Month
      Cost per pound to treat BOD (bo) =
      bo = ($2,000,000 / 12) / [365 x (215 x 8.34 x 0.600)]
      bo = $0.42 / Lb of BOD per Month
         B1 = (600 - 500) x 8.34 x (V1 / 1,000,000)         B1 = 634 lbs/month
         Cost per pound to treat TSS (so) =
         so = ($2,000,000 / 12) / [365 x (250 x 8.34 x 0.600)]
         so = $0.37 / Lb of TSS per Month   
         S1 = (600 - 500) x 8.34 x (V1 / 1,000,000)         S1 = 1903 lbs/month
      Monthly Surcharge Rate = ($0.42 x 634) + ($0.37 x 1903) = $970.39
   (D)   Exceptions. Any user that wishes to discharge wastes in excess of the
limits of this section shall obtain written and signed approval by the
Director, and shall maintain a signed copy of this written permission at their
main business premises. The Director may allow exceptions only for a limited
time and only where technically based calculations determine that the City's
WWTP processes will not be adversely affected and where the WWTP discharge will
not violate any parameter in their NPDES permit nor violate any water quality
standard. Surcharges may also apply.
   (E)   Pretreatment. The City may require the installation and proper
maintenance of filters, grease traps, or other devices determined by the City
to be necessary to ensure compliance with this division (A).
   (F)   Industrial Pretreatment Program. According to federal regulations, the
City will be required to develop an Industrial Pretreatment Program for
Significant Industrial Users (SIU) whenever it is determined that any single
user discharge averages 0.025 MGD or greater, or 5% or more of the WWTP Dry
Weather Hydraulic or Organic Loading. The City will also be required to develop
user specific technically based discharge limits for each SIU in accordance
with EPA requirements and obtain approval of the user specific limits from EPA.

§ 11.12.010 ABATEMENT OFFICIAL.
   The Chief of Police, Fire Chief, Director of Planning, or city building
official may abate any nuisance that is prohibited by this title. When used in
this title, “abatement official” includes any of these officers or their
designated representatives.
(Ordinance No. 98-04)
§ 11.12.020 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES; SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of the abatement official, upon discovery or upon
receiving notice of any nuisance prohibited by this title, to immediately
notify the offender to abate and remove the same within a time limit specified
by the abatement official as more fully set out in §
11.12.030 of this chapter. The abatement official or any other person
authorized to do so may also issue a citation for a violation of
Chapter 11.08 at any time a nuisance is believed to exist. Any proceeding
instituted for such a violation is separate from and shall not affect the
abatement process provided for in this chapter.
   (B)   The abatement official may abate any public nuisance without notice in
an emergency where the public safety, comfort or repose is seriously annoyed,
injured or endangered to the point where immediate action is necessary and
notice cannot be timely given. All abatement proceedings provided in this
chapter, except the giving of notice, shall apply to the nuisance summarily
abated, including the recovery of the costs of the summary abatement.
(Am. Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)
§ 11.12.030 NOTICE TO ABATE; WHEN NOTICE NOT REQUIRED.
   (A)   Unless a nuisance has created an emergency situation which requires
immediate abatement, the abatement official shall issue an abatement notice and
order direct to:
      (1)   The record owners of the affected property; or
      (2)   The person committing, creating, or maintaining the public
nuisance; or
      (3)   The occupant of the affected property.
   (B)   The notice shall contain:
      (1)   The street address and legal description sufficient for
identification of the affected property;
      (2)   The statement that the abatement official has found the property
affected with a public nuisance with a brief and concise description of the
public nuisance as defined in this title;
      (3)   A statement of the action required to be taken as determined by the
abatement official to abate the public nuisance by rehabilitation, repair,
demolition or other action sufficient to cause the nuisance to be wholly
abated;
      (4)   A statement advising that if any required abatement is not
commenced or completed within the time specified the abatement official may
proceed to cause the necessary work to be done and charge the cost thereof
against the property or its owner. The abatement officer, in computing the time
allowed for abatement, will take into consideration the possible necessity of
the individual having to obtain professional contractual assistance and the
delays one might reasonably encounter in the contractor's scheduling of the
project; and the possible necessity of obtaining materials from outside the
city and subsequent delays therefore.
      (5)   That any person having record title or legal interest in the
property may appeal from the notice and order of any action of the abatement
official to the City Council by filing with the City Clerk within 15 days from
the date of service of such notice and order an appeal in writing in accordance
with the appeal procedure as provided in §
11.12.090.
      (6)   Failure to appeal will constitute a waiver of all right to contest
the order.

the public streets and rights-of-way, city properties and parks or for summary
abatement when permitted.

      (3)   The owner of any other estate or legal interest of record in or to
the property affected with the public nuisance;
      (4)   The person in possession of the property.

be served shall not invalidate any proceedings herein as to any other person
duly served or relieve any such person from any duty or obligation imposed on
him by the provisions of this section.
§ 11.12.050 METHOD OF SERVICE.
   Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all persons entitled
thereto either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice and order by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid return receipt requested, to each
such person at his address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll
of the city or borough or as known to the abatement official. If no address of
any such person so appears or is known to the abatement official, any copies of
notice or order shall be so mailed addressed to such person, at the address of
the property involved in these proceedings. The failure of such person to

a nuisance has expired, the abatement official shall proceed to abate the
nuisance at the expense of the city, unless:

observed and substantial justice done.
   In exercising its powers, the Council may reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from. To reverse any order, requirements, decision or determination,
or decide in favor of the appellant, or to make exceptions to or variations
from this chapter, the concurring vote of the majority of the Council shall be
required.

lesser time as the Council shall order. However, the considerations cited in §

setting time constraints for abatements.
§ 11.12.100 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Generally. After any order of the abatement official or the Council

nuisance shall constitute a lien upon the affected property, and a notice of
lien for amounts described in this section may be recorded in the office of the
district recorder, Aleutian Islands Recording District, Third Judicial

interest, penalties and costs due and owing to the city, the city shall file a
certificate discharging the lien. In an action to enforce a lien, the court

§ 11.20.020 REFUSE DISPOSAL.
   All property owners or occupants of premises within the boundaries of the
City of Unalaska are required to dispose of their garbage in the municipal

landfill disposal established by the City Council. All refuse shall be disposed
of at intervals sufficient to protect the public health and well being.
§ 11.20.030 SERVICE REQUESTS; RATES AND BILLINGS.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the customer to apply for landfill

in effect until the customer requests the municipality to discontinue the
service. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to notify in writing at
least two weeks prior to the effective date of any changes that may affect the
monthly charges.
   (B)   Billings.
      (1)   Billing for landfill service will commence with the date of
occupancy. The municipality shall have the right to determine how and to whom
landfill charges are to be billed. Failure to receive a bill or failure to
apply for service does not relieve the customer of responsibility for the
charges.
      (2)   All landfill charges shall be the obligation of the owner of the
property served by the municipality. In the case of an apartment complex where
the tenants receive individual bills, the total of which does not equal the
current rate which would be billed to the property owner on a single billing,
the owner shall be responsible for the difference due the municipality. Credit
for vacant residential units may be extended if the period of vacancy exceeds

governing the collection for utility bills shall apply in every particular in
collection of landfill service bills, and the delinquency in case of one bill
shall be deemed a delinquency in all bills.
      (6)   There shall be imposed a lien in favor of the city upon the
property being served whenever a billing or billings remain unpaid for a period
of 60 days or more for the landfill or utility service. The property being
primarily liable for the payment of these services, the lien arises at the time
of delinquency and continues until the liability for the amount is satisfied,
or the lien is foreclosed. Such liens shall be foreclosed in the manner
provided by law or ordinance for the foreclosure on properties for failure to
pay the sales tax or any other tax, including real property tax due and owing
to the city.

such premises, if not properly kept, and to add the cost thereof to the utility
bill of such person, and to prosecute such person for noncompliance with this
chapter.
   (E)   Customers using containers larger than one cubic yard shall provide
and maintain a hard surfaced pad on the property for locating the unit and
shall maintain the pad so that the container is accessible and moveable for
collection. The area on and around the pad will be kept free of debris so as
not to endanger the collector or his vehicle.

   No person may dispose of any refuse in a facility not approved by the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation in the City of Unalaska.

   (A)   Rules for naming:
      (1)   It is within the desires of the City of Unalaska to reflect the

15.12.080   Violation and penalties
§ 15.12.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a uniform street addressing
system within the city limits of the City of Unalaska whereby all lots and/or
structures on a parcel shall be assigned a street address.
§ 15.12.020 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   ADDRESS - means a number in combination with a street name which
defines the approximate location of a lot or structure on that street.
   (B)   LOT - means a parcel of land, no matter how legally described, whether
by metes and bounds or by lot and block designation as in a recorded plat.
   (C)   RIGHT OF WAY - means a land reserved, used, or intended to be used for
street, alley, walkway, or other public purposes including utilities.
§ 15.12.030 OFFICIAL STREET ADDRESSING SYSTEM.
   (A)   PREFIXES - N, S, W, E, shall be used where appropriate or necessary.
Prefixes combining 2 directions shall be avoided, i.e. NW or SE.
   (B)   ORIGIN - The established starting point for the addressing shall be
referred to as the Origin and is a reference for all streets and their
addresses. The Origin shall be the intersection of Broadway Avenue and 5th
Street.
   (C)   ODD/EVEN NUMBERING - Lot on the North and East sides of streets shall
be assigned odd numbers. Lots on the South and West sides shall be assigned
even numbers.
   (D)   Diagonal Streets - Lots on an apparent NE or SW axis shall be numbered
according to their predominant direction from the streets starting point. A
perfectly diagonal street shall be arbitrarily assigned even or odd numbering
on one side by the Planning Commission. Consistency shall be maintained
throughout any street length.
§ 15.12.040 STREET ADDRESSING.
   Due to the uniqueness of the road infrastructure of the City of Unalaska,
addressing will be discussed in parts.
   (A)   Downtown Unalaska. Numbers shall rise from the Origin (Broadway Avenue
and 5th Street). Numbering from the Origin shall begin with zero in each
direction.
   (B)   Other streets, rights-of-way. A street shall rise in numbers from the
beginning of that street that is closest in possible travelled distance to the
Origin. For example, a loop shall be numbered from the ingress closest to the
Origin.
   (C)   Numbering increments. For the purposes of the City of Unalaska's
unique road system, a numbering system based on miles and fractions of miles
shall be used.
Fractional Miles Feet Numbering Increment
Fractional Miles Feet Numbering Increment
1/128            41   8
1/80             66   12
1/64             82   16
1/40             132  25
1/32             165  31
1/20             264  50
1/16             330  62
1/10             528  100
1/8              660  125
1/5              1056 200
1/4              1320 250
1/2              2640 500
1                5280 1000
1 1/28           5321 1008
1 1/20           5544 1050
1-1/2            7920 1500
 
Example: Down Town Unalaska - Broadway running in a predominantly western
direction from the origin shall be addressed 100 W. Broadway Avenue at 1/10
mile on the Southerly side of that street (in this case the left side from the
Origin).
   (D)   Individual address. Individual businesses and single family dwellings
shall each have a separate number. Duplexes will receive two numbers. Apartment
buildings with a common entrance will have one number followed by an apartment
designation (A, B, C or 1, 2, 3 etc.).
   (E)   Multi-family dwelling units and office complexes. Each shall have a
street number with individual apartments/suites/offices designated by either
alphabetical suffix (i.e. 101A, 101B, etc.) or numerical designation (i.e. 101
4th Ave. Apt. 200).
   (F)   Multiple entrances. Large buildings with multiple entrances including
apartments, shall have a number for each entrance that faces a road or street.
   (G)   Corner parcels. Corner lots will be assigned as number depending on
which direction the main entrance faces.
§ 15.12.050 INTERPRETATION.
   Nothing in §
15.12.040 should be interpreted so as to prevent the Planning Department from
deviating on a case by case basis from the standards when necessary to produce
a more consistent numbering system where topography or other physical
limitations dictate.
§ 15.12.060 MAINTENANCE OF ADDRESSES.
   The City of Unalaska Planning Department will be responsible to assign all
building numbers for permanent structures based upon the method outlined in
this ordinance. The property owner of a building with an assigned address is
responsible for displaying and maintaining the assigned number in a conspicuous
location which is clearly visible from the road which the address is assigned,
with the numbers being no smaller than four inches high. The number should be
placed on the building, and when the building is not visible from the road, the
number should be also placed at the primary entry driveway. The property owner
is encouraged if possible to place numbers in areas that are not only
conspicuous, but that may be lighted when it is dark outside.
(Am. Ord. 2024-12, passed 10-8-24)
§ 15.12.070 [RESERVED].
§ 15.12.080 VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.
   If after a period of one year from the effective date of address assignment
a property owner has failed to comply with §
15.12, then the property owner will be subject to penalties described in §
1.24.010 - General Provisions; General Penalties.

event that a city crew must be called to perform any maintenance on any
lighting devices, or other means of protecting the public due to the failure of
the contractor to comply with this regulation, a service call fee of fifty
dollars per location will be billed to the responsible private firm or
individual by the city. No payments on any contract with the city will be made
until all such fees are paid in full.

any public place, or whenever further investigation will supply information
necessary to properly evaluate the application for the permit.
(Am. Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)
§ 15.20.030 HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS; REMEDY.
   (A)   Whenever an excavation or fill within or outside a public place has
caused or contributed to a condition that appears to substantially impair the
lateral support of the adjoining street or public place, or endangers the

take such action as he deems necessary to protect the public, the adjacent
streets, or street utilities or to maintain the lateral support thereof,
including placing of temporary shoring, backfilling, alteration of drainage
patterns and any other action reasonably necessary to decrease the possibility
or extent of earth movement, or regarded as necessary safety precautions; and
the owner and/or contractor shall be liable to the city for the costs thereof.

inform himself as to the existence and location of any and all underground
utilities apt to be encountered during his operation and shall protect the same
against damage.

§ 15.24.020 APPLICATION; CONTENTS.
   Applications for permits herein provided for shall be filed with the
Director of Public Works, upon a form furnished by him. Such applications shall
contain:
   (A)   An accurate description of the public place or portion thereof desired
to be used;
   (B)   The use desired to be made of such public place by the applicant;

shall be shown on the plans in relation to the proposed work.
§ 15.24.030 APPLICATION; PROCESSING.
   Permits shall be obtained at least two working days before the work is
commenced, and shall not be transferred or assigned except as provided herein.
The Director of Public Works shall examine each application to determine if it
complies with the provisions of this title and may inspect the premises which
are desired to be used in order to ascertain any facts which may aid in
determining whether a permit shall be granted. If the Director of Public Works
finds that the application conforms to the requirements of this title
pertaining thereto, and also that the proposed use of such public place will
not unduly interfere with the rights of the public, he may approve the
application. If the application is approved, the Director of Public Works shall
issue a permit, upon the applicant's compliance as herein specified with the
provisions of this title relative to bond and indemnity. The permit shall
provide a time limit within which the work shall be completed, and work shall
commence within ten days after application is approved. Unless an extension of
time is granted by the Director of Public Works, the permit shall be void if
the work is not commenced and completed within the dates stated.
§ 15.24.040 AGREEMENT BY PERMITTEE.
   Every permit issued by the city shall contain a statement signed by the
permittee which shall provide substantially as follows:
   (A)   The permittee shall be responsible for all claims and liabilities
arising out of work performed, or arising out of failure to perform his
obligations with respect to street or other maintenance incidental to the
permitted work. The permittee shall agree to forever indemnify, defend, save
and hold harmless the city, its officers and employees, from and against any
and all law suits, claims or actions brought by any person for or on account of
damages to property, or injury, disease, illness or death of person, including
all costs and expenses incident thereto, arising wholly or in part from or in
connection with the existence of construction, alteration, maintenance, repair,
renewal, reconstruction operation, use or removal of the work to be performed.
   (B)   The permittee agrees that the permit is wholly of a temporary nature,
that it vests no permanent right whatsoever, that upon thirty days notice,
posted on the premises, or by publication in a newspaper of the city, or
without such notice, in case the permitted use shall become dangerous or such
structures shall become insecure or unsafe, or shall not be constructed,
maintained or used in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance of the
city, the permit may be revoked and the structure and obstructions ordered
removed.
   (C)   If any structure or obstruction, or use or occupancy, is not
discontinued on notice so ordered by the Director of Public Works, he may
forthwith remove such structure or obstruction from such place, or make such
repairs upon the structure or obstruction as may be necessary to render the
same secure and safe, at the expense of the grantee of the permit, or his
successor, and such expense may be collected from the permittee as provided by
law.
§ 15.24.050 BOND OR INDEMNITY DEPOSIT ON APPROVED APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Cash deposit. If the Director of Public Works determines that there is
a possibility of damage or expense to the city arising from an applicant's
proposed use of any public place, the applicant shall furnish to the city a
surety bond, cash or certified check, payable to the city, to be in an amount
not less than $200. The cash deposit shall be in an amount determined by the
Director of Public Works at the time of approving the application. The deposit
shall be used to pay the cost of the permit as specified in §
15.24.090, and to pay for any possible extra expense that the city may be
called on to pay. Additional expense items may include additional inspectors,
surveys or other services performed by the city above those included within the
permit fee, the costs of restoring the street and removing any earth or other
debris from the street, the replacement of any utility interrupted or damaged,
the completion of any work left unfinished, and any other expense the city may
sustain in conjunction with the permitted work. In the case of a cash indemnity
deposit the balance, if any, after the foregoing deductions shall be returned
to the applicant; if the deposit be insufficient the applicant will be liable
for the deficiency.
   (B)   Bond. If a surety bond is filed, the bond shall assume all the
requirements provided in subsection (A) of this section in relation to a cash
indemnity deposit, shall run for the full period of the permit, and shall be
conditioned that such applicant shall faithfully comply with all the terms of
the permit and all the provisions of this title and all other ordinances of the
city. Such bond shall indemnify and save the city free and harmless from any
and all claims, actions or damages of every kind and description which may
accrue to, or be suffered by, any person by reason of the use of any public
place, as provided for in said application. The bond shall be approved as to
form by the City Attorney.

the circumstances and length of duration of a bond, cash or certified assurance
required to cover possible damage and repairs which may result from the
permittee's construction. If the application shall be to construct,
reconstruct, repair, maintain, or remove any sidewalk, pavement, grading,
underground installations of any kind, or other work which affect the integrity
of the street or other public place, the applicant shall file a surety bond,
approved as to form by the City Attorney, which bond shall run for the full
period of the permit plus one year after the acceptance of the permitted work
by the Director of Public Works. The amount of the bond shall be in an amount
fixed by the Director of Public Works and conditioned that the applicant shall
faithfully complete all portions of the work according to the special plans and
other data approved or specified by the Director of Public Works.
§ 15.24.060 ADDITIONAL BOND.
   (A)   Where it is probable that more than one permit will be desired, or
that an applicant shall be periodically using public places, the applicant may
of his own volition, or the Director of Public Works may require the applicant
to post a surety bond of sufficient amount to cover the accumulated cost or
risk involved at any certain time in a calendar year for a number of permits
outstanding as determined by the Director of Public Works, said bond to be in
force during the period of all outstanding permits, but in no case for less
than one year. The bond shall be approved as to form by the City Attorney,
conditioned to assume all of the requirements provided in §
15.24.040 in relation to a cash indemnity deposit.
   (B)   However, if at any time any applicant applies for a permit to use a
public place, and in the opinion of the Director of Public Works the work or
risk involved in the application shall, together with other permits outstanding
in the name of the applicant, exceed the amount of the presently posted surety
bond, the applicant may be required to post an additional or separate surety
bond to cover the additional risk or work involved prior to the issuance of any
new permits. The bond shall remain in force during the period of all
outstanding permits, but in no case for less than one year.
   (C)   In addition, the Director of Public Works may require any permittee to

utility district, public corporation, or political subdivision which is
authorized by law to establish or maintain any works or facilities in, under or
over any public street, alley or right-of-way.
   (B)   Permittees falling within this category will instead be required to
furnish a certified statement assuring the city that any and all costs for
repair of damage to the street or public place or installations within it will
be at the liability of the permittee when it has been determined by the
Director of Public Works that there is a reasonable basis to require such
protection.
   (C)   No bond, certified statement or permit fee will be required of the
various city departments or divisions nor of a city contractor where the
contract documents specifically require approved progress schedules and a
complete coverage performance bond.
   (D)   This section, however, shall not relieve any person of the
responsibility of obtaining the permit.

the requirements for bonding or certified assurances.

(Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-26-2021)
§ 18.12.020 SAFEGUARDING.
   (A)   Vessel operators shall not anchor a vessel in such a way as to
endanger other vessels moored or at anchor. Should a conflict arise between
anchored vessels, the previously anchored vessel shall have right-of-anchorage,
and the subsequently anchored vessel shall have the burden of changing
anchorage.
   (B)   Vessel operators shall ensure that each vessel in their charge has
sufficient scope and ground tackle to preclude dragging of the anchor in all
weather conditions.
   (C)   Vessel operators, while anchored within the port, shall maintain a
radar or visual watch from the bridge of the vessel to ensure that each vessel
in their charge maintains its position.
   (D)   Vessel operators shall maintain a radio watch on VHF channel 16 while
anchored in the port.
   (E)   Vessel operators shall obtain permission from the Harbormaster before

(Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-26-2021)
§ 18.12.030 RECKLESS OPERATION.
   It is unlawful for any person to operate or cause to be operated a vessel in
a reckless manner. For the purpose of this section “in a reckless manner” means
either (1) in willful or wanton disregard of the rights or safety of others, or
(2) in a fashion that creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm to
person or property. A substantial and unjustifiable risk is a risk of such
nature and degree that the conscious disregard of it or a failure to perceive
it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable
person would observe in a similar situation.
§ 18.12.040 NEGLIGENT OPERATION.
   It is unlawful for any person to operate or cause to be operated a vessel in
a negligent manner. For the purpose of this section, “in a negligent manner”
means in such a manner as to create an unjustifiable risk of harm to a person
or to property and which, as a result of the creation of the risk, actually
endangers a person or property. An unjustifiable risk is a risk of such a
nature and degree that a failure to avoid it constitutes a deviation from the
standard of care that a reasonable person would observe under the
circumstances. Proof that a defendant actually endangered a person or property
is established by showing that, as a result of the defendant's act or omission:
   (A)   A collision occurred; or
   (B)   A person, including the defendant, took evasive action to avoid a
collision; or
   (C)   A person, including the defendant, stopped or slowed down suddenly to
avoid a collision; or
   (D)   A person or property, including the defendant or his property, was
otherwise endangered.
§ 18.12.050 UNLAWFUL ACTS.
   (A)   It is unlawful for any person to:
      (1)   Operate a vessel, boat or skiff within a restricted waterway at a
speed in excess of 10 knots (11.5 MPH), or at a speed which produces a wake,
wash or wave action which may or could reasonably be expected to damage any
other vessel or port facility or create discomfort to an occupant of another
vessel by causing such other vessel to yaw, pitch, shear or heave because of
such wake, wash or wave action. “Restricted waterway” includes the Iliuliuk
River, the East Channel of Iliuliuk Harbor, or any water within 100 yards of
any private dock, pier or wharf;
      (2)   Throw or otherwise cause or permit to be deposited petroleum
products, oil, litter, trash, garbage, or refuse on any float or into the
waters of the port;
      (3)   Create or maintain any nuisance within the port, or conduct or
carry on any unlawful business or occupation therein;
      (4)   Erect, place, post, or maintain any advertising matter, sign, or
other printed matter, other than legal notices, on any part of the port
facilities without approval thereof first being obtained from the Harbormaster.
All unauthorized advertising and signs may be removed by the Harbormaster;
      (5)   Deposit, place, or leave any cargo, merchandise, supplies, freight,
articles, or thing upon any dock, float, ramp decline, walk or other public
place in the port facilities, except at such place or places as may be
designated as loading areas by the Harbormaster;
      (6)   Fail to register with the Harbormaster any vessel occupying any
city port facility;
      (7)   Tap, connect, disconnect, interfere with, or tamper with any
electrical wiring, electrical outlet, or electrical device of any kind
installed or maintained at the port facilities by the city without first having
obtained the permission of the Harbormaster;
      (8)   Interfere with or tamper with any wharf, float, gangplank, ramp,
associated water system or any appurtenance of the port facilities;
      (9)   Tie up at, enter or otherwise use an Open or a Reserved Mooring
Space except as provided for in this title;
      (10)    Disregard, deface, remove, tamper with or damage any sign or
notice posted or erected by or at the direction of the Harbormaster or by
direction of the Public Works Department and relating to the use of the port
facilities;
      (11)    Operate a searchlight or other bright light in the port in a
manner that will temporarily blind or interfere with the vision of any
pedestrian, operator of a motor vehicle or the operator of any other vessel,
except in the case of an emergency;
      (12)    Refuse to comply with any lawful order of the Harbormaster or his
representatives;
      (13)    Fail to maintain a proper radar or visual watch from the bridge
of a vessel for which that person is the vessel operator, while the vessel is
at anchor within the port;
      (14)    Fail to maintain a radio watch on VHF channel 16 while a vessel
for which that person is the vessel operator is at anchor within the port; or

Harbormaster or his representatives.
      (16)    Operate a vessel in a reckless manner under §
18.12.030;

such a manner as to create a floating or sunken hazard within the city
boundaries. For purposes of this ordinance, a “floating or sunken hazard” may
include any boat houses, floats, scows, rafts, pile drivers, other floating
structures, or any boat, vessel, or floating structure which is or may become
or create a fire hazard, a hazard to navigation, or otherwise become a menace
to the safety of the community.
(Am. Ord. 2016-02, passed 2-23-16)
§ 18.12.060 REPORTING VIOLATIONS.
   Complaints of any violations of the foregoing prohibited acts shall be made
to the Harbormaster or his designated representatives or, in their absence, to
the Department of Public Safety for the City of Unalaska.
§ 18.12.070 EXEMPTION OF AUTHORIZED EMERGENCY VESSELS.
   (A)   The provisions of this title shall not apply to any authorized
emergency vessel actually responding to an emergency call or in immediate
pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law, within the purpose for
which such emergency vessel has been authorized; provided that the provisions
of this section shall not relieve the operator of an authorized emergency
vessel of the duty to operate with due regard for the safety of all persons,
nor shall it protect the operator of such vessel from the consequence of
reckless disregard for the safety of others; provided further that the
provisions of this section shall in no event extend any special privilege or
immunity in the operation of an authorized emergency vessel for any purpose
other than that for which has been authorized.
   (B)   In a case where loss of life, personal injury and/or substantial
damage to property or natural resources occurs or is threatened, an authorized
emergency vessel actually responding to such casualty may, when the operator of
such emergency vessel in good faith believes it to be necessary and
appropriate, operate such emergency vessel in a way that produces a wake, wash
or wave action which may or could be expected to damage another vessel or
property therein or create discomfort to an occupant of another vessel;
provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply when such wake,
wash or wave action itself could lead to loss of life, personal injury and/or
substantial damage to property or natural resources.
§ 18.12.080 EMERGENCY POWERS.
   Where necessary to expedite vessel traffic, to prevent or eliminate
congestion, or to safeguard persons or property, the Harbormaster, or in the
event of fire or other emergency the Harbormaster and other authorized officer
of appropriate governmental agencies or authorities, may direct vessel traffic
as conditions may require, notwithstanding the provisions of this title.
§ 18.12.090 DISTURBING THE PEACE.
   Any person who disturbs the quiet enjoyment of other users of the port, by
action or lack of action, shall be subject to revocation of mooring privileges
and shall be required to vacate the port or port facility immediately. Examples
of disturbing others include, but are not limited to, the following: loud
music, unnecessary noise, or loud talking between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and
7:00 a.m., allowing a vessel to deteriorate; accumulation of trash, refuse, or
garbage; allowing a vessel to become a nuisance, attractive or otherwise.
Failure to comply with the Harbormaster's revocation of mooring privileges or
order to vacate may result in impoundment under
Chapter 18.20 of this title. The remedies of this title are in addition to any
civil and criminal remedies the Harbormaster, city, State of Alaska, or any

mooring space shall be required to pay a mooring facilities fee.
   (B)   The mooring facilities fee schedule applicable to mooring spaces
located within each port facility shall be set out in that facility’s operating
plan.
   (C)   Individuals who wish to cancel their reservations to their mooring or
stalls, upon notification to the Harbormaster of their intention, shall be
allowed a rebate of the fee paid, if and to the extent permitted by that
facility’s operating plan.
   (D)   The vessel operator of a vessel that is being occupied, lived on,
rented or leased as a place of human habitation or a primary residence shall be
charged the regular fee for a reservation of a mooring space plus an additional
fee to be set by ordinance per calendar month. This additional fee is payable
on a monthly basis in advance on the first day of each calendar month. The city
may waive the additional monthly fee if the vessel operator or occupant
notifies the Harbormaster in writing prior to the calendar months in question,
stating the dates that the vessel will be vacant, and that the vessel will be
occupied for less than 15 days in the calendar month, and that the vessel is no
longer used as a primary residence during that period.
(Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-26-2021)
§ 18.16.030 MOORING FACILITIES USE FEE.
   Vessel operators utilizing open harbor mooring facilities shall be required
to pay a mooring facilities use fee as set by ordinance.
§ 18.16.040 OTHER FEES.
   Other fees relating to port facilities fees shall be set by ordinance.
§ 18.16.050 HARBORMASTER SERVICE FEES.
   (A)   The Harbormaster may from time to time, but without any obligation or
duty to do so and without any obligation or liability on his part or that of
the city for his failure to do so, replace defective mooring lines, pump
vessels which are in a dangerous condition for lack of pumping, or move any
vessel occupying any mooring space for the purpose of protecting such vessel or
other property from fire or other hazard. Whenever the Harbormaster performs
any of the acts herein above authorized, after having given the best possible
notice under the circumstances to the vessel operator of the immediate need
therefor, the vessel operator shall pay the city the appropriate fee as
prescribed by ordinance.
   (B)   The city shall hold and retain a lien, maritime or otherwise, against
a vessel that is liable to the city for Harbormaster service fees assessed
under subsection (A) of this section to the extent such lien is allowed by
applicable federal and state law. The city may, at its option, enforce and
foreclose such lien by suit in rem pursuant to applicable federal and state
law. Such suit shall not preclude the city from pursuing any other remedy at
law or in equity.
§ 18.16.060 PAYMENTS.
   (A)   All fees or charges provided for under this title shall be paid to the
order of the City of Unalaska at the Harbormaster's office or at Unalaska City
Hall.
   (B)   Any person who fails to pay a fee or charge due under this title, at
the time and place when such fee or charge is due, shall be liable to the city
for the amount due. If payment is not made within 60 days of the due date
interest at the rate of 10.5% per annum shall accrue. The city shall also be
entitled to all attorney's fees and costs in collection of amounts due under
this title. The right of the city to pursue collection under this subsection
shall not preclude the city from pursuing any other remedy at law or equity.
(Ord. No. 98-19, passed 6-23-98)
   (C)   Except as provided in §
18.20.060(E) of this title, all payments shall be applied first to pay all

   (D)   To the extent allowed by federal and state law, the city shall hold
and retain and/or may create a lien, maritime or otherwise, against any vessel
for any unpaid feeds or charges the vessel and/or its operator owe the city. If
any such fees and charges remain unpaid and delinquent, the city may, at its
option, enforce and foreclose its lien by suit in rem pursuant to applicable
federal and state law. Such suit shall not preclude the city from pursuing any
other remedy at law or in equity.
§ 18.16.070 PORT AND HARBORS ENTERPRISE FUND.
   The City Treasurer shall maintain an enterprise fund known as the “Port and
Harbors Enterprise Fund.” All fees arising out of operation of the port and

§ 18.20.010 IMPOUNDMENT.
   (A)   The Harbormaster may take immediate possession and/or impound and
remove any vessel within his jurisdiction:
      (1)   To abate derelicts and nuisances;
      (2)   For failure to comply with the registration provisions of this
title;
      (3)   That is obstructing port traffic and the vessel operator is unable,
fails or refuses to immediately attend to and remove the vessel such that it no
longer obstructs port traffic;
      (4)   Whose operator reasonably appears incapable of safely operating the
vessel or appears incapable of directing the disposition of the same;
      (5)   Whose operator refuses to properly identify themselves upon lawful
request of the Harbormaster, or refuses or fails to obey an order of the
Harbormaster to proceed to or from an area following issuance of a citation or
in an emergency;
      (6)   Whose operator operates a vessel in a reckless manner under §
18.20.030, in a negligent manner under §
18.12.040, or in another manner so as to endanger the safety of others or to
unreasonably interfere with the navigation of other vessels, and the
Harbormaster believes such operation would continue unless possession of the
vessel be taken;
      (7)   That is moored in a reserved mooring space assigned to another
after reasonable efforts were made at attempting to contact the vessel operator
to move the vessel in question, or who, after receiving notification to move
the vessel, refuses to do so;
      (8)   That is moored at a loading area or launch ramp area for a period
of time longer than permitted;
      (9)   That is in imminent danger of sinking; or
      (10)   That constitutes a fire hazard to itself, port facilities or other
property.
   (B)   When taking possession or impounding as authorized by this chapter,
the Harbormaster may impound the vessel in place by chaining or otherwise
mooring it to a float or other suitable object, or if practical by removing it
from the water and placing it in either city or commercial land storage.
Vessels not practical to impound by moving, mooring or removing from the water
may be impounded by posting a notice of impoundment in the places set out in §
18.20.030.
   (C)   The Harbormaster may appoint a custodian to maintain and safekeep the
vessel while it remains impounded. In the discretion of the Harbormaster, such
custodian may be the operator of the vessel.
   (D)   Upon impoundment of a vessel, it shall be unlawful for any person:
      (1)   To move, load, unload, rebuild, or enter upon such vessel without
written permission from the Harbormaster, other than for necessary maintenance
and repair to prevent deterioration of the same or sinking; and
      (2)   To remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice or sign posted
by the Harbormaster pursuant to this section.
(Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-26-2021)
§ 18.20.020 EXPENSES.
   (A)   Expenses incurred by the Harbormaster in the removal, towing
impounding, custodianship, moorage and/or storage of any vessel under §
18.20.010 shall be paid by such vessel and its operator.
   (B)   When a vessel or other property is moored or impounded at a port
facility, the Harbormaster shall assess a moorage charge therefor in the amount
to be set by ordinance per day. Such fee, in case of dry land storage, shall be
in addition to the dry land storage fee at the dry land rate and in addition to
the haul out fee.
   (C)   The Harbormaster may decline to release possession of any vessel until
all charges are paid in certified funds.
§ 18.20.030 NOTICE OF IMPOUNDMENT.
   (A)   At least ten days prior to impounding any vessel, the city shall cause
to be posted on the vessel and in five public locations throughout the city a
notice of such action to be taken by the city. A copy of the notice shall be
mailed, by registered or certified mail, to each affected vessel operator at
their address of record and to all other persons known to have an interest in
the vessel, including all lienholders shown on the records of a state or
federal agency.
   (B)   The notice required by this section shall contain the name and/or
number of the vessel; the name and address, if known, of the vessel’s owner and
each operator; and the vessel’s location. The notice shall further state the
grounds upon which the vessel is being impounded, and the proposed disposition
of the vessel. The notice shall further state that any person with a property
interest in the vessel may request a hearing as provided in this chapter.
(Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-26-2021)
§ 18.20.040 HEARING BEFORE IMPOUNDMENT.
   (A)   Any person with a property interest in an impounded vessel may obtain
a prompt hearing before the Port Director before the vessel is impounded to
determine whether there is probable cause to impound the vessel by submitting a
written request for a hearing no later than 10 days after receipt of notice of
impoundment or after the person has learned such vessel will be impounded
whichever comes first.
   (B)   At the hearing, the Port Director shall review whether probable cause
exists for impounding the vessel. "Probable cause to impound" shall mean such a
state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe
that there was a breach of federal, local or municipal law or regulations, or
any agreement entered into pursuant thereto, rendering the vessel subject to
impoundment. Any person with a property interest in the vessel may present
evidence, call witnesses, and present argument as to the impoundment, its
propriety and/or release of the vessel. The city may also present evidence,
call witnesses and present argument in response. If it is determined that
probable cause to impound exists the city may proceed to impound and sell or
destroy the vessel as provided in UCO 18.20.050.
   (C)   At any time prior to sale, the Port Director may release the vessel
from impoundment to the owner or operator of the vessel upon such terms and
conditions as the Port Director in their discretion finds will abate the
nuisance or other cause for impoundment, otherwise remedy the reason for
impoundment, and reimburse and compensate the city for expenses owning pursuant
to §
18.20.020.
   (D)   The written decision of the Port Director is a final administrative
decision when mailed to each party requesting a hearing, and may be appealed
only to the Superior Court. Any appeal must be commenced within 30 days of the
date of mailing of the decision.
(Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-26-2021)
§ 18.20.050 SALE OF IMPOUNDED VESSELS.
   (A)   In the event a vessel remains impounded for 90 days and impound
charges and expenses remain unpaid, the Harbormaster may sell the vessel at
public auction to the highest and best bidder as provided in this section.
   (B)   Not less than 20 days prior to sale, the city shall publish a notice
of sale once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice
shall describe the vessel in general terms; the name and/or number of the
vessel; the name and address of each vessel operator, if known; the location of
the vessel; and the intention of the city to sell the vessel at public auction
on a day and at a time certain for cash to the highest and best bidder.
   (C)   The person whose bid is accepted shall immediately pay the
Harbormaster the full purchase price, if the bid is no more than $5,000; or a
deposit of at least $5,000 or 10% of the bid, whichever sum is greater, if the
bid exceeds $5,000. The bidder shall pay the balance of the purchase price
within three days thereafter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. A
person who fails to pay the balance of a bid within the time required is deemed
to be in default, and the Harbormaster may, in his discretion, give that person
further time to pay the balance, sell to the second highest bidder, or conduct
a new sale, as seems appropriate. Any sum deposited by the bidder in default
shall be forfeited and applied to pay any additional costs incurred by the
Harbormaster by reason of the default, including costs incident to resale. The
balance of the deposit, if any, shall be deposited into the Port Enterprise
Fund. A successful bidder who pays the balance of the bid after the time
required by this subsection, or otherwise takes delivery of the vessel after
the time payment of the full purchase price was due, shall also pay the
Harbormaster the cost of keeping the vessel from the date payment of the
balance was due to the date the bidder takes delivery of the vessel. The
Harbormaster shall refuse to release the vessel until the full purchase price,
plus any costs for keeping the vessel after the time payment of the full
purchase price was due, is paid.
   (D)   After the full purchase price plus any costs are paid by the
successful bidder to the Harbormaster, the city shall make and deliver its bill
of sale, without warranty of title, for the vessel to the successful bidder.
Failure of a party to give or receive required notice of the impoundment, sale
or other action shall not affect the title of the purchaser of the vessel.
   (E)   The proceeds of such sale shall be first applied to the costs of sale,
then to impoundment expenses, then to delinquency charges accrued, then to
moorage and service fees accrued. Any balance remaining shall be held in trust
by the city for the owner of the vessel to claim. If the balance is not claimed
within five years, the balance shall be deposited into the Port Enterprise
Fund.
   (F)   If at any public sale there are no bidders for a vessel, the city may
declare the vessel to be surplus property and sold at a city surplus property
sale, or the vessel may be destroyed, scuttled or otherwise disposed of. Any
disposition under this subsection shall be without liability of the city, the
Harbormaster or any of their employees or agents to the vessel owner, its
operator, or anyone else holding liens, claims or other interests in the
vessel.
§ 18.20.060 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   Upon the Harbormaster's written determination that a condition
described in UCO
18.20.010(A) exists that constitutes a clear and present danger to the public
health, safety or general welfare, the nuisance may be summarily abated by the
Harbormaster without prior notice. The Harbormaster may take immediate
possession and/or impound and remove any nuisance or property creating a
nuisance on port facilities property.
   (B)   All personal property, including but not limited to machinery,
equipment, gear, appliances and furniture, placed or stored on port facilities
property without the express permission of the Harbormaster shall be considered
to be a hazard and a hindrance to the public use of port facilities. Such
property shall be subject to impound if not removed, or written permission from
the Harbormaster for such placement or storage is not received, within 24 hours
of placement on port facilities property.
   (C)   Immediately upon impounding any property, the city shall cause to be
posted on the property and in five public locations throughout the city a
notice of such action. A copy of the notice shall be mailed, by registered or
certified mail, to the person who the Harbormaster determines through the
exercise of due diligence is the owner of the property and to all other persons
known to have an interest in the property.
   (D)   Property impounded under this section shall be subject to an impound
fee to be set by ordinance, plus all costs of impoundment including labor, and
a storage charge to be set by ordinance for each day the property remains in
the Harbormaster’s possession. All impound charges and fees shall be paid in
full and in certified funds, before the Harbormaster may release the impounded
property to its owner.
   (E)   A person with a property interest in impounded property may obtain a
prompt hearing before the Port Director by submitting a written request for a
hearing no later than ten days after receipt of notice of impoundment or
learning of the impoundment whichever is earlier. If following the hearing it
is determined the property was improperly impounded it shall be released to the
property owner.
   (F)   In the event property impounded under this section remains impounded
for 90 days after written notice of impound is issued to the person who the
Harbormaster determines through the exercise of due diligence is the owner of
the property and impound charges and fees remain unpaid, the Harbormaster may
sell the property at public auction to the highest and best bidder. Such sale
shall be conducted pursuant to a procedure generally similar to that set forth
in § 18.20.060 for sale of impounded vessels. If impounded property is without
value, it shall be destroyed and otherwise disposed.
   (G)   Upon impoundment of property, it shall be unlawful for any person:
      (1)   To take, move, or access such property without written permission
from the Harbormaster.
      (2)   To remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice or sign posted
by the Harbormaster pursuant to this section.
(Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-26-2021)
§ 18.20.070 LIABILITY.
   The city and its agents shall not be responsible or otherwise liable for
damages incurred as a result of authorized possession, impoundment and/or sale
of a vessel or other property if all reasonable and safe practices are employed
and all procedures set forth in this chapter are followed.
