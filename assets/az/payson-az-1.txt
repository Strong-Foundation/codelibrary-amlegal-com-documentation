a majority of the votes cast at that election for that office shall be declared
to be elected to the office for which the person is a candidate effective as of
the date of the general election, and no further election shall be held as to

are determined by A.R.S. § 9-821.01(D) (1-3):

candidates for an office whose names were lawfully on the ballot for that
office.

the number of seats to be filled for the office.
         (c)   Dividing the number reached pursuant to division (A)(1)(b) above
by two and rounding that number to the highest whole number.
      (2)   If more candidates receive a majority of votes cast than there are
seats for the offices to be filled, from among those candidates who receive a
majority of votes cast, the candidates who receive the highest number of votes
equal to the number of seats to be filled for the office shall be declared
elected to that office. (A.R.S. § 9-821.01(E))
      (3)   If at the primary election no candidate receives the majority of
votes cast or the number of seats to be filled for the office is more than the
number of candidates who receive a majority of votes cast, of the candidates
who did not receive a majority of votes cast, the number of candidates who

      (4)   If more than one candidate received an equal number of votes and

§ 50.67 CONSERVATION AWARENESS.
   (A)   Restroom and shower facilities. Public, semi-public, and governmental
restroom and shower facilities shall post at least one water conservation sign
in each restroom and shower facility not less than 8 inches by 11 inches. Such
entities may use a town-provided sign or develop their own sign using town-
provided text, the text of which shall cite this subchapter. A PUBLIC FACILITY
shall not include those facilities used solely by the employees of an entity. A
SEMI-PUBLIC FACILITY shall include all private clubs and fraternal
organizations.
   (B)   Lodging guest rooms. Hotels, motels and other lodging facilities shall
provide a water conservation informational card or brochure in a visible
location in each guest room. Such facilities may use town-provided literature
or develop their own using town-provided text. Lodging facilities shall not
provide daily linen and towel changing for those guests staying multiple nights
unless a guest specifically requests each day that the linen and towels be
changed.
   (C)   Nurseries. Retail plant nurseries shall provide their end-use
customers with town-provided low water use landscape literature and water
efficient irrigation guidelines at the time of sale of any outdoor perennial
plants. An END-USE CUSTOMER is the person or persons who will ultimately own
the plant material. A landscape contractor or architect is not an end-use
customer. In order to facilitate the purchasing of low water use plants,
nurseries are strongly encouraged to tag or sign their low water use plants
that require little to no supplemental watering once established. [For the sale
of all turf or grass seed or sod, the end-use customer shall be given town-
provided literature indicating the restrictions to planting water consumptive
turf. The establishment of turf, from either sod or seed or expansion of
existing turf areas, is expressly prohibited.] Signs provided by the retailer
or the town shall be prominently displayed indicating this restriction on turf.
Landscape contractors, maintenance companies, and architects shall provide
their prospective clients with town-provided low water use landscape literature
and water efficient irrigation guidelines at the time of presenting a service
contract to the prospective client. Landscape professionals are strongly
encouraged to educate their customers regarding the operation of their timed

Editor’s note:
   As set forth in Res. 2767, the bracketed portion of division (C) shall be
repealed upon the Water Division Manager indicating to the Council at a public
meeting that water from the C.C. Cragin Reservoir is available for use in the
town’s water system.
§ 50.68 ENFORCEMENT.
   This subchapter may be enforceable through one or more of the following
ways: payment of administrative fees, termination of service and prosecution in
the Payson Magistrate Court.
   (A)   Administrative fees. Customers who violate any provision in this
subchapter may be assessed an administrative fee for each such violation. Such
fees shall be assessed on the customer's water bill. All violations on a single
date at a single customer address shall constitute a single offense and each
day that a violation occurs shall be considered a separate offense under this
subchapter.
      (1)   Amount of administrative fees. The administrative fees shall be as
determined by Council.
      (2)   Right to appeal. Each customer who is assessed an administrative
fee shall have the right to appeal the imposition of such fee by filing a
written notice of appeal with the Water Division within ten calendar days of
receiving the water bill containing the administrative fee. Within ten calendar
days following receipt of such notice of appeal, the Division Manger shall set
a date for hearing the appeal, which shall occur not later than 30 days after
receipt of the written notice of appeal. The customer shall be notified in
writing of the time and place of such hearing and such notification shall be
made to the last billing address of such customer. The appeal shall be informal
and shall be heard by the Division Manager. The Division Manager's decision
shall be final.
   (B)   Termination of service. The town may terminate or suspend water
service to property owned or controlled by a customer in violation of this
subchapter. The Division Manager shall cause a notice of water termination to
be served upon the violating party stating that service will be discontinued in
five calendar days from the day of service unless a hearing is requested. A
hearing may be requested by delivery of a request in writing to the Town
Manager within five calendar days. If a hearing is requested, the Town Manager
shall convene a hearing within three days. The requesting party may appear
before the Town Manager and may present such evidence and reasons such party
may have for not effectuating a termination or suspension of water service and
may bring to the hearing such other persons or evidence as such party may
desire. After hearing, and upon finding that such a violation has occurred, the
Town Manager may order that water service be terminated or suspended pending
compliance with this subchapter.
   (C)   Emergency termination of service. When a violation of this subchapter
occurs, and the Division Manager determines that the specific circumstances of
the violation are of such a serious nature as to require immediate measures and
abatement, the Division Manager may take steps to temporarily shut off the
water source or discontinue the water service to the property where the
violation is occurring. In such cases, the Division Manager shall cause a
notice of water termination to be served upon the violating party at the time
of emergency termination of services. The violating party shall have the right
to appeal such action as provided in division (B) above.

continuous access to water and shelter. The trolley system must be of
appropriate configuration to confine the dog to the owner’s property, to
prevent the tether from extending over any object or an edge that could result
in injury or strangulation of the dog, and to prevent the tether from becoming
tangled with other objects or animals.

single specimens of trees, fire-resistant ornamental shrubbery, and other fire-
resistant planting materials or cultivated ground covers, approved by the Fire
Chief, which do not form a means of rapidly transmitting fire from native or
landscape plants to any improvement or other vegetation. Replanting may be
required for erosion control.

any other provisions of the uniform video services license to the contrary, the
uniform video services license shall at all times comply with all laws and
regulations of the state and federal government or any administrative agencies
thereof. Provided, however, if any such state or federal law or regulations
shall require the licensee to perform any service, or shall permit the licensee
to perform any service, or shall prohibit the licensee from performing any
service, in conflict with the terms of the license or this chapter, then as
soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the licensee shall notify the
Town Attorney of the point of conflict believed to exist between such

§ 116.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is adopted to protect the peace, health, safety, and welfare of
the town's residents and visitors by enacting reasonable regulations that
mitigate the harmful abuses common to the short-term rental of residential
property within the town while preserving property owners' rights to rent their
property in a manner that does not disturb the peace or harm public health,
public safety, or welfare of the general public. Such harmful abuses deplete
law enforcement and public safety resources and can leave other areas of the
town with compromised levels of police protection so as to create a significant
threat to the safety of both citizens and police officers alike. The inclusion
of a specific regulation or reference to the Town Code in this chapter does not
imply the exclusion of any other applicable law. It shall be unlawful to
provide, offer or operate a short-term rental or vacation rental within the
corporate limits of the town without first obtaining a license as provided in
this chapter and without complying with any and all applicable laws,
regulations, and this Code.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT,
PURPOSE AND METHODS, DEFINITIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Arizona has, in A.R.S. § 48-3610, enabled
the town to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3609, designed to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Res. 1579, passed 1-10-02; Am. Ord. 759, passed 4-2-09; Am. Res. 2477, passed
4-2-09; Am. Ord. 889, passed 5-18-17; Am. Res. 3024, passed 5-18-17)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Res. 1579, passed 1-10-02; Am. Ord. 759, passed 4-2-09; Am. Res. 2477, passed
4-2-09; Am. Ord. 889, passed 5-18-17; Am. Res. 3024, passed 5-18-17)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, by adopting regulations, including those required by federal
law relating to flood conditions, and by limiting or prohibiting the use or
division of property for the protection of the public’s health and safety from
flood conditions, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges, located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood-
blight areas;
   (G)   Participate and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and disaster
relief.
(Res. 1579, passed 1-10-02; Am. Ord. 759, passed 4-2-09; Am. Res. 2477, passed
4-2-09; Am. Ord. 889, passed 5-18-17; Am. Res. 3024, passed 5-18-17)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   These regulations take precedence over any conflicting laws, ordinances and
codes that are less restrictive. In order to accomplish its purposes, this
chapter includes methods and provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Res. 1579, passed 1-10-02; Am. Ord. 759, passed 4-2-09; Am. Res. 2477, passed
4-2-09; Am. Ord. 889, passed 5-18-17; Am. Res. 3024, passed 5-18-17)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage,
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE, LOW COST AND SMALL. A structure that is on the same
property as the principal structure.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal

Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), with a 1% or greater annual chance of flooding to an
average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not
exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may
be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. These areas
are designated as Zone A, AO, AE, AO, AH, and Al-30 on the FIRM, and other
areas determined by the criteria adopted by the Director of the Arizona
Department of Water Resources. (See SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.)
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year (also called the “100-year flood”).
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map for Zones AE, AH, Al -30 that indicates the water surface elevation, or the
computed elevation to which flood water is anticipated to rise, resulting from
a flood that has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. Any state or area, or political subdivision thereof, or any
Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization, or authorized native

regulations for the areas within its jurisdiction.
   CUMULATIVE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. The total of all repairs to a repetitive-loss
structure shall not cumulatively increase the market value of the structure by
more than 49% during the life of the structure. This term does not, however,
include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official, and which
are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any repair of flood damage to a “historic structure”, provided the
repair will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic
structure”.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, and storage of
materials and equipment.
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certificate prepared by a registered land surveyor
that provides information concerning the lowest floor elevation or service
equipment of a structure in a special flood hazard area.
   ENCROACHMENT. The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill,
excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain
which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from: (1) the overflow of flood waters;
(2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source; and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake
or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels, or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined herein.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood
hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation
of the base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM. Those physical, structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated and expended, and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding, in order to reduce the extent of
the area within a community subject to a “special flood hazard”, and the extent
of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see FLOOD or FLOODING).
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The town official appointed to administer and
enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN BOARD. The Common Council of the Town of Payson at such times as
they are engaged in the enforcement of this chapter. (“Floodplain Board” as
defined in A.R.S. § 48-3610 for cities and towns.)
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures, and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural
resources in the floodplain, for reducing flood damage, including but not
limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other applications of
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.” (“Floodway” is defined in
A.R.S. § 48-3601 and “regulatory floodway” is defined in 44 CFR Ch. 1 § 59.1.)
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above a flood
level, for purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of
the watershed.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking and port facilities necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities,
but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The Mayor and Common Council of the Town of Payson, Arizona,
which is the local governing unit empowered to adopt and implement regulations
to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HARDSHIP. The exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant
the requested variance. The governing body requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register.

Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district.
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement (see BASEMENT). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other
than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided it
is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter. (This definition is from 44 CFR
Ch. 1 § 59.1)
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built
on a permanent chassis and designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation, when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured
home” does not include a “recreational vehicle” (see RECREATIONAL VEHICLE).
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent.
   MARKET VALUE. Defined in the substantial damage and substantial improvement
procedures.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum
(NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the
“start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   ONE HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (see BASE FLOOD).
   PERSON. An individual or the individual’s agent, firm, partnership,

horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as a
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). An elevation one foot above the base flood
elevation for a watercourse for which the base flood elevation has been
determined, and shall be as determined by the criteria developed by the
Director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources for all other
watercourses.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height. (“Regulatory floodway” is defined in A.R.S. § 48-3601.)
   SHEET FLOW AREA. (See AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.)
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). An area in the floodplain subject to a 1%
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a FHBM or FIRM
as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99 or AH.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
(“Start of construction” is defined in 44 CFR Ch. 1 § 59.1.)
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred
(see CUMULATIVE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE).
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official, and which
are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”. (“Substantial improvement” is defined in 44 CFR Ch. 1 §
59.1. It also meets the standards in A.R.S. § 48-3609.)
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (See Section
3.3.6.2 of Handbook for Arizona Communities on Floodplain Management for
further information regarding violations.)
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988, or other datum where specified, of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

§ 151.11 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The area of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The
Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Payson, Gila County”, dated December 4,
2007, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated December 4, 2007, and all subsequent
amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be
a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and attendant mapping
is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter, and may be supplemented
by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which
are recommended to the Floodplain Board by the Floodplain Administrator. The
Floodplain Board, within its area of jurisdiction, shall delineate (or may by
rule require developers of land to delineate) for areas where development is
ongoing or imminent, and thereafter as development becomes imminent,
floodplains consistent with the criteria developed by FEMA and the Director of
the Arizona Department of Water Resources. The Flood Insurance Study, FIRMs and
FBFMs are on file at 303 North Beeline Highway, Payson, Arizona, in the office
of the Town Engineer.

§ 151.15 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the town, any officer or employee
thereof, the State of Arizona, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any

relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained.
      (2)   Base flood elevation and rate of flow due to physical alterations.
         (a)   Base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from
physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not
later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with 44
CFR § 65.3. Such a submission is necessary so that, upon confirmation of those
physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.
         (b)   Within 120 days after completion of construction of any flood
control protective works which changes the rate of flow during the flood or the
configuration of the floodplain upstream or downstream from or adjacent to the
project, the person or agency responsible for installation of the project shall

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.40 STANDARDS OF CONSTRUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
   (A)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; and
      (2)   All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of §
151.44(B).
   (B)   Construction materials and methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed
new development shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
      (4)   Within Zones AH or AO, require that adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes guide flood waters around and away from proposed or
existing structures.
   (C)   Elevation and floodproofing.
      (1)   Residential construction.
         (a)   Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall

§ 151.46 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.11 are areas designated as floodways. Because the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area, due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following requirements from
44 CFR Ch. 1 § 60.1 and A.R.S. § 48-3609B.4 apply:
   (A)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided, demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of §§
151.40 through
151.46, inclusive.

VARIANCE PROCEDURE
§ 151.50 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the town to help protect its citizens from flooding.
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a
structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter
are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the
variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Res. 1579, passed 1-10-02; Am. Ord. 759, passed 4-2-09; Am. Res. 2477, passed

§ 151.51 APPEAL BOARD.
   (A)   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   In passing upon such applications, the Floodplain Board shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage, and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (C) of this section and
the purposes of this chapter, the Floodplain Board may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice, over the signature of a community official, that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property; and
      (3)   The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for
exchange of land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program
provided by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2. A copy of the notice shall
be recorded in the Office of the Gila County Recorder in a manner so that it
appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.

§ 151.52 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level; provided the procedures of §§
151.30 through
151.46, inclusive, of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration
of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   (C)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (E) Variances shall only be issued upon a:
      (1)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      (3)   Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it
is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only
facilities listed in §
151.05 in the definition of “functionally dependent use”; and
      (4)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   This chapter addresses engineering issues associated with grading and
drainage policies and criteria, grading and drainage design practices and
floodplain management within the town. It is the overall and primary objective
of the town to provide grading and drainage design criteria that serve to
protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the
community, with regards to flooding and drainage issues.
   (B)   This chapter provides general engineering guidelines and is not
intended to be a substitute for sound engineering judgment when dealing with
specific design problems. Specific engineering procedures and methodologies are
not always dictated within this manual, but instead are often cited by
reference to other widely accepted design manuals published by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (COE), Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), Arizona
Department of Water Resources (ADWR), Arizona Department of Environmental
Quality (ADEQ), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and other regulatory
agencies within Arizona. This approach is intended to provide the engineer with
the flexibility to apply engineering methods most appropriate to an individual
project. Other objectives of this chapter include:
      (1)   Minimizing the review time for drainage reports and improvement
plans;
      (2)   Providing the Design Engineer with the town’s grading and drainage
requirements prior to initiating a project; and
      (3)   Providing for drainage infrastructure that is functional, durable
and aesthetic.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.02 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter is to be used by Civil Engineers in preparing drainage reports
for storm water planning, analysis and design and grading plans within the
town. Many procedures that are presented or referenced within this chapter have
a limited range of applicability. An attempt has been made in this chapter to
specify these ranges whenever possible. However, it is the responsibility of
the practicing engineer to utilize sound engineering judgment and experience
when applying any engineering methodology to a particular project. Also, the
appropriate sections of the Unified Development Code (1996) (UDC), latest
revision adopted by the town, shall apply as appropriate and deemed necessary
by the town.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.03 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The town is mandated by A.R.S. §§ 48-3604, 48-3609, 48-3610, and 48-
3613, to adopt and enforce regulations designed to protect the health, safety,
and general welfare of the citizens within the jurisdiction area of the town.
In addition, the State of Arizona Department of Water Resources has established
“State Standards For Floodplain Management in Arizona”, which the town is
required to enforce as a minimum. The current list of these standards is:
   SSA 1-97 Arizona Department of Water Resources Flood Study Technical
Documentation (1997).
   SSA 2-96 Arizona Department of Water Resources Delineation of Riverine
Floodplains and Floodways in Arizona (1996).
   SSA 2-92 Arizona Department of Water Resources Administrative Floodway
Determination for Riverine Floodplains in Arizona (1992).
   SSA 3-94 Arizona Department of Water Resources Floodway Modeling Standards
for Supercritical Flow (1994).
   SSA 4-95 Arizona Department of Water Resources Identification of and
Development within Sheet Flow Areas (1995).
   SSA 5-96 Arizona Department of Water Resources Watercourse System Sediment
Balance (1996).
   SSA 6-96 Arizona Department of Water Resources Development of Individual
Residential Lots Within Floodprone Areas (1996).
   SSA 7-98 Arizona Department of Water Resources Water Course Bank
Stabilization (1998).
   SSA 8-99 Arizona State Standard for Stormwater Detention/Retention (1999).
   (B)   The State of Arizona mandates include minimizing public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. The town has chosen to
regulate areas of special flood hazards, as defined by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA supplies the town with Floodway Maps and Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, which provide flood risk information and other technical
data to be used in administering both floodplain management and insurance
aspects of the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
   (C)   Requirements from both agencies have led to the adoption of the
original Town of Payson Drainage Ordinance, Ordinance No. 87, on 14 February
1980. Subsequent revisions have also been adopted, including Ordinance No. 215
(26 July 1984), Resolution No. 394 (12 August 1984), Resolution No. 395 (23
August 1984), Resolution No. 529 (26 March 1987), and Ordinance No. 292 (26
March 1987). The ordinances require that the Public Works Engineer regulate
activities within the defined 100-year floodplain.
   (D)   The Public Works Engineer for the purpose of enforcing the more
general Floodplain Regulations contained within the Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance has adopted specific regulations. Drainage policies are enumerated
within the “Policies” section of each subchapter contained in this chapter.
Since Floodplain Regulations and Drainage Policies are periodically modified or
amended, the user of this chapter should contact the Public Works Engineer
prior to starting on a new project to obtain any new regulations, as well as
design criteria and ordinance updates.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.04 VARIANCES.
   The Public Works Director may grant a variance from the technical
requirements of this chapter so long as such variance does not violate the
objectives and requirements of §§
152.01 and
152.03. The Public Works Director shall create and the Town Manager shall
approve an administrative policy detailing the process by which a variance may
be requested and the parameters within which such variance may be granted.

SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
§ 152.10 PURPOSE.
   The Public Works Department Engineering Division is responsible for review
and acceptance of all public and private grading and drainage projects. To
facilitate the review process, submittal requirements are provided in this
chapter to guide the Drainage Engineer in preparation of drainage reports, and
documentation of drainage designs. Requirements for grading submittals are
found in §§
152.110 - 152.131. The intent is to provide the Drainage Engineer with the
minimum necessary submittal requirements, in a format that will facilitate both
the preparation and the review process.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.11 POLICIES.
   The following policies apply to drainage studies required to be submitted to
the town for approval. When applicable, exceptions to these policies may be
made in writing at the discretion of the Town Engineering Department under
special conditions.
   (A)   It is the policy of the town that each type of development and
improvement project requires a drainage evaluation. Each drainage evaluation
requires submittal of a report documenting the findings and results of that
evaluation to the Town Engineer for review and possible approval. The submittal
review process is described in §
152.12.
   (B)   There are nine types of drainage report submittals covering different
types of developments defined for the town review process. The types of report
submittals, and the corresponding types of development, are shown in
Table 2.1. A description of each type of report submittal is described in §
152.13.
   (C)   All drainage reports produced for projects within the town shall
reference the Drainage Master Plan for Town of Payson, Gila County, Arizona
(2001) (PDMP), latest revision, and describe how the results of that plan
affect the project in question.
   (D)   The appropriate sections of the UDC, latest revision adopted by the
town, shall apply as appropriate and deemed necessary by the town.
   (E)   The town recommends discussing all proposed drainage submittals with
town staff prior to preparing and submitting a drainage report for review. Any
drainage evaluation submitted to the town for review and possible approval must
be prepared and sealed by a Professional Civil Engineer licensed to practice
within the State of Arizona. The only exception is an individual non-hillside
single family residential lot without modifications to a drainage way.
   (F)   A property owner shall not modify the manner in which or location
where storm water enters or exits the property owner's property without prior
written consent of the adjoining property owner(s) affected by such change and
written approval by the Town Engineer. This includes changing exiting runoff
from sheet flow to concentrated flow.

§ 152.12 REVIEW PROCESS.
   (A)   All subdivisions, re-subdivisions, re-zonings, use permits, or
commercial, industrial or residential developments that are within the
jurisdiction of the town, shall be required to submit drainage reports,
construction drawings/specifications, and as-built information in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter. Two copies of the drainage reports shall
be submitted to the Department of Public Works or as otherwise specified by the
town. Upon receipt of the drainage reports, the town may request the submitter
distribute the reports to other appropriate agencies for review and comment.
Additional copies shall be submitted as requested by the town. All submitted
reports should be cleanly reproduced. Photostat copies of charts, tables,
nomographs, calculations, or other referenced materials should be legible.
Washed-out, blurred, or unreadable portions of the report are unacceptable and
could warrant resubmittal of the report.
   (B)   A pre-application consultation is suggested of all applicants for the
processing steps of the subdivision regulations. The applicant shall consult
with the Public Works Department for general information regarding drainage
criteria, required procedures, possible drainage problems, and specific
submittal requirements.

§ 152.13 DRAINAGE REPORTS.
   (A)   Preliminary Drainage Report. A Preliminary Drainage Report shall be
required for commercial and residential subdivisions, and public works
construction projects. The Preliminary Drainage Report shall be submitted with
the Preliminary Subdivision Plat or with the first plans submitted, and shall
be structured using the following report outline for major headings, and
contain the described information, as a minimum. Sections that are not
appropriate or necessary for the application shall still be included in the
document with a statement that the section was not applicable. This outline
also applies to the Final Drainage Report described in division (B) of this
section. Submittal requirements specific to the Preliminary Drainage Report
will be identified as such.
      (1)   Introduction. This section shall define the purpose of the report,
the location of the project (including location and vicinity maps), a
description of the hydrologic setting, and an overview of the proposed drainage
scheme for the project.
      (2)   Mapping and survey information. This section shall describe the
source and date of field survey control data, and the date and source of
topographic mapping used as a basis for the project. All field survey control
shall be done using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) State Plane

   (C)   Drainage Memorandum.
      (1)   A Drainage Memorandum is a simplified report suitable for
addressing drainage concerns for the development or redevelopment of a single
commercial or industrial lot. If the total contributing watershed is less than
160 acres in area and the 100 year peak discharge is less than 10 cfs, simple
Rational Method calculations may be applied to estimate pre- and post-
development discharges for design of channels, pipes, and other drainage
facilities. Runoff volumes, and detention or retention requirements, shall be
estimated in accordance with the requirements of §§
152.30 -
152.39 and §§
152.60 -
152.62. The memorandum can be in the form of a separate document, or included
on the construction-grading plan. The minimum information to be contained in
the memorandum or on the construction-grading plan is:
         (a)   Drainage area.
         (b)   Pre-development and post-development peak discharges and runoff
volumes.
         (c)   Detention/retention basin design calculations.
         (d)   Detention/retention volume required and provided.
         (e)   Design hydraulic calculations for discharge structures.
         (f)   Critical hydraulic control elevations.
         (g)   100-year 24-hour storm ponding limits.
      (2)   The detention or retention basins are to be clearly identified on
the plan, fully dimensioned with the high water elevation identified, and cross
section views provided as needed for clarity. Any retention basin volume
calculations are to be easily verified using the plan details.
   (D)   Site drainage evaluation. The Public Works Department will perform a
Site Drainage Evaluation at the time an application is made for a residential
building permit or, if no building permit is required, when the grading plan is
submitted. The Public Works Department will review the residential building
site plan for conformance with the town requirements. All drainage and grading
of individual residential lots must be done in accordance with the town
requirements in §§
152.110 -
152.130. The Public Works Department will evaluate all grading and drainage not
related to the foundation of a structure. In general, the following will be
required:
      (1)   All residential grading will be required to have a minimum setback
of two feet from property lines (more may be required depending on the height
of the cut or fill).
      (2)   All fill shall be compacted to a minimum of 90% of maximum dry
density.
      (3)   All fill slopes greater than 2:1 shall be required to have a
licensed civil or geotechnical engineer certify the slope for stability.
      (4)   Fill slopes in excess of 3:1 and cut slopes in excess of 2:1 shall
have appropriate erosion control measures applied, such as riprap or designed
vegetation cover.
      (5)   Existing natural drainages may not be obstructed or relocated
without plans approved by the Public Works Department. The point where such
drainages enter and exit the property must not be changed. Nothing may be done
on the property to significantly change the velocity of flow where storm water
exits the site.
      (6)   As the town requirements are revised periodically, additional
requirements may be imposed.
      (7)   Individual residential lots must have a final inspection of site
grading prior to receiving final inspection approval.
   (E)   Grading and drainage permit. A grading and drainage permit is required
for any commercial, industrial or residential lot where a new structure is to
be constructed or, proposed excavation or embankment exceeds a volume of 50
cubic yards. The Town Grading Permit Assistance Form and an example of a
grading and drainage plan for a residential lot are shown on Figures 2.1
through 2.3 in §
152.18. A Grading and Drainage Plan must accompany every request for a grading
and drainage permit. The following additional submittal requirements are based
on whether the parcel in question has an offsite watershed that drains to the
site that will be affected by the construction:
      (1)   Offsite watershed with Q100 less than 10 cfs: In addition to the
Grading and Drainage Plan, submit substantiation that this requirement is met,
and submit a Drainage Memorandum.
      (2)   Offsite watershed with Q100 greater than 10 cfs: In addition to the
Grading and Drainage Plan, submit a Preliminary Drainage Report in accordance
with division (A) of this section.
   (F)   Floodplain Development Permit.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator is the Public Works Director or their
designee, who shall administer and enforce this regulation. A Floodplain
Development Permit shall be obtained from the Public Works Department prior to
commencing any new structure, proposed addition, alteration or change of any
building, structure, land or other use within a 100-year floodplain, except as
exempted by applicable law. A 100-year floodplain includes any 100-year
floodplain designated and adopted by FEMA, or the flood limits resulting when a
watercourse or contributing watershed has flows greater than 50 cfs during a
100-year storm event, whether for existing or anticipated future conditions.
Refer to §§
152.50 -
152.53 for floodplain management policies.
      (2)   The Public Works Department may place a time limit on the
Floodplain Development Permit and any other conditions or restrictions designed
to reduce or eliminate potential hazards to life or property. As stated by town
ordinance and FEMA regulations, absolutely no construction or fill may be
placed in the regulatory 100-year floodway without meeting the appropriate
requirements of division (G) of this section.
      (3)   The applicant may be required to execute deed restrictions running
with the land or to post performance bonds, assurances or other security to
guarantee the performance of the conditions and restrictions imposed.
      (4)   The applicant shall submit any information the Public Works
Department considers necessary in making determinations required by this
regulation. The applicant may also be required to provide certification by a
Professional Civil Engineer, licensed to practice in the State of Arizona, that
all requirements of the Floodplain Development Permit have been met.
   (G)   FEMA CLOMR, LOMR and PMR.
      (1)   A FEMA CLOMR, LOMB or PMR is required for any change to a FEMA
designated 100-year floodplain or floodway map proposed as part of a
residential or commercial subdivision, or any Public Works Improvement Project.
The three terms are defined as follows:
Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA)            A letter from FEMA
stating that a proposed structure that is not to be elevated by fill would not
be inundated by the base flood if built as proposed.
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)                  A letter from FEMA stating that
an existing structure or parcel of land that has not been elevated by fill
would not be inundated by the base flood.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (CLOMR-F)      A letter from
FEMA stating that a parcel of land or proposed structure that is to be elevated
by fill would not be inundated by the base flood if fill is
                                    placed on the parcel as proposed or the
structure is built as proposed.
Letter of Map Revision
Based on Fill (LOMR-F)                     A letter from FEMA stating that an
existing structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by fill would not
be inundated by the base flood.
      (2)   If, in the opinion of the Public Works Department, a proposed
project will have an effect on a FEMA designated floodplain or floodway, then
the party creating the need for the CLOMR must apply for a CLOMR. A LOMR may
not be applied for without an approved CLOMR and as constructed plans of the
improvements. The applicant must prepare a CLOMR submittal, and subsequently a
LOMR submittal, in conformance with FEMA requirements and ADWR TDN
requirements. The approval and support of the Public Works Department must be
received in writing prior to submittal of the CLOMR or LOMR package to FEMA for
review and possible approval. The applicant is responsible for payment of all
applicable submittal and review fees. FEMA forms and instructions for CLOMR,
LOMR and PMR submittals can be found on the FEMA Internet site at http://
www.fema.gov/mit/tsd/EN_main.htm. The ADWR TDN state standard document can be
found on the ADWR Internet site at: http://www.water.az.gov/publications/
formsnpubs.htm.
   (H)   FEMA CLOMA, LOMA, CLOMR-F, and LOMR-F.
      (1)   A FEMA CLOMA, LOMA, CLOMR-F or LOMR-F is required for removal of a
parcel of land or a structure from a FEMA designated 100-year floodplain. The
four terms are defined as follows:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)                  A letter from FEMA stating that
an existing structure or parcel of land that has not been elevated by fill
would not be inundated by the base flood.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (CLOMR-F)      A letter from
FEMA stating that a parcel of land or proposed structure that is to be elevated
by fill would not be inundated by the base flood if fill is
                                    placed on the parcel as proposed or the
structure is built as proposed.
Letter of Map Revision
Based on Fill (LOMR-F)                     A letter from FEMA stating that an
existing structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by fill would not
be inundated by the base flood.
      (2)   If an applicant desires to remove a parcel of land or a structure
located within the 100-year floodway fringe from the necessity to pay for flood
insurance, then the applicant must obtain either a LOMA or LOMR-F. Neither a
LOMA nor LOMR-F for a new structure may be applied for without an approved
CLOMA or CLOMR-F and a FEMA Elevation Certificate. The applicant must prepare a
CLOMA, LOMA, CLOMR-F, or LOMR-F submittal package in conformance with FEMA
requirements and ADWR TDN requirements. The approval and support of the Public
Works Department must be received in writing prior to submittal to FEMA for

§ 152.14 CONSTRUCTION PLANS.
   (A)   Construction plans approved by the Public Works Engineer are required
prior to commencing construction of proposed drainage improvements. Such plans
shall be prepared and sealed by a Professional Civil Engineer, licensed to
practice in the State of Arizona. The construction plans shall be submitted on
24" x 36" drawings, concurrently with the Final Drainage Report. The Public
Works Engineer prior to issuance of a Grading Permit must approve final
construction plans for the public and private improvements covered by the
plans. Acceptance of the final construction plans by the town is a condition of
issuing the Grading Permit. The plans and specifications for the drainage
improvements will include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Storm drain inlets, outlets and manholes with pertinent elevations,
dimensions, type, and horizontal control indicated.
      (2)   Culverts, end-sections, and inlet/outlet protection, with
dimensions, type, elevations, and horizontal control indicated.
      (3)   Channels, ditches, and swales (including side/rear yard swales)
with lengths, widths, cross- sections, and erosion control (i.e. riprap,
concrete, grout, vegetation) indicated.
      (4)   Check dams, channel drops, erosion-control facilities.
      (5)   Detention/retention pond grading, dikes, embankments, trickle
channels, outlets, inlets, safety barriers, cross-sections and landscaping.
      (6)   Other drainage related structures and facilities (including under-
drains and sump pump lines).

necessary to construct the storm water drainage facility. The accepted Final
Drainage Report shall be included as part of the construction documents for all
facilities affected by the drainage plan.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.15 STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   The 1972 Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly
known as the Clean Water Act, CFR Title 40) prohibit the discharge of any
pollutant to waters of the United States from a point source unless the
discharge is authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
mandates that construction sites and "common plans of development or sale" that
disturb five or more acres of land, must control pollution from storm water
discharges. These activities are typically governed under the NPDES
Construction General Permit. The town is not responsible for identifying or
enforcing any EPA regulations regarding the development of private property. It
is the responsibility of the developer or contractor to follow such
regulations. It shall be the property owner's or contractors responsibility to
ensure that all regulations have been complied with and that all appropriate
permits have been obtained prior to construction. All projects that fall under
these regulations must prepare a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP),
and file a Notice of Intent in accordance with state and federal regulations
prior to commencing construction activities. The time frames and content of the
regulations are subject to change; therefore, the responsible party should stay
informed regarding these regulations. Information regarding preparation of an
SWPPP can be found on ADEQ's Internet site at: http://www.adeq.state.az.us/
environ/water/permits/links.html. It is suggested that the checklist available
on the ADEQ Internet site be used in preparation of an SWPPP. Information on
the EPA regulations can be found on the EPA Internet site at: http://
www.epa.gov/owm/cgp.htm.

§ 152.16 RECORD DRAWINGS.
   (A)   Record drawings for all improvements are to be submitted to and
accepted by the town, prior to final acceptance of the improvements. Record
drawings shall be provided, as a minimum requirement, for the following:
      (1)   As-built volume and critical hydraulic control elevations for
detention/retention basins.
      (2)   Compaction testing results from a certified geotechnical laboratory
for embankments (Min. 95% of maximum dry density).
      (3)   Critical drainage grade breaks that affect design drainage flow
patterns.
      (4)   Critical roadway elevations that control upstream ponding that
affect minimum finished floor elevations established for the development.
   (B)   Certification of the record drawings shall be required as follows:
      (1)   If the record drawings show significant deviations between the
plans and construction improvements, the town may require that a registered
Professional Civil Engineer, licensed to practice in the State of Arizona,
certify that "based on site visitations and to the best of their knowledge,
belief, and opinion, the drainage facilities were constructed in accordance
with the design intent of the accepted Final Drainage Report and Construction
drawings."
      (2)   The town will compare the "certified record drawing" information
with the construction drawings. A "certified record drawing" will be accepted
only if: 1) the "record drawing" information demonstrates that the construction
is in compliance with the design intent; and 2) the "record drawings" are
certified by a registered Professional Civil Engineer, licensed to practice in
the State of Arizona.

§ 152.17 DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Drainage easements can be created by individual property owners and
recorded with Gila County, or dedicated on Minor Land Division Maps or land
subdivision Final Plats. Drainage easements may be dedicated to the public and
maintained by the town if properly approved by the Public Works Engineer and
the Town Council. Drainage easements may also be dedicated to the public, or to
private entities, so long as the private entity, such as a property owner or
Homeowner’s Association, agrees to maintain the easement and accompanying
drainage facilities. Drainage easements so dedicated within the corporate
boundaries of the town and properly recorded with the Gila County Recorder may
not be changed or abandoned without the approval of the Public Works Engineer
and the Town Council.
   (B)   Maintenance of drainage easements accepted by the town shall be
limited to that required for functionality. Maintenance of esthetic features
shall be the responsibility of the property owner. No structures that obstruct
or impede the flow of water within a drainage easement will be allowed by the
town, regardless of who is responsible for maintenance of the easement.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.18 FINAL PLATS.
   The following drainage requirements apply to submittals of all land
subdivision Final Plats within the corporate boundaries of the town:
   (A)   Drainage easements shall be dedicated for the area inundated by flood
waters or subject to erosion, from a 100-year developed condition peak
discharge of 50 cfs or greater, or a flow depth of 1 foot or greater. The
entire easement area shall be treated as a 100-year floodplain, with no
building or obstruction allowed in the easement. The actual size of the
easement may be modified later if, upon later analysis by a Registered
Professional, it can be demonstrated that the 100-year storm runoff can be
accommodated in a smaller area. The easement abandonment process must be
followed to reduce the size of the easement.
   (B)   Tracts may be dedicated for detention/retention basins in
subdivisions, including the entire inundation area, the detention inlet and
outlet structures, and all areas necessary for maintenance of the facility. The
owner(s) shall be solely responsible for the operation, maintenance, and
liability for detention/retention systems. If there is a Homeowner's
Association (HOA) established, then the HOA shall be responsible for the
operation, maintenance, and liability for the detention/retention systems.
   (C)   Areas of “Natural Drainage Conveyance” are defined for the purposes of
the town as natural drainage flow paths having a 100-year developed condition
peak discharge between 5 cfs and 50 cfs or as required by the Public Works
Departments. A line type approved by the Public Works Department shall be shown
on the Final Plat to identify areas of Natural Drainage Conveyance. A drainage
easement is not required for these areas, but is encouraged.
   (D)   The following general notes shall be added to all Final Plats,
modified appropriately to define the maintenance entity.
      (1)   Areas of "Natural Drainage Conveyance" cannot be relocated without
submittal of an individual lot Grading and Drainage Plan, and written approval
from the Public Works Department. Any disturbance that blocks, impedes,
redirects, or accelerates the drainage flow in an area of "Natural Drainage
Conveyance" is prohibited.
      (2)   Drainage easements cannot be changed or relocated without written
approval from the Public Works Department and the Town Council. Any disturbance
that blocks, impedes, redirects, or accelerates the drainage flow in a drainage
easement is prohibited.

HYDROLOGY
§ 152.30 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to present methodologies, acceptable to
the town, for estimating storm water peak discharges, runoff volumes, and
developing synthetic hydrographs for use in the analysis and design of drainage
facilities. The most current version of the Arizona Department of
Transportation Highway Drainage Manual (1993) (ADOT Hydrology Manual) is hereby
adopted for use within the town for guidance when applying the adopted
methodologies. The ADOT Hydrology Manual is available from:

§ 152.31 POLICIES.
   The following policies apply to hydrologic modeling methodology used in
drainage studies submitted to the town. When applicable, exceptions to these
policies may be made in writing at the discretion of the Town Engineer under
special conditions.
   (A)   Peak runoff and volume calculations shall be performed, at a minimum,
for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year return periods, in conjunction with all drainage
reports for private developments and public works projects. The 24-hour
duration storm shall be used for all watersheds modeled using the unit
hydrograph method.
   (B)   Peak runoff and volume calculations shall be performed for both
existing and proposed conditions. Proposed condition peak runoff flow rates for
the 2-, 10- and 100-year 24-hour storms shall not exceed the existing
conditions runoff flow rates for the respective storms. A statement to this
effect must be either in the Final Drainage Report or on the improvement plans.
The hydrologic modeling for the project must demonstrate that this requirement
is met. Refer to §
152.61(A) for the only exception to this policy.
   (C)   It is the policy of the town that increases in runoff volume be
allowed to percolate into the ground as much as possible. This may be
accomplished with either detention basins designed to maximize detention time
for the more frequent storms, in-channel check basins or improvement of on-site
watershed initial abstraction. Soil conditions on the site must be conducive to
percolation. Refer to §§
152.60 - 152.62 for policies regarding detention/retention requirements and
basin times.

   The town will normally accept two methods for hydrology computations, the
Rational Method and the Clark Unit Hydrograph Method. The Rational Method may
be applied to watersheds less than 160 acres in area where detailed hydrograph
operations are not necessary. The Rational Method may be applied by use of hand
computations or appropriate available computerized methods. The Clark Unit
Hydrograph Method or the FLO-2D Method shall be applied for all watersheds
greater than 160 acres in area, unless prior approval of an alternative method
is received in writing from the Public Works Department. The COE HEC-1 Flood
Hydrograph Package (1991) (HEC-1) is the preferred computer program for
application of the Clark Unit Hydrograph Method. Other methods may be used,
with prior written approval from the Public Works Department.

§ 152.33 DRAINAGE MASTER PLAN.
   The town PDMP, prepared by Tetra Tech, Inc. in January 2001, has been
adopted by the town and is incorporated as a working part of this chapter. The
PDMP hydrology models shall be used as a basis for all development projects
within the town wherever practical. The PDMP hydrology models are based on
future condition land-uses. New studies must adjust the land-uses to reflect
existing and proposed conditions for the specific site and contributing
watershed being studied.

§ 152.34 RAINFALL.
   Rainfall parameters for hydrologic modeling shall be derived from the ADOT
Hydrology Manual. Rainfall intensity estimates for use with the Rational Method
shall be taken from the appropriate charts on the NOAA ATLAS 14 web site. Point
precipitation values for hydrologic modeling shall be taken from the
appropriate charts on the NOAA Atlas 14 web site.

§ 152.35 RAINFALL LOSSES FOR THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH METHOD.
   (A)   General.  Rainfall losses are to be estimated in accordance with the
procedures in the ADOT Hydrology Manual. The Green & Ampt infiltration method
is to be used with the Clark Unit Hydrograph Method.
   (B)   Determination of soil texture. The rainfall loss characteristics of
soils for undeveloped land within the town and the contributing watersheds have
been prepared as a part of the PDMP. The results are summarized in
Table 3.2. A soils map and report for the Town of Payson is available from the
Engineering Department. This information is to be used for all unit hydrograph
models prepared for studies within the town. The engineer may use more detailed
information specific to a site with written approval of the Public Works
Department.

§ 152.37 RATIONAL METHOD.
   (A)   Application for peak discharge and runoff volume estimation. The
Rational Method may be utilized for computing peak runoff from small watersheds
for the purpose of designing drainage conveyance facilities and storm water
detention/retention basins. The Rational Method should be applied within the
following limitations:
      (1)   The drainage area should not exceed 160 acres.
      (2)   The minimum time of concentration (Tc) is 5 minutes. The maximum Tc
should not exceed 60 minutes.
      (3)   The watershed should be homogenous (i.e. the watershed should not
consist of two or more land-uses of significantly different character). Lack of
basin homogeneity can lead to errors in estimates of Tc and runoff coefficient
“C”.
      (4)   The watershed should not contain storm water facilities that
require routing and combination of hydrographs.
   (B)   Watersheds that do not meet the criteria in division (A) of this
section should be modeled using the Clark Unit Hydrograph method.
   (C)   A number of variations of the Rational Method are currently in use by
communities throughout the Southwestern United States. These methods vary
mostly in the method used to compute the time of concentration, Tc. It is
required that the Rational Method presented within Chapter 2 of the ADOT
Hydrology Manual be utilized for hydrologic analysis within the town. This
methodology was developed for use within Arizona, and the manual is readily
available. Other Rational Methods may also be acceptable, but must be approved
in writing by the Public Works Engineer prior to use. Refer to §
152.34 for the Payson Intensity-Duration-Frequency (I-D-F) for use with the
Rational Method.
   (D)   Estimation of runoff coefficient, “C”. The runoff coefficient, “C”,
for undeveloped watersheds shall be estimated using Figures 3.2 and 3.3. The
hydrologic soil group (HSG) and an estimate of vegetation cover density for the
area of concern can be obtained using Table 3.2 in combination with the town
soils map. “C” values for developed land uses shall be obtained from Table 3.5.

§ 152.38 CLARK UNIT HYDROGRAPH METHOD.
   The Clark Unit Hydrograph Method shall be used in conjunction with HEC-1 for
all watersheds greater than or equal to 160 acres, for design of detention
basins; and where hydrograph channel or storage routing and combination is
necessary. The Clark Unit Hydrograph method shall be applied in conformance
with the procedures set forth in the ADOT Hydrology Manual.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.39 HYDROGRAPH ROUTING.
   (A)   Channel routing. Hydrograph channel routing shall be done using the
Muskingum-Cunge method using the procedures described in the ADOT Hydrology
Manual. Routing reaches shall be subdivided appropriately when the average
characteristics of a routing reach cannot be simulated using a single cross
section. The number of computation steps for each reach must be optimized so
that the number of steps input matches the number of steps calculated using the
reach travel time computed by HEC- HMS. The kinematic wave method, or other
approved method, may be used for routing hydrographs through storm drains or
other prismatic sections where hydrograph attenuation is not expected. Other
hydrograph channel routing methods may be used if appropriate for the situation
and with prior written approval of the Public Works Department.
   (B)   Storage routing. All hydrograph storage routing shall be done using
the Modified Puls Method as implemented in HEC-1. The operation shall be
controlled using an input stage-storage discharge curve. The low-level outlet
HEC-1 option shall not be used. The engineer shall document the hydraulic
calculations performed to generate the stage-discharge relationship. Hydrograph
storage routing shall be performed where hydrograph attenuation is significant
due to ponding and storage. This example of hydrograph attenuation could be
upstream of a street crossing, through a lake, or for detention basins.

FLOODPLAIN DELINEATION
§ 152.50 PURPOSE.
   This chapter presents policies, criteria and methodologies for delineating
floodplain limits and water- surface elevations to be shown on Subdivision
Plats and Development Plans as well as policies for approving developments
located within the boundaries of regulatory 100-year floodplains, and other
floodplain encroachments. In addition, general guidelines and references are
provided for revising Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.51 POLICIES.
   The following policies relate to required floodplain information to be
provided with subdivision drainage studies submitted to the town for approval.
When applicable, exceptions to these policies may be made at the discretion of
the Public Works Department under special conditions.
   (A)   Floodplain delineation.
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for all submittals to FEMA,
including fees, in the event that the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway
change as a result of the proposed development. All subdivisions and
development located wholly or partially within the FEMA regulated floodplain
are required to show how the proposed development will affect existing
floodplain or floodway boundaries. Development within the 500-year floodplain,
as defined by FEMA, is exempt from this requirement.
      (2)   New subdivisions shall have 100-year floodplain and floodway
delineations prepared using the 100-year 24-hour future condition peak
discharge. If an existing FEMA floodplain delineation exists on the property
proposed for a new development, the floodplain shall be redelineated based on
the 100-year 24-hour future condition peak discharge. Resubmittal to FEMA will
only be required if the intent is to decrease the width of the FEMA 100-year
floodplain.
      (3)   Floodplain or drainage path delineations shall conform to the
following normal size limitations:
         (a)   Detailed delineations: Drainage basin greater than 160 acres in
size.
         (b)   Approximate delineations: Drainage basins between 40 and 160
acres.
         (c)   Drainage path: Drainage basins between 10 and 40 acres.
      (4)   The following items shall be done for those developments that will
be located within a regulatory floodplain:
         (a)   A note on the Final Plat shall be included listing the minimum
recommended finished floor elevations for all lots within the delineated 100
year floodplain. If any portion of the lot within the building envelope is
within the 100 year floodplain, the entire lot is considered to be in the
floodplain.
         (b)   The owner/developer shall have an Arizona Registered Civil
Engineer or Land Surveyor certify the finished-floor elevations of all new
structures located within the FEMA floodplain. In the case of manufactured
homes, all elevations are related to the bottom of the structural frame or the
lowest point of any attached appliances.
      (5)   Both existing FEMA and new floodplain and floodway delineations
shall be clearly shown on Subdivision Plats.
   (B)   Floodplain encroachment. The following policies relate to proposed
encroachments into an existing FEMA regulatory floodplain.
      (1)   Encroachments into the floodplain shall not cause the 100-year
water surface elevation to rise more than one foot in elevation, or exceed the
FEMA regulatory water surface elevation, whichever is less. This allowable rise
in water surface will only be permitted if existing development will not
adversely be affected by the rise in water surface elevation.
      (2)   No encroachments into the regulatory floodway are allowed within
the town.
   (C)   Floodplain and floodway modeling methods. Any software used for
hydrologic and hydraulic floodplain analyses must be approved by FEMA. The
approved FEMA software list can be found at: http://www.fema.gov/MIT/TSD/
EN_modl.htm.

§ 152.52 METHODS FOR ESTIMATING WATER SURFACE PROFILES.
   (A)   General. Water surface profiles may be estimated using normal depth or
backwater modeling methods, as appropriate. Both methods are discussed in the
following sections.
   (B)   Normal depth.
      (1)   If the depth and direction of flow in an open channel are nearly
constant with respect to time and space (i.e. steady, uniform flow conditions),
the flow regime is said to be “normal”. Under such conditions, the hydraulic
characteristics of a channel can be evaluated by using the Manning’s equation,
which is described in such hydraulic texts as Open-Channel Hydraulics, by V.T.
Chow (1959) and the Handbook of Hydraulics, by E.F. Brater and H.W. King
(1982).
      (2)   When delineating natural floodplains using “normal depth”
calculations, it is important to check that the energy grade line slopes
continuously in the downhill direction. The energy grade line is defined as a
line connecting points of known total head or total specific energy, H, as
computed by:
         H = Y + V2/2g (Eqn. 4.1)
   Where:
         H = Total specific energy, in feet.
         Y = Depth of flow, in feet.
         V = Average flow velocity, in feet per second.
         g = Gravitational constant = 32.2 ft/sec2.
      (3)   In those cases where the slope of the energy grade line does not
closely approximate the channel-bed slope, the assumption of uniform flow is
not valid. In such instances, backwater calculations must be performed, rather
than the much simpler analysis based on “normal depth” assumptions.
   (C)   Backwater modeling.
      (1)   If the assumptions of uniform-flow cannot be satisfied, then a
water-surface profile will need to be developed using the Standard Step
Backwater Method. This is especially true if the channel cross-section geometry
changes significantly along the reach being analyzed or there are hydraulic
structures or controls such as culverts, bridges, weirs, and/or flow
contractions/expansions, which affect hydraulic conditions.
      (2)   The basic procedure for performing Standard Step Backwater
calculations is presented in a number of readily available references including
Open-Channel Hydraulics, by V.T. Chow (1959) and Applied Hydraulics in
Engineering, by H. M. Morris and J. M. Wiggert (1972). However, due to the
extensive calculations associated with performing Standard Step Backwater
method, computer programs are usually employed for this purpose. The COE HEC-
2 - Water Surface Profiles (1991) (HEC-2) or the COE HEC-RAS - River Analysis
System (HEC-RAS) (2001) programs are the most widely used and accepted computer
programs in use for this type of analysis. The most current version of the COE
software shall be utilized for computer backwater modeling on projects that are
to be reviewed by the town. Submittals of HEC-2 or HEC-RAS shall include
detailed output files and computer diskettes or CD-ROMs containing input/output
files, in conjunction with summary tables that present pertinent hydraulic
parameters. In addition, cross-section plots for representative cross-sections
and cross-sections at critical locations shall be included within the hydraulic
reports.
      (3)   One advantage of using the Standard Step Method is that if the
computation is started at an assumed elevation that is inaccurate for a given
discharge, the resulting flow profile will converge to the correct flow depths
with each succeeding cross-section evaluated along the reach. Therefore, if a
starting water-surface elevation cannot be established at the beginning of the
reach, an assumed elevation may be established far enough away from the
“starting” cross-section to correct for any initial error.
      (4)   The step computations should proceed in an upstream direction for
subcritical profiles and in the downstream direction for supercritical
profiles. For flow regimes that contain both subcritical and supercritical
flows, the computations should be performed both in the upstream direction and
in the downstream direction and the appropriate water-surface elevations
determined. The subcritical profile shall be used for 100-year floodplain
delineations.

§ 152.53 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY FLOODPLAINS AND FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   General. The following sections describe the FEMA National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) as it relates to FEMA floodplain management within the
town. The following are references to FEMA documents that contain information
pertinent to understanding the NFIP and for requesting revisions to existing
defined FEMA flood hazard zones:
   Appeals, Revisions, and Amendments to Flood Insurance Maps - A Guide for
Community Officials (December, 2009)
   Flood Insurance Study Guidelines and Specifications for Study Contractors
(January, 2007).
   A Unified National Program for Floodplain Management (January, 1994).
   National Flood Insurance Program Website
   (B)   Federal Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
      (1)   In 1968 the U.S. Congress established the NFIP, which enables
property owners within participating communities to purchase flood insurance at
reasonable rates. The flood-hazard areas identified as Special Flood Hazard
Areas (SFHA) have been delineated on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) which
are available from the Public Works Department. These maps depict 100-year
flood boundaries, flood insurance rate zones, and FEMA regulatory flood
elevations, most of which are the result of detailed engineering analyses
performed as part of a Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
      (2)   FIRMS are used by FEMA for establishing flood-insurance rates for
affected structures, and by the FEMA and the town for floodplain management.
All new development within FEMA regulatory floodplains must be reviewed and
approved by the Public Works Department. During the review process the Public
Works Department may require a more detailed analysis than was presented in the
FIS. For smaller developments the FIRMs may be used to establish minimum
finished floor elevations, or other site grade elevations.
   (C)   Map amendments and revisions.
      (1)   Occasionally, because of limitations of the scale at which a NFIP
map was prepared, the floodplain boundaries are not delineated in sufficient
detail to reflect individual structures that are elevated on relatively high
ground, or show small parcels of land that have been filled. Similarly,
floodplain information is subject to change, such as after the construction of
drainage improvements or development of more accurate hydrology methods. Since
FIRMs are subject to change because of a variety of reasons, FEMA has developed
a map modification process designed to keep maps updated with current
information.
      (2)   Information depicted on effective NFIP maps may be changed by a
physical revision of the map, by a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), or by a
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). New map panels may be printed; or, if the
revisions are relatively small, a LOMR/LOMA may be issued that describes the
modifications. Changes to effective FIRMs resulting from the exclusion of
individual structures and undeveloped parcels are described in a LOMA; whereas,
communities having updated data, or having constructed new flood-control
improvements may request a LOMR.
      (3)   The general requirements for technical and scientific data needed
to substantiate a LOMR or LOMA are similar. However, there are procedural
differences that determine the amount of data required, and how the data are to
be submitted. General descriptions of the FIRM modification process are
presented within the FEMA publication entitled Appeals, Revisions, and
Amendments to Flood Insurance Rate Maps: A Guide For Community Officials. More
technical information is included within the FEMA publication entitled Flood
Insurance Study Guidelines and Specifications for Study Contractors. FEMA also
publishes standard forms for presenting technical data for LOMA's and LOMR's.
In addition, all map amendments and revisions proposed within the town are
required to be reviewed and approved by the Arizona Department of Water
Resources (ADWR). The engineer that is engaged in the process of performing map
revisions within the town should contact ADWR to obtain current standards and
criteria for performing such flood studies. If construction is proposed on land
within a SFHA, a Conditional LOMA or LOMR can be obtained, provided that the
proposed structural information meets the established criteria for a standard
LOMA or LOMR. After construction is completed, certified "as-built" information
must be provided to FEMA for the purpose of obtaining a LOMA or LOMR. The
information required for a Conditional LOMA or LOMR is basically the same
information that is required for either a LOMA or LOMR. Property owners and
developers should note that a Conditional LOMA or LOMR only provides a comment
on the proposed plan, and does not amend the map or waive requirements to
purchase flood insurance.
      (4)   FEMA typically charges fees for the review of requests for the
various types of map amendments and revisions. These fees can range from a few
hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the complexity of the request.
Since these fees are modified periodically, engineers engaged in preparing such
requests should contact FEMA to obtain a current fee schedule.

STORMWATER STORAGE
§ 152.60 PURPOSE.
   The following section describes the criteria and policies which are to be
followed for the analysis and design of storm water storage facilities
associated with developments located within the town. The purpose of
implementing storm water storage is to mitigate the impacts of increased flow
peaks that occur as a result of watershed urbanization. The intent of storm
water storage requirements is to maintain post-development peak flows to at or
below of historic peak levels for the full range of storm events, from the 2-
year through the 100-year event. Regardless of the calculation method utilized
to analyze detention facilities, it is necessary to demonstrate that post-
development peak flows are no more than the peak flows at "existing conditions"
levels for the 2-, 10- and 100-year 24-hour storm events. The reason for this
requirement is that the impact of development is normally far more pronounced
for the frequent storms than it is for major storms, such as the 100-year
event. For example, while the developed peak runoff for a 100-year event may be
only 20% higher than the historic runoff, it is common that the 2-year peak
runoff, under developed conditions, may be as much as two to six times larger
than the undeveloped runoff. A facility designed to detain only the 100-year
storm event may be practically ineffectual when functioning under the more
frequent storm events. As a result, facilities must be designed with multi-
frequency outlet structures in order to perform as intended.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02; Am. Res. 2272, passed 5-17-07; Am. Ord. 714, passed
5-17-07; Am. Res. 2871, passed 9-17-15; Am. Ord. 872, passed 9-17-15)
§ 152.61 POLICIES.
   The following policies relate to required stormwater storage information to
be provided with subdivision drainage studies submitted to the town for
approval. When applicable, exceptions to these policies may be made at the
discretion of the Town Engineer under special conditions.
   (A)   General policies.
      (1)   Stormwater detention/retention shall be incorporated within
subdivisions, commercial or industrial developments. The detention/retention
system shall have the effect of ensuring that, at a minimum, post-development
2-, 10- and 100-year 24-hour peak discharges from the development will not
exceed the corresponding pre-development values.
      (2)   The use of rooftops as storage areas for runoff is not an
acceptable method of meeting the detention/retention criteria of the town.
      (3)   Individual lot-storage systems within single-family residential
developments are discouraged.
      (4)   Finished floors of structures shall be a minimum of one foot above
the 100-year water-surface elevation of any adjacent detention/retention basin
(s).
      (5)   No part of any storm water detention/retention facility for a
private development shall be constructed within any public right-of-way.
      (6)   Detention/retention areas within subdivisions shall lie within a
separate tract or easement dedicated for drainage management purposes.
      (7)   The use of dry wells is prohibited for draining detention or
retention basins.
   (B)   Detention policies.
      (1)   The intent of a detention basin is to reduce the storm water peak
flow leaving a site. Detention basins shall be designed to maintain the peak
post-development flows to be at or below the pre-development flows for the 2-,
10- and 100-year 24-hour storms.
      (2)   The only outlet allowed in the bottom one-third by depth of a
detention basin is a two-inch orifice. Above the bottom one third depth, the
orifice shall be designed to restrict the post development flows to no more
than the predevelopment flows for the 2-, 10- and 100-year 24-hour storms. The
actual outlet pipe the orifice supplies shall be a minimum of 18 inches in
diameter unless otherwise approved by the Town Engineer. For the purposes of
this section, the bottom one-third of any detention basin shall not exceed one
foot in depth.
      (3)   Gravity drainage of a detention basin must be used where available.
If gravity drainage is not available, a pump system may be used. If a pump
system is used, it shall conform to the following requirements:
         (a)   The pump system shall be privately owned, operated, and
maintained.
         (b)   The pump system shall be equipped with an automatic control
switch with a vertical float mechanism, or equivalent device to turn on and off
automatically.
         (c)   The pump shall be located in an inlet box or wet well. The wet
well shall be located at the edge of the detention basin where it can be
maintained even if there is water in the detention basin.
         (d)   The wet well shall have a gate or other type of control device
that can restrict the flow into the wet well.
         (e)   The pump discharge flow rate shall meet the requirements of §
152.31(B). Multiple staging of pumps may be required to meet such requirements.
      (4)   On-line detention facilities shall not be permitted on natural
watercourses or watercourses that drain more than 100 acres upstream of the
detention-basin outlet structure, unless written approval to do so is obtained
from the Town Engineer.
      (5)   If a parking lot is used as a detention area, the maximum depth of
ponded water within any parking area shall not exceed one foot for the 100-year
storm. Planning of areas within a parking lot, which accept ponding, should be
such that pedestrian inconvenience is minimized. Deeper areas should be
confined to remote areas of parking lots, whenever possible. All detention
areas shall be permanently signed to notify users of the potential flood risk
in accordance with §
152.101 (B)(4).
      (6)   The minimum longitudinal slope permitted within parking-lot storage
facilities is 0.005 foot per foot, unless concrete valley gutters are provided.
With concrete valley gutters, a minimum longitudinal slope of 0.002 foot per
foot may be permitted.
      (7)   It is desirable that all detention basins be emptied within 36
hours. However, the requirements of this Code may dictate that it will require
more than 36 hours to empty the basin. In that case, the basin shall be emptied
in no more than 72 hours. The drainage report shall indicate how long it will
take to empty each basin.
      (8)   All detention basins shall have a minimum freeboard of 1 foot above
the 100-year 24-hour peak stage in the basin.
      (9)   In addition to meeting the standard detention basin requirements,
underground storm water detention shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   Underground detention shall be designed with adequate access for
inspection and maintenance.
         (b)   Final plats for subdivisions utilizing underground detention
shall (1) state who is responsible for inspection and maintenance of the
underground detention, (2) provide a funding source for such inspection and
maintenance, and (3) have the following note, "The owner shall retain a
registered civil engineer, or other personnel as approved by the Town Engineer,
to provide annual inspections of all detention facilities and provide annual
reports to the Town of Payson Town Engineer."
         (c)   The final improvement plans for all developments utilizing
underground detention shall have the following note on such improvement plans,
"The owner shall retain a registered civil engineer, or other personnel as
approved by the Town Engineer, to provide annual inspections of all detention
facilities and provide annual reports to the Town of Payson Town Engineer."
   (C)   Retention policies.
      (1)   Stormwater retention basins are generally not encouraged within the
town, due to potential problems associated with long-term ponding of storm
water. Retention basins shall be emptied by infiltration. The maximum depth
allowed for a retention basin is one foot unless adequate percolation is
provided.
      (2)   Retention basins shall be designed to reduce the peak discharge
from the 2-, 10-, and 100-year 24-hour storm to no more than the pre-
development peak discharge.
      (3)   Maximum disposal time for storm water runoff for retention
facilities is 36 hours.
      (4)   Retention systems that utilize subsurface disposal of storm water
shall incorporate some form of infiltration enhancement system such as gravel-
filled engineered basin floors or trenches to minimize sealing of the basin
bottom. A soils report, including a site-specific percolation test, shall be
required in order to demonstrate that the basin will drain within the maximum
disposal time of 36 hours. Percolation tests shall be performed in accordance
with State of Arizona, ADEQ, Aquifer Protection Permit Rules, Chapter 9,
Section R18-9-A310. Authority for ADEQ to establish rules in this regard comes
from A.R.S. Title 49, Article 3. Approval of a site-specific percolation rate
by the Town Engineer is discretionary. If the percolation rate is not
acceptable, the basin must be drained by other acceptable means within the
required 36-hour period. An Aquifer Protection Permit may be required by ADEQ
for disposal of storm water using retention basins.
   (D)   Points of compliance.
      (1)   The initial point of compliance for the reduction of storm water
flows shall be at all locations where flows exit the development site.
      (2)   Additional points of compliance downstream from the development
property may be required by the Town Engineer.
      (3)   Post-development sheet storm water flows leaving a development
shall not exceed the pre-development storm water sheet flows.
   (E)   Maintenance policies.
      (1)   A maintenance plan shall be prepared in conjunction with the
detention/retention basin design that includes both scheduled and unscheduled
maintenance activities and who is responsible for such maintenance. Scheduled
maintenance includes such items as mowing, pruning, and trash removal that are
to be performed on at least an annual basis. Unscheduled maintenance includes
repairs, usually made necessary by storms and floods, which are discovered
either during regularly scheduled annual inspections, or during inspections
made after flooding. The maintenance plan shall be approved by the Town
Engineer prior to approval of the final improvement plans. The owner of the
detention/retention basin shall maintain records of inspections and maintenance
and provide them to the town when requested.
      (2)   Maintenance ramps or other access shall be provided into detention/
retention facilities in order to facilitate scheduled and unscheduled
maintenance activities. Access easements shall be provided to all detention/
retention facilities.
      (3)   Maintenance of local detention/retention facilities, provided in
conjunction with new developments, shall be the responsibility of the private
property owner or HOA. The town shall reserve the authority to periodically
inspect privately owned detention/retention basins to ensure satisfactory
maintenance is being provided. If the town identifies deficiencies that will
affect the intended operation of the facility, the town will provide written
notification by registered mail of such deficiencies to the responsible party
and/or property owner. The maintenance entity will be given 30 calendar days
from the date of receipt of written notification to correct the deficiencies. A
variance to the 30-day repair period may be granted at the discretion of the
Town Engineer based on progress or extenuating circumstances. Violations are
subject to the penalties described in §
152.999.
      (4)   Final Plats, Development Plans and CC&R's shall have notes stating:
         (a)   Who shall be responsible for the operation, maintenance, and
liability for detention/retention systems.
         (b)   The town may periodically inspect the detention/retention
facilities to verify that scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities are
being performed adequately.
   (F)   Variances.
      (1)   A variance or variances to one or more of the requirements of this
section may be granted upon a showing that both:
         (a)   On-site detention results in an increase in peak discharge at
locations in the watershed downstream of the proposed project due to timing of
peak discharges. There must be sufficient hydraulic capacity in the downstream
drainage conveyance system to convey the proposed condition 100-year peak
discharge to the town corporate boundary without damaging homes or property,
either within or outside the town. The proposed condition peak discharges may
not result in any increase in the future condition peak discharges listed in
the PDMP; and
         (b)   The quality of the storm water runoff will not reduce the
quality of any downstream waters.
      (2)   The Town Engineer may grant a variance to one or more of the
requirements of this section if the developer provides downstream drainage
improvements such that:
         (a)   The existing flows are directed into a channel or storm drain
that has adequate capacity to handle the flows, and
         (b)   There is a downstream location that can be improved to enhance
existing downstream drainage facilities and neighborhoods, and
         (c)   The quality of the storm water runoff will not reduce the
quality of any downstream waters.
      (3)   Any variance requested pursuant to this subsection, must be
requested in writing. If the Town Engineer approves such variance, such
approval shall be in writing.
      (4)   If a variance is granted, the Town Engineer may assess the
developer a fee equal to the estimated cost of constructing the on-site
detention facilities. This fee will be deposited with the town prior to
issuance of a grading permit. The fee will be placed in an impound account and
used for future construction of regional detention or drainage conveyance
facilities. The total amount of the fee will be based on the difference between
the post-development and pre-development runoff volume for the site from a 100-
year 24-hour storm. A standard fee based on dollars per acre-foot of excess
runoff volume will be set by the Town Engineer, and revised on an annual basis.

§ 152.62 DESIGN PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Hydrology.
      (1)   Peak flow values and inflow hydrographs used for the analysis and
design of detention basins shall be determined using the methodology specified
within §§
152.30 -
152.39. For purposes of detention basin analysis and design, inflow/outflow
peak flow values and hydrographs shall be evaluated for the 2-, 10- and 100-
year 24-hour storm return periods.
      (2)   When preparing plans utilizing on-site detention, the engineer
should consider the impact of the retarded peak flow rates on flows from upper
portions of larger drainage basins. That is, the analysis should evaluate how
the detained runoff will impact the overall basin discharge rate. Cases may be
encountered where on-site detention facilities would actually increase the peak
discharge in the receiving stream or would have no beneficial affect. When such
cases are encountered, the hydrological analysis should be included together
with a request that the on-site detention be waived due to its potential
detrimental effect on the receiving stream.
   (B)   On-line detention basins.
      (1)   An on-line detention basin intercepts all runoff from the upstream
watershed and routes it through an outlet structure in a reduced or metered
manner. This is a common type of basin that is typically used to regulate flows
from on-site watersheds associated with new development. On-line basins are not
recommended on natural alluvial watercourses that convey significant amounts of
sediment.
      (2)   The outflow hydrograph and the basin volume requirements associated
with an on-line detention shall be determined using the Modified Puls reservoir
routing method. Commercially available software packages that perform basin
routing, other than HEC-1, may also be acceptable for use in the town, if
written approval is received from the Public Works Department. Figure 5-
1 provides an illustration of the typical hydrograph performance of an on-line
basin. Detailed, step-by-step descriptions for these procedures are presented
in a number of readily available publications including:
   Handbook of Applied Hydrology (1964) by V.T. Chow.
   Soil Conservation Service, National Engineering Handbook, Section 4-
Hydrology (Latest release).
   Pima County/City of Tucson Stormwater Detention/Retention Manual (1987).
   Hydrologic and Hydraulic Training Session Manual (1973) by the Arizona
Department of Transportation.
      (3)   These methods of flood routing assume invariable discharge-storage
relationships and level water-surface elevations within the storage reservoir.
While these assumptions are adequate for most detention basin routing, these
methods should generally not be used for most channel routing applications.
   (C)   Off-line detention basins.
      (1)   An off-line detention basin only captures a portion of runoff,
allowing a certain volume to flow past the basin. After the flow event has
passed, a "bleeder drain" is generally used to dispose of the stored storm
water. Off-line basins generally require significantly less storage volume than
on-line basins, but can be more costly to construct because of the structural
appurtenances necessary to control the quantities of "capture flow" and "bypass
flow".
      (2)   Reservoir routing is generally not required for a single purpose
off-line basin. The basin size is typically determined by the volume of storm
water contained within the hydrograph located above the design "bypass flow"
(Figure 5.1). Reservoir routing is required where the basin drain pipe flow
rate has a significant impact on downstream flow rates or when the basin has
the combined function of an on-line basin for other smaller watersheds.
   (D)   On-line retention basins. An on-line retention basin intercepts all
flow from the upstream watershed but is not provided with a gravity outlet
structure. Typically the basin is designed to permit overflow at the point on
the receding limb of the hydrograph that corresponds with the design outflow.
The retained flow is then disposed of through infiltration or pumping. Use of
this type of basin is typically limited to those situations where a
conventional detention basin outlet structure will not function due to lack of
grade. On-line retention basins are provided with storage volume equal to the
total volume under the 100-year runoff hydrograph that corresponds to the point
on the receding limb of the hydrograph that corresponds to the design outflow
(Figure 5.1). For watersheds less than 160 acres in area, the Rational Method
may be used. For watersheds greater than 160 acres in area, the Clark Unit
Hydrograph method shall be used, in conjunction with the 100-year 24-hour
storm. The minimum required storage volume is the post-development runoff
storage volume from a 10-year 24-hour storm. The minimum volume is calculated
using equation 5.1:
      V = C*A*P10/12 (Eqn. 5.1)
Where:
      P10 = 10-year 24-hour rainfall value, in inches from Table 3.1.
      A = Watershed area in acres.
      C = Rational Method Runoff coefficient.
      V = Runoff volume, in acre-feet.
   (E)   Outlet structures.
      (1)   Because the town requires attenuation of the 2-, 10- and 100-year
peak flows, multifrequency outlet structures may be necessary in the design of
many on-line storm water detention facilities. There are no standardized
procedures for the design of optimum multi-frequency outlet structures. The
potential combinations of suitable outlets for any particular basin are
numerous, and limited only by the creativity and experience of the engineer.
Conceptual examples of typical multi-frequency outlet structures are shown on
Figure 5.2. Additionally, the engineer is referred to a publication entitled
Stormwater Detention Outlet Control Structures, by the American Society of
Civil Engineers. This publication provides other information related to the
design and construction of multi-frequency outlet structures.
      (2)   The minimum allowable pipe diameter for outlet structures is 18
inches. However, orifice plates with smaller openings may be attached at the
pipe inlet to further reduce the flow capacity of a pipe. Trash racks may be
required for pipe and orifice outlets that are 24 inches or less in diameter
and for pipe outlets where water borne debris is expected to be present. Trash
racks shall be designed to be removable, and have a surface area of at least 10
square feet. Openings in the trash rack should not exceed one-half the area of
the outlet pipe for mesh screens, or one-third the diameter of the outlet for
bar screens. Design of the trash rack should consider the likelihood that
unclogging may be necessary when the basin is filled with water. Additionally,
a concrete pad is required around the inlet in order to facilitate maintenance
of the trash rack.

      Figure 5.1: Hydrograph Performance for Various Basin Types
   (F)   Safety guidelines.
      (1)   Basin side-slopes and depths. The following slope/depth ratios are
required for multi-use basins and basins that have unrestricted access:
         (a)   A maximum of 2:1 for protected side-slopes and a maximum water
depth of two feet, and a maximum of 3:1 for unprotected side-slopes where
depths of ponding are less than three feet.
         (b)   A maximum of 4:1 for side-slopes where depths of ponding are
three feet or greater.
      (2)   Benches. A benched slope configuration is required for basins in
excess of six feet deep. Benches within basins shall be proportioned so the
bench width is at least three times the height of the slope above it, measured
from the lowest point on the top of the slope above the bench. The minimum
width of a bench shall be six feet. The maximum number of benches allowed is
three. The maximum depth to the first bench, and subsequent benches, shall
conform to the previous slope/depth ratios.
      (3)   Security barriers. Basins designed in accordance with the
previously listed requirements should preclude the need for security barriers.
However, detention basin design should always consider safety aspects of the
facility. In the following instances security barriers are required. These
barriers may consist of vegetation, masonry, wood, or chain-link. Vegetation,
or a combination of vegetation and structural materials, is preferred.
         (a)   Security barriers shall be provided to prevent access for all
basins where depths of ponding exceed three feet.
         (b)   Vegetative barriers must be of a width equal to or greater than
overall height, with a density sufficient to restrict access. If vegetative
screening is to be used, plant materials must be in place and established at
the time the occupancy permit is requested.
         (c)   A minimum 42-inch barrier height is required.
         (d)   Detailed sections of proposed fences, if required, are to be
shown on paving and grading plans or development plans, as appropriate.
         (e)   Security barriers, if required, shall not restrict the hydraulic
capacity of structures.
      (4)   State of Arizona dam safety requirements. The Arizona Department of
Water Resources (ADWR), Division of Safety of Dams, has legal jurisdiction over
all dams (embankments) which exceed certain height and storage limits. A
"jurisdictional dam" as defined by ADWR, is "...either 25 feet or more in
height or stores more than 50 acre-feet. If it is less than six feet in height,
regardless of storage capacity or does not store more than 15 acre feet
regardless of height, it is not jurisdictional." The ADWR should be contacted
regarding specific dam-safety requirements in conjunction with the design of
any embankment that might come under their jurisdiction. Record Drawings shall
be submitted in accordance with §
152.16.
      (5)   Emergency spillway requirements.
         (a)   Emergency spillways shall be provided for all stormwater storage
basins. For basins with all of the design storage volume situated below
existing grade (i.e. without a berm/dam), the spillway may be nothing more than
grading to ensure that basin overflows will follow the downstream
predevelopment drainage pattern in a safe manner.
         (b)   Emergency spillways shall be designed to safely convey the peak
discharge from the storm listed in the table below entitled Emergency Spillway
Design Capacity Requirements, exclusive of the attenuation effects of the
basin.
   Emergency Spillway Design Capacity Requirements
 
   For An Embankment Berm/Dam That Is Not Regulated by ADWR
   Berm/Dam Heigh   Spillway Design Capacity
H < 6 ft.           Unattenuated 100-year Inflow
6 ft. H < 25 ft.    1/2 Probable Maximum Flood
* Where berm/dam height is the vertical distance from the lowest point along
the downstream slope to the crest of the emergency spillway.
1.   100-year inflow is the unattenuated peak discharge from the pre- or post-
development 100-year or six hour or 24 hour storm, whichever is larger.
2.   Refer to §
152.62(F)(4) for information regarding dams regulated by ADWR.
         (c)   Emergency spillways shall be designed to convey the design peak
discharge and provide erosion protection.
         (d)   Down-gradient properties are to be protected from flow depths
and velocities in excess of pre-development conditions.
         (e)   A one foot minimum freeboard is required between the berm crest
and the water surface elevation of the peak discharge in the emergency spillway
(without attenuation from basin storage), except where the berm crest is
designed to function as the emergency spillway.
         (f)   The finished floor elevation of adjacent structures shall be at
least one foot above the peak water surface elevation of the flow passing
through the emergency spillway.

OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN
§ 152.70 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to (1) provide minimum requirements for the
analysis and design of constructed open channels, (2) discuss several optional
methods of providing stabilization for channel banks and, (3) provide technical
design considerations and criteria for the analysis and design of open
channels.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.71 POLICIES.
   (A)   Under most circumstances, channels designed and constructed in
conjunction with new developments will be owned and maintained by the
developer, HOA or individual property owner, unless they are within the town
right-of-way.
   (B)   Channel improvements must conform to town design specifications
whether or not the facilities are to be dedicated to the town for operation and
maintenance.
   (C)   For constructed channels, the 100-year peak discharge shall be
contained in a defined channel cross-section that includes a minimum freeboard
per §
152.73(D).
   (D)   Drainage channels may not be constructed adjacent to roadways or
within the town right-of-way without prior written permission from the Public
Works Engineer.
   (E)   Unless flow leaving a site is entering a constructed drainageway, the
flow must be returned, as nearly as feasible, to the pre-development condition
(i.e. depth, velocity and width).
   (F)   Constructed channels shall follow the existing watercourse alignment
as closely as is feasible.
   (G)   Where the expected velocity, depth of flow, or channel geometry would
result in scour in an earthen channel, an appropriate type of channel
stabilization shall be required.
   (H)   No valves, closures, transformers, standpipes, poles or other
obstructions will be permitted in any surface drainage channel or roadside
ditch.
   (I)   Channels shall not be designed with a Froude number greater than 0.86
for 100-year peak flow rates in excess of 50 cfs without special design
consideration for the effects of inertial forces, and written approval from the
Public Works Engineer.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.72 CHANNEL STABILIZATION METHODS.
   (A)   General. Channel stabilization is used to control the horizontal and/
or vertical alignment of a watercourse, whether natural or constructed. The
purpose of channel stabilization is to reduce flood hazards, erosion hazards
and maintenance costs associated with the drainage of natural or urban runoff.
Channel stabilization is generally required when flow velocities and soils
conditions result in the potential for bank erosion. Guidance on permissible
velocities for channels with erodible linings can be found in Design Charts for
Open Channel Flow (1961), U.S. Department of Transportation. Some form of
channel stabilization will generally be required in conjunction with new
channel construction unless an analysis is performed, as described in §§
152.80 -
152.83, that demonstrates an erosion hazard does not exist along the subject
reach. A variety of stabilization methods are acceptable within their range of
applicability. Stabilization methods, which have been found to be acceptable,
include those described within divisions (B) - (H) of this section.
   (B)   Rock riprap. Rock riprap stabilization consists of either dumped rock,
or rock held in place with wire mesh and rail piles. Rock may be placed on the
banks only or on the bed and banks as the channel conditions dictate. Rock
riprap is acceptable for use within the town if designed in accordance with the
procedures presented within this chapter. Methods of riprap design other than
the one presented herein may also be used, provided written approval is
obtained from the Public Works Department.
      (1)   Riprap sizing.
         (a)   The chart provided on Figure 6.1 provides the median size of
riprap, D50 for the average flow velocity with the riprap in place. A family of
curves on Figure 6.1 is provided for channels with various curvatures. The
angle of curvature specified on Figure 6.1 is defined as the angle made by the
intersection of the centerline of the straight channel with a tangent to the
outside bend (Figure 6.2). The chart provided on Figure 6.1 was developed under
the assumption that the specific weight of the rock is 165 pounds per cubic
foot. If rock of a substantially different specific weight is to be used, the
D50 should be adjusted by use of Equation 6.1:
         kr = 102.96k/(wr - 62.4) (Eqn. 6.1)
   Where:
         k = D50 from Figure 6.1, in feet.
         kr= D50 for rock to be used, in feet.
         wr= Unit weight of rock to be used, in pounds per cubic foot.
         (b)   Figure 6.1 is also based on the assumption that riprap will be
placed on channel banks having side-slopes no steeper than 3:1. Dumped rock
riprap is not permitted as a method of bank protection on side-slopes steeper
than 3:1 unless an approved engineering analysis is performed which
demonstrates the stability of the steeper slope. Generally, if side-slopes
steeper than 3:1 are required for rock bank protection, then the rock must be
held in place with wire mesh, gabion baskets or grout.
      (2)   Riprap gradation, thickness, and rock shape.
         (a)   The gradation of rock riprap should follow a smooth curve. The
ratio of the largest size rock to D50 should be about two, and the ratio of D20
to D50 should be about one-half. The riprap blanket shall have a minimum
thickness of 2.0D50. Table 6.1 provides a recommended design gradation for
riprap.
         (b)   The shape of the riprap rock should be "blocky" rather than
elongated. More nearly cubical rocks "nest" together, and are more resistant to
movement. Also, rocks with clean, sharp edges and relatively flat faces will
form a riprap mass having an angle of internal friction greater than round
stones, and will be less susceptible to slope failure. The use of river-run
rock may acceptable for riprap. However, the Town Engineer may require that
river-run rock be grouted in place.
   Table 6.1: Riprap Gradation Chart
   (From USDOT, FHWA, HEC-11, 1989)
 
Stone Size Range    Stone Weight Range  Percent of Gradation
1.5 d 50 to 1.7 d50 3.0 W50 to 5.0 W50  100
1.2 d50 to 1.4 d50  2.0 W50 to 2.75 W50 85
1.0 d50 to 1.15 d50 1.0 W50 to 1.5 W50  50
0.4 d50 to 0.6 d50  0.1 W50 to 0.2 W50  15
 
      (3)   Riprap filters. Filters are generally required underneath rock
riprap to prevent the material from being leached out through the riprap. Two
types of filter materials are commonly used: gravel filters and fabric filters.
Gravel filters consist of a layer of well-graded sands and gravel. Generally
the thickness of a gravel filter should not be less than nine inches. Fabric
filters are more commonly used, generally are very effective and easier to
install than gravel filters, although care must be exercised in placing large
rocks on the fabrics to prevent damage to the fabric. Filter fabric use shall
be designed in conformance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

   Figure 6.2
   (C)   Concrete. Concrete lined channels, reinforced with rebar or wire mesh,
are often used when flow velocities are high, or when there is limited width
for the construction of a channel. Concrete lining of the entire channel (i.e.
banks and bottom) is usually required for very high flow velocity and steep
channel gradients. However, an earthen bottom and concrete-lined banks, with
bank toe-downs and, in some instances, periodic grade-control structures are
also practical in certain locations. Toe-downs refer to the vertical distance
that the bank protection extends below the invert of the channel. Concrete or
"shotcrete" channel lining without some form of rebar or mesh reinforcement is
not permitted by the town. The minimum thickness for concrete lined channels is
six inches, measured perpendicular to the face of the lining.
   (D)   Gabion baskets and mattresses. Gabion baskets and mattresses are
specially designed wire mesh containers for rock riprap stabilization. Gabions
are generally used when adequate rock size or gradation is unavailable for
ordinary dumped riprap. Additionally, gabion structures can be constructed on
steeper slopes than dumped riprap, and will therefore require less right-of-
way. In general, the minimum thickness of a gabion basket should equal two-
thirds of the D50 rock size determined from Figure 6.1. Additionally, an
adequate gravel or fabric filter should always be installed with gabions. The
maximum allowable side slope for construction of gabions is 2H:1V.
   (E)   Grouted rock. Grouted rock provides another bank stabilization option
when adequate rock size or gradation is unavailable for dumped riprap. Grouted
rock may be placed on slopes as steep as 1:1 provided the underlying soils have
adequate strength. During construction of grouted rock bank protection, it is
important that the grout is applied in a manner that ensures grout penetration
to the bottom of the riprap blanket. The minimum thickness of grouted-rock bank
stabilization shall be equal to two-thirds of the D50 rock size determined from
Figure 6.1. The rock shall be free of fines that prevent full penetration of
grout.
   (F)   Articulated revetment units. Articulated revetment units (ARU's) are a
stabilization material that is composed of a system of interlocking concrete
blocks that may be used to line drainageways. ARU's have limited application in
this area, and are used primarily on small watercourses that have very flat
side-slopes and very low velocities of flow. Certain manufacturers are
producing ARU's that are suitable for larger watercourses. These particular
products have the advantage of allowing vegetation to grow through the ARU mat.
However, in many cases, cost is a limiting factor in utilizing these products.
The design engineer should consult the manufacturer's design specifications in
order to evaluate the suitability of using a particular ARU on a project.
   (G)   Soil cement. Soil cement, also termed Cement Stabilized Alluvium
(CSA), is primarily used as channel bank stabilization on large alluvial
watercourses in Arizona and elsewhere. It may also be used to line channel
bottoms, as well as for use in the construction of larger scale grade-control
structures, collector dikes, and spillways. Soil-cement bank stabilization is
normally placed on 1:1 slopes, and consists of 6 to 8-inch vertical lifts, 8 to
10 feet in width, placed horizontally in a stair-step manner in order to attain
the desired height of channel bank. Soil cement can also be placed on 3:1 (or
flatter) slopes, at a minimum thickness of 8 to 12 inches where a lesser level
of protection is acceptable. This latter technique is often termed soil-cement
"slope paving". Soil cement design applications shall consider the effects of
freeze-thaw cycles.
   (H)   Erosion control mats and vegetation lining. Erosion control mats may
be used for bank and bed stabilization where appropriate. Biodegradable matting
shall be used to establish grass-lined channels that do not require permanent
mats. Permanent erosion control mats are allowable where design conditions
warrant their use, and provided the manufacturers design guidelines are
followed.

9-17-15)
§ 152.73 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS.
   (A)   General. The design of drainage channels can involve highly complex
hydraulic analysis techniques and considerations. The existence of transitions,
culverts, channel curves, changes in flow regime, etc., can produce hydraulic
conditions significantly different from those determined from steady, uniform-
flow analyses. This chapter provides certain considerations that are commonly
encountered in open channel analysis and design. However the design engineer is
referred to the following publications for detailed presentation of these and
other procedures and considerations associated with the design of open channel
facilities:
   Hydraulic Design of Flood Control Channel (1970), U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.
   Design Manual - Hydraulic (1982), Los Angeles County Flood Control District.
   Design of Small Canal Structures (1978), U.S. Department of the Interior,
Bureau of Reclamation.
   (B)   Channel geometry.
      (1)   Open drainage channels shall be designed using trapezoidal,
rectangular, or compound cross sections, unless prior written approval of an
alternate design is provided from the Public Works Engineer. Side slopes for
constructed earthen or dumped riprap channels shall be no steeper than 3:1,
unless an approved soil analysis demonstrates that steeper side slopes are
stable. Side slopes for lined channels may be steeper, depending upon the
structural stability of the lining and the underlying soils. Reinforced
concrete linings may have vertical side slopes, provided that the design is
adequate to prevent failure from hydrostatic or earth pressures. Shotcrete may
be placed on side slopes as steep as 1:1, provided this slope is not
significantly steeper than the natural angle of repose of the soil. Soil cement
lining may be placed on 1:1 side slopes, provided it is of sufficient thickness
to be structurally stable. The minimum thickness of soil cement on a 1:1 side
slope should be four feet, measured normal to its face. Where soil cement is
used as slope paving, with a maximum thickness of one foot, the maximum
allowable side slope should be 3:1.
      (2)   In the case where a channel outside of public right-of-way will be
accepted for maintenance by the town, a minimum bottom width of 10 feet is
required, and an access road, along at least one side of the channel bank,
having a minimum width of 12 feet. Exceptions to the minimum requirements for
public drainageways may be permitted if deemed appropriate by the Public Works
Engineer. Privately maintained channels have no minimum bottom width, except as
dictated by hydraulic considerations.
   (C)   Flow regime. Flow regime in an open channel can be either subcritical
(tranquil) or supercritical (rapid). The Froude number for subcritical flow is
less than 1.0 and the Froude number for supercritical flow is greater than 1.0.
Critical flow is defined as having a Froude number of 1.0. Flow that is in the
proximity of critical depth is generally unstable and excessive wave action or
undulations of the water surface may occur. For this reason channel designs
should avoid flow regimes that have Froude numbers in the range of 0.86 to
1.13.
   (D)   Freeboard.
      (1)   Freeboard is the additional depth required in a channel beyond the
depth calculated for conveyance of the design discharge. The purpose of
freeboard is to protect against hydraulic disturbances such as waves,
unforeseen obstructions to flow, debris and inherent inaccuracies in
assumptions and analyses techniques. Following are the minimum freeboard
requirements for open channels, with a minimum freeboard of one foot for design
depths of flow of three feet or more:
   Subcritical Flow (i.e. Froude number < 0.86): Minimum Freeboard = 1.0 feet
   Supercritical Flow (i.e. Froude number > 0.86): Minimum freeboard calculated
from Equation 6.3. If the calculated minimum freeboard is less than one foot
and the flow depth is three feet or greater the minimum freeboard shall be one
foot.
      FB = 1/6(y + v2/2g) (Eqn. 6.3)
   Where:
      FB = Freeboard, in feet
      y = Maximum depth of flow, in feet
      v = Average velocity of flow, in feet per second
      g = Gravitational constant = 32.2 ft./sec
      (2)   The freeboard requirements described above are for uniform channel
reaches where no unusual flow disturbances are anticipated. Additional
freeboard is required at channel bends and junctions, where backwater effects
or superelevation may occur, or where hydraulic jumps may occur. The engineer
should consult the references provided at the beginning of this chapter for
computing hydraulic conditions at such locations. The lining of protected
channels shall extend to a height necessary to include the freeboard
requirement, unless approval to the contrary is granted in writing from the
Public Works Engineer.
   (E)   Hydraulic jump.
      (1)   A hydraulic jump occurs when flow changes from supercritical flow
to subcritical flow. Hydraulic jumps can occur:
         (a)   When the slope of the channel changes from steep to mild;
         (b)   At sudden expansions or contractions in the channel section;
         (c)   At culverts or bridges in steep channels;
         (d)   At the downstream side of dip crossings;
         (e)   At channel junctions; and,
         (f)   Sharp bends.
      (2)   Hydraulic jumps are useful in dissipating energy, and consequently
they are often purposely forced to occur at drainageway outlet structures in
order to minimize hydraulic forces and erosion. However, because of the large
amount of energy dissipated in hydraulic jumps, it is not advisable to allow
them to occur except under controlled circumstances. Therefore, if during the
design of a channel, a hydraulic jump is expected to occur, computations shall
be made to determine the height, length and other characteristics of the jump.
In addition, steps shall be taken to either eliminate the jump or contain it,
in order to prevent damage to the channel or surrounding property.
      (3)   Procedures for analyzing the hydraulic jump are well documented in
the references cited at the beginning of this chapter as well as in numerous
other easily available hydraulic texts and manuals.
   (F)   Curved channels.
      (1)   Flow in a curved channel will create centrifugal forces that will
cause a rise in the water surface along the outside of a bend. At the same
time, a corresponding depression will be created in the water surface along the
inside of the bend. In addition, spiral secondary currents tend to form within
the bends. These currents can cause scour to occur along the outside of a bend,
and deposition along the inside of a bend. Cross-channel waves that propagate
downstream will also form, if the flow in the channel is supercritical.
      (2)   Although curves are inevitable in the design of most open channels,
they should be minimized in order to avoid the special problems associated with
their design. The design of channel bends must include considerations for
superelevation, limiting curvature, bend scour, and special design curves.
   (G)   Transitions.
      (1)   Transition sections designed to collect and/or discharge flow
between the natural floodplain and constructed channels can be located at
either the upstream or downstream ends of constructed channels. They can also
be located along a segment or segments of a constructed channel itself. In
either case, it is necessary to design the flow transition to minimize the
disturbance of flow. In the case where flow in a constructed channel is being
transitioned back to the natural floodplain, sufficient distance must be
allowed for the flow to adequately expand to the original width of the natural
floodplain.
      (2)   Procedures for analyzing curved channels and transitions are well
documented in the references cited at the beginning of this chapter as well as
in other easily available hydraulic texts and manuals.

CULVERTS AND STORM DRAINS
§ 152.80 PURPOSE.
   This chapter provides policies and criteria for the analysis and design of
culverts and storm drain systems. Analysis methodologies are provided mainly by
reference to widely accepted and available design manuals that have been
prepared by the Federal Highway Administration and other government agencies.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.81 POLICIES.
   (A)   All natural drainages crossing roadways will be culverted, unless
otherwise approved by the Public Works Engineer.
   (B)   Street crossings shall be designed, as a minimum, to convey the post-
development or future condition 10-year peak discharge under the road. The 24-
hour duration storm shall be used for estimation of peak discharges for all
watersheds greater than 160 acres in area. The peak discharges from the PDMP
shall be used where available. Regardless of the size of the culvert, street
crossings are to be designed to convey the post-development or future condition
100-year peak discharge under and/or over the road to an area downstream of the
crossing to which the flow would have gone in the absence of the crossing. 100-
year flow depths over the roadway shall not exceed 1 foot in depth. Flows up to
or including the 100-year frequency shall not cause increased flooding of
private land, developable lands or buildings, unless a drainage easement is
obtained for those areas. The ponded headwater elevation shall be delineated on
the site topography map, or delineated by field survey, as required.
   (C)   The minimum size for culverts draining roadways is 24 inches in
diameter or arch equivalent, and for driveways is 18 inches in diameter, unless
otherwise approved by the Pubic Works Engineer.
   (D)   Culverts shall have adequate end treatment at both ends.
   (E)   Outlet protection shall be evaluated for all culverts as described in
this chapter.
   (F)   All culverts shall be placed in the natural flow line and channel
whenever possible. A detail showing the proposed culvert(s) is required. The
detail will include but shall not be limited to, invert elevations, top of road
elevations, headwalls, inflow and outflow channel geometry, skew angle, and
erosion protection.
   (G)   Minimum cover of fill over culverts must be provided to maintain the
structural integrity of the pipe under anticipated loading conditions. Culvert
manufacturers provide minimum cover requirements for prefabricated pipe. All
street crossing culverts shall have a minimum of one foot of cover. Minimum
cover shall be measured from the top of subgrade, which is the bottom of the
pavement structural section.
   (H)   Storm drains shall be designed such that the flow depth during a 10-
year 24-hour event shall not exceed the top of curb. Storm drains shall be
designed such that the peak discharge during a 100-year 24-hour event is
contained within the town right-of-way.
   (I)   The minimum pipe diameter allowable for public storm-drain systems is
18 inches, unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Engineer. In general
main-line storm drains should be at least 24 inches in diameter.
   (J)   Public storm-drain systems should be designed for gravity flow
whenever possible.
   (K)   The minimum flow velocity in a storm drain is three feet-per-second,
for purposes of self- cleaning.
   (L)   The minimum allowable storm-drain slope for concrete or smooth metal
pipe shall be 0.1%. However a minimum slope at 0.3% is desirable, whenever
possible.
   (M)   Manholes shall be located at storm drain junctions, changes in pipe
size, sharp curves, angle points in excess of ten degrees and at abrupt changes
in grade. Manholes shall also be located at regular intervals as follows:
      (1)   300 feet: Pipe diameter 30"
      (2)   400 feet: 30" < Pipe diameter 48"
      (3)   500 feet: Pipe Diameter > 48"
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.82 CULVERT DESIGN PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Culvert hydraulics.
      (1)   Culvert hydraulics shall be evaluated using the procedures
established by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) as presented within
the publication entitled Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts (1985), often
referred to as “HDS-5". Culverts shall be evaluated for both inlet control and
outlet control, to ensure that the correct headwater elevation is determined.
Use of computer programs, such as the FHWA “HY-8" (1999) program or
equivalents, is also acceptable for culvert analysis and selection.
      (2)   In order to expedite review and approval of the hydraulic design of
culverts by the Public Works Engineer, the Culvert Design Form within “HDS-5"
should be used. This form is also provided as Figure 7.1. The computer reports
produced by the “HY-8" or equivalent programs are also acceptable for
presenting culvert analysis results.
   (B)   Debris grates.
      (1)   As part of the culvert design process, the engineer shall consider
whether or not the upstream watershed would yield sufficient naturally produced
or man-made debris to pose a potential blockage problem. If debris is
considered a problem, then an appropriate grate shall be considered, or the
culvert shall be enlarged to account for blockage. Because of the large number
of combinations of culverts and types of debris possible, there is no single
standard grate design. Rather, the engineer is advised to review the Federal
Highway Administration manual entitled Debris-Control Structures (1971) to help
aid in selecting an appropriate debris grate.
      (2)   It is the policy of the Public Works Department that debris grates
on culverts be used only where necessary. The recommended method of accounting
for expected debris problems is to increase the size of the culvert, whenever
possible.
   (C)   Outlet protection.
      (1)   Outlet protection shall be evaluated for all culverts. The
following guidelines, adapted from the Arizona Department of Transportation,
are suggested for determining what type of outlet protection is required.
Outlet protection shall be required as shown in Table 7.1 where erodible soil
conditions exist in the downstream channel bed and/or banks.
   Table 7.1: Culvert Outlet Protection Requirements
 
Culvert Outlet Velocity               Required Outlet Protection
Less than 4 fps                       No protection required
More than 4 fps and less than 10 fps  Dumped rock riprap (See §
                                      152.72(B)(2))
More than 10 fps and less than 15 fps Wire tied or grouted rock riprap
Greater than 15 fps                   Energy dissipater
 
      (2)   For culverts with outlet velocities greater than 15 fps, an energy
dissipater shall be considered. The objective of an energy dissipater is to
return the flow to a condition that approximates the existing flow width, depth
and velocity. The engineer designing energy dissipaters shall refer to the FHWA
publication entitled Hydraulic Design of Energy Dissipater for Culverts and
Channels, HEC No. 14, (1983).
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.83 STORM DRAIN DESIGN PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Storm drain hydraulics.
      (1)   The hydraulic design of storm drain systems includes the
determination of flow peaks, the evaluation of street and gutter flow, capacity
and spacing of inlets and hydraulic grade line computations for the underground
conduits. The procedures provided within §§
152.30 -
152.39 shall be used for determining flow peaks for the design of storm drain
systems. A number of widely distributed manuals are available which provide
hydraulic design procedures for evaluation of street and gutter flow, inlet
design and hydraulic grade line calculations, as listed below.
   Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (Vol. 1, 2, & 3, June 2001), Denver
Regional Council of Governments.
   Drainage of Highway Pavements (HEC-12) (1984), Federal Highway
Administration.
   Design of Urban Highway Drainage - The State of the Art, Federal Highway
Administration (1979).
   Drainage Design Manual for Maricopa County, Arizona, Volume II - Hydraulics
(August, 2013).
      (2)   A number of computer programs are available for performing
hydraulic grade line (HGL) calculations. The use of appropriate computer
programs are acceptable; however, in order to facilitate review and approval by
the Public Works Department, the results of any HGL computation should be
compiled on a standard Hydraulic Grade Line Calculation Sheet such as is
provided on Figure 7.2. In addition, a profile plot of the hydraulic grade line
shall be provided which, at a minimum, provides pipe invert elevations, the
hydraulic grade line, energy grade line, ground surface, pipe sizes, junctions,
curves, angle points, man-holes, laterals and the downstream controlling tail
water.
   (B)   Inlet clogging design factors. The following guidelines shall be
followed to provide an appropriate factor of safety against clogging of
pavement inlets:
      (1)   Grates.
         (a)   Sump conditions.
            1.   Orifice flow: required area = 2 x calculated area.
            2.   Weir flow: required perimeter = 2 x calculated perimeter.
         (b)   Continuous-grade conditions: Required length of opening = 2 x
calculated length.
      (2)   Curb opening inlets.
         (a)   Sump conditions: required length of opening = 1.5 x calculated
length.
         (b)   Continuous-grade conditions: Required length of opening = 1.25 x
calculated length.
      (3)   Combination grate and curb opening.
         (a)   Sump conditions.
            1.   Orifice flow: required area = 2 x calculated area for grate;
required length = 1.25 x calculated length for curb inlet.
            2.   Weir flow: required perimeter = 2.0 x calculated perimeter for
grate; required length = 1.25 calculated length for curb inlet.
         (b)   Continuous-grade conditions: required length of opening = 1.5 x
calculated length for grate; required length = 1.25 x calculated length for
curb inlet.
      (4)   Slotted drains.
         (a)   Sump conditions: required length = 2 x calculated length.
         (b)   Continuous-grade conditions:
            1.   Parallel to flow: required length = 1.5 x calculated length.
            2.   Perpendicular to flow: Do not use.
   (C)   General guidelines.  These general guidelines shall be used unless
more detailed information related to clogging for a specific grate type is
available from the manufacturer. All storm drain inlet grates shall be designed
to prevent bicycle tire penetration (i.e. "bicycle-safe" grates).

EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION
§ 152.90 PURPOSE.
   This chapter provides certain criteria and considerations that apply to
alluvial watercourses (i.e. watercourses formed within unconsolidated
sediments. This chapter does not apply to watercourses within the town that are
formed within bedrock or highly stabilized geologic formations. The engineer
shall investigate the specific watercourse characteristics and discuss the
matter with the Public Works Engineer, to determine whether erosion and
sedimentation concerns need to be addressed for a particular project.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.91 POLICIES.
   (A)   Erosion control for drainage channels in all new developments shall
conform with §§
152.110 - 152.131.
   (B)   Assessment of erosion hazards shall be performed for all proposed
development adjacent to alluvial (i.e. sand and gravel bed) watercourses within
the town.
   (C)   Adequate building setbacks shall be established or bank stabilization
measures shall provide for all development along alluvial watercourses.
   (D)   A minimum building setback of ten feet applies to all channel banks
and floodways. The Public Works Engineer, based on application of structural
erosion control measures, may grant exceptions.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.92 APPLICABILITY AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Bank protection requirements.
      (1)   Bank protection measures to be designed along alluvial watercourses
will require scour analyses to determine bank protection toe-downs, unless the
entire channel bottom will be lined. Toe- downs refer to the vertical distance
that the bank protection extends below the invert of the channel. The design
scour depth, to which the bank protection toe-downs must extend, are determined
by adding various scour components, as appropriate, and applying a safety
factor to the result. The scour components that must be addressed include the
following:
         (a)   General scour.
         (b)   Anti-dune trough depth.
         (c)   Local scour.
         (d)   Bend scour.
         (e)   Low-flow thalweg.
      (2)   Each of these scour components must be determined and summed in
order to determine the Total Scour. A safety factor of 1.3 is typically applied
to the Total Scour to determine the depth of toe- down for the bank protection.
Detailed procedures and equations for estimating each of the above scour
components is provided within the following publications:
         (a)   Design Manual for Engineering Analysis of Fluvial Systems,
Arizona Department of Water Resources (1985).
         (b)   Standards Manual for Drainage Design and Floodplain Management
in Tucson, Arizona, (1989).
         (c)   Watercourse Bank Stabilization SSA 7-98, Arizona Department of
Water Resources (1998).
      (3)   Engineers engaged in the analysis and design of flood-control and
erosion-control facilities on sand and gravel bed watercourses within the town
shall become familiar with these references and utilize the procedures
contained therein. The procedures presented within these manuals are acceptable
for designing bank protection toe-downs within the town.
   (B)   Grade-control structures.
      (1)   When channelization of a natural watercourse occurs, the top width
is usually narrowed, and channel roughness is normally decreased. This usually
results in an increase in flow velocity and possibly depth of flow, with a
corresponding increase in sediment-transport capacity. Sediment transport
capacity then exceeds sediment supply; then if the channel is composed of
transportable sediments, the channel bed will begin to degrade. Another factor
that contributes to this degradation is the upstream urbanization of the
watershed. Urbanization typically increases runoff and decreases sediment
yield, which further increases sediment transport. The result of all these
factors is that channel bed degradation will continue until the channel slope
flattens enough that the sediment transport rate equals the incoming sediment
supply. Streambed degradation can become extreme over time and can threaten
underground utilities, bank protection, culverts and other structures that are
within or near the watercourse. Under these conditions, grade-control
structures or lining of the channel bed are usually required in order to
prevent damage by streambed degradation.
      (2)   An analysis to assess the potential need for grade-control
structures will be required for all proposed channelization projects on
alluvial or sand and gravel bed watercourses within the town. Analysis
procedures to perform this assessment are provided within the two previously
referenced manuals (i.e. Arizona Department of Water Resources and City of
Tucson).
   (C)   Bridge scour. In addition to standard hydraulic analyses associated
with bridge design, a scour analysis is also required for proposed bridges
located within alluvial or sand and gravel bed watercourses. These analyses
require assessment of the scour components listed previously within this
chapter, with special attention given to local scour at bridge piers and
abutments. In addition to the two previously cited references relating to scour
analysis, the following publication provides additional analysis procedures
specific to scour analyses of bridge structures: Highways in the River
Environment (1990), U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration.
   (D)   Building setbacks.
      (1)   Prudent building setbacks shall be established for all proposed
development adjacent to alluvial watercourses within the town. Channel bark
erodibility may be assessed, and erosion setbacks may be established by using
procedures developed by the Natural Resource Conservation Service. These
procedures are presented in detail in the previously referenced City of Tucson
Standards Manual for Drainage Design and Floodplain Management (1989) and
consist of the Allowable-Velocity Approach, Tractive-Stress Approach, and the
Tractive-Power Approach. These procedures are also presented in State Standard
for Watercourse System Sediment Balance, Guideline 1 Lateral Migration Setback
Allowance for Riverine Floodplains in Arizona SSA 5-96, Arizona Department of
Water Resources (1996). In lieu of performing a detailed erosion study, the
following equations (8.1a, 8.1b and 8.1c) may be used to establish setbacks to
guard against lateral migration of unstabilized channel banks associated with
alluvial watercourses which have drainage areas of less than 30 square miles
(City of Tucson, 1989):
      SB $ 1.0 (Q p100 ) 0.5 , for r c /T $ 10 (Eqn. 8.1a)
      SB $ 1.7 (Q p100 ) 0.5 , for 5 < r c /T < 10 (Eqn. 8.1b)
      SB $ 2.5 (Q p100 ) 0.5 , for r c   # 5 (Eqn. 8.1c)
   Where:
      SB =   Minimum setback, in feet, measured from the top edge of the
highest channel bank or from the edge of the 100-year floodplain limit,
whichever is closer to the channel centerline.
      Q p100 = Peak discharge of 100-year flood, in cubic feet per second.
      r c = Radius of curvature of channel centerline, in feet.
      T = Top width of channel, in feet.
   Notes:    1. Equations 8.1b and 8.1c apply only to setbacks on the outside
of the channel bend. Equation 8.1a may be used for setbacks on the inside of a
channel bend.
       2. See Figure 6.2 of this chapter for determining r c and T w
      (2)   Lesser setbacks than those determined from Equations 8.1 may be
allowed provided they can be justified by use of the following methods, which
would indicate that a lesser setback is appropriate. The Public Works Engineer
must approve the use of lesser setbacks in writing.
      (3)   A detailed sediment transport analysis, prepared by an Arizona
Registered Professional Civil Engineer.
      (4)   The Allowable-Velocity Approach, Tractive-Stress Approach, or
Tractive-Power Approach (City of Tucson, 1989), any or all of which must
indicate that the channel banks are not erosive for the flow conditions
associated with runoff events up to and including a 100-year flood on the
affected watercourse.

STREET AND PARKING LOT DRAINAGE
§ 152.100 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide town policies related to storm
water flow within street sections and allowable ponding depths within parking
areas.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.101 POLICIES.
   (A)   Streets and roadways.
      (1)   Cross-drainage structures shall be provided to pass flow under
streets without diversion to adjacent properties. Street crossings shall be
designed to convey the 10-year peak discharge under the road. Regardless of the
size of the culvert, street crossings are to be designed to convey the 100-year
peak discharge under and/or over the road. The maximum depth of flow over the
road during the post-development or future condition 100-year event is one
foot. The 100-year flow is to be directed to an area downstream of the crossing
to which the flow would have gone in the absence of the crossing. Flows up to
and including the 100-year frequency shall not cause increased flooding of
private land, developable lands or buildings, unless a drainage easement is
obtained for those areas. The ponded headwater elevation shall be delineated on
the site topography map, or delineated by field survey, as required.
      (2)   If drainage is to be carried in streets, minimum pavement widths
may be increased to handle flows or as required by the Public Works Department.
      (3)   Roadside drainage channels shall be in accordance with the drainage
analysis and the drainage plan as approved by the Public Works Department.
Roadside drainage channels are not allowed adjacent to streets with curb and
gutter.
      (4)   Inverted crown streets will not be acceptable without written
approval of a variance from the Public Works Department. Inverted crown streets
shall be constructed using portland cement concrete.
      (5)   In general, "at-grade" or "dip" crossings are not permitted. Where
the construction of a culvert is not practical or desirable, a grated concrete
channel may be constructed to convey the storm water below the driving surface.
      (6)   Depth of flow in the roadside drainage channels for the design
storm shall be lower than the adjacent subgrade elevation.
      (7)   Local soil conditions, flow depths, and velocities within the
channel are usually the primary hydraulic considerations in channel geometric
design; however, terrain and safety considerations have considerable influence.
Steeper side slopes of rigid, lined channels may be more economical and will
improve the hydraulic flow characteristics. The use of steeper slopes is
normally limited to areas with limited roadway where the hazard to traffic can
be minimized through the use of guardrails or parapets.
      (8)   Whenever possible, storm water shall be conveyed separately from
the street system and defined drainageways shall follow existing alignments.
      (9)   Curb requirements for developments are based on zoning regulations,
outlined in the most recent edition of the UDC.
      (10)   Runoff conveyed by the street section shall be limited as follows:
         (a)   Ten-year storm event or flow depth at the top of curb, whichever
is less.
         (b)   Streets without curb and gutter shall convey drainage in bar
ditches.
         (c)   The 100-year 24-hour storm peak discharge must be contained
within the street right-of-way or within the tract designated for private
streets.
      (11)   If curbs and gutters are to be installed, a detailed cross-section
of the proposed curb and gutter shall be specified on the Project Plans for
approval before construction. Construction and design shall be to the latest
ADOT or M.A.G. Standard Specifications and approved by the Public Works
Department.
      (12)   Drainage ditches behind curbs are not allowed.
   (B)   Parking lots.
      (1)   Parking shall be permitted in the floodplains of watercourses
provided that the maximum depth of flow does not exceed two feet during a 100-
year flood. Overnight parking will be limited to floodplains where the flooding
does not exceed one foot in depth during the 100-year flood, unless otherwise
approved by the town.
      (2)   Any parking lot that is located within a 100-year floodplain shall
have a prominent sign posted at the entrance to the parking area that contains
the information that the parking lot is subject to periodic flooding of depths
up to "x" feet, and that overnight parking is not advised.
      (3)   Parking areas may be used as detention/retention facilities
provided that maximum depths of ponding do not exceed one foot. The areas which
have the maximum depth of ponding shall be located in the more remote areas of
the parking lot, whenever feasible.
      (4)   Any portion of a parking lot that is located within a detention/
retention facility shall have a prominent sign posted at the entrance to the
parking area. The sign shall contain the information that the parking lot is
subject to periodic flooding of depths up to "x" feet, and that overnight
parking is not advised.
   (C)   Design procedures. Hydraulic calculations for flow in gutters and
street sections, and design of storm drain inlets shall be done in conformance
with Drainage of Highway Pavements, Hydraulic Engineering Circular 12, Federal
Highway Administration (1984).

division (B)(2) of this section shall include an adequate description of the
geology of the site, conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of
geologic conditions on the proposed development, and opinion on the adequacy
for the intended use of sites to be developed by the proposed grading, as
affected by geologic factors. The engineering geology report may be included in
the geotechnical report or may be waived in writing by the Public Works
Department.
   (E)   Permit issuance.
      (1)   The application, plans, specifications, computations and other data
filed by an applicant for a permit shall be reviewed by the building official.
Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of this jurisdiction to verify
compliance with any applicable laws under their jurisdiction. If the Town
Engineer finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the
plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the
requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the
fees specified have been paid, the Town Engineer shall issue a permit therefor
to the applicant.
      (2)   When the Town Engineer issues the permit where plans are required,
the Town Engineer shall endorse the plans in writing stating his approval. Such
approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered
without authorizations from the Town Engineer, and all work regulated by this
chapter shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.
      (3)   (a)   The Town Engineer may issue a permit for the grading of a
site when only a "Foundation Only" permit has been issued for building
construction on the site before the entire building plans and specifications
have been approved. However, any construction on the site is at the risk of the
contractor and owner if there are changes required once the full plans are
approved. The holder of the "Foundation Only" permit shall proceed without
assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.
         (b)   The Town Engineer may also issue an "At-Risk" grading permit for
projects other than single and two family residential units if the following
criteria are met:
            1.   The grading and drainage plan for the project has been
approved.
            2.   The building plans, including landscaping plans, have been
submitted for review by the town.
            3.   The developer has posted a bond in favor of the Town of Payson
in an amount adequate to re-vegetate and landscape disturbed areas of the site.
The intent of this bond is to pay for any site re-vegetation or landscaping
needed to restore the site if the project does not receive a full building
permit within 90 days. The amount of the bond shall be the estimated cost to
re-vegetate and landscape the site determined by an Arizona registered
professional. The bond will be released once landscape plans have been approved
and a full building permit is issued for the project.
            4.   The developer/owner understands and agrees that all site work
prior to the issuance of a full building permit is at their risk if any changes
or modifications are required based upon final building plan approval.
            5.   The holder of the "At-Risk" grading permit shall proceed
without any assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will
be granted.
      (4)   The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of the plans,
specifications and computations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or
an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of
any ordinance of the town. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or
cancel the provisions of this manual or other ordinances of the town shall not
be valid.
      (5)   The issuance of a permit based on plans, specifications and other
data shall not prevent the Town Engineer from thereafter requiring the
correction of errors in said plans, specifications and other data, or from
preventing construction operations being carried on thereunder when in
violation of this chapter or of any ordinance of the town.
      (6)   Permits issued under the requirements of this subchapter shall not
relieve the owner of the responsibility for securing required permits for work
to be done which is regulated by any ordinance, department, or division of the
town or other governing agency.
      (7)   Every grading permit issued by the Town Engineer under the
provisions of this chapter that is in conjunction with a building permit shall
run concurrent with and be valid for the term of the building permit.
      (8)   Every grading permit issued by the Town Engineer under the
provisions of this chapter that is not in conjunction with a building permit
shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by
such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or
if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time
after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before such work can be
re-commenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee
therefore shall be one half the amount required for a new permit for such work,
provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and
specifications for such work, and provided further that such suspension or
abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit
after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee.
      (9)   Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an
extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when the
permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this section
for good and satisfactory reasons. The Town Engineer may extend the time for
action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days on written request
by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee
have prevented action from being taken. No permit shall be extended more than
once.
      (10)   In granting any permit under this chapter, the Town Engineer may
attach such conditions as may be reasonably necessary to prevent creation of a
nuisance or hazard to public or private property. Such conditions may include,
but shall not be limited to:
         (a)   Compliance with dust control requirements of the town or county.
         (b)   Requirements for fencing of excavations or fills which would
otherwise be hazardous.
         (c)   Improvement of any existing site condition to bring it up to the
standards of this chapter.
      (11)   Neither the issuance of a permit under the provisions of this
chapter nor the compliance with the provisions hereof, or with any conditions
imposed in the permit issued hereunder, shall relieve any person from
responsibility for damage to other persons or property, nor impose any
liability upon the town for damage to other persons or property.
      (12)   The Town Engineer may require that grading operations and project
designs be modified if delays occur which incur weather-generated problems not
considered at the time the permit was issued.
      (13)   The Town Engineer may require professional inspection and testing
by the geotechnical engineer. When the Town Engineer has cause to believe that
geologic factors may be involved, the grading will be required to conform to
engineered grading.
      (14)   The Town Engineer may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit
issued under the provisions of this code whenever the permit is issued in error
or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any
ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this chapter.

   (A)   General. Unless otherwise recommended in the approved soils
engineering or engineering geology report, cuts shall conform to the provisions
of this section. Any soils engineering or engineering geology report shall be
sealed by an appropriately registered engineer in the State of Arizona. In the
absence of an approved soils engineering report, these provisions may be waived
for minor cuts (less than six inches deep) not intended to support structures.
   (B)   Slope of cut. The slope of cut surfaces shall be no steeper than is
safe for the intended use and shall be no steeper than 1 unit vertical in 2
units horizontal (50% slope) unless the permittee furnishes a soils engineering
or an engineering geology report, or both, stating that the site has been
investigated and giving an opinion that a cut at a steeper slope will be stable
and not erode or create a hazard to public or private property.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
Cross-reference:
   Drainage requirements above a cut slope, see §
152.123(F)
§ 152.121 FILLS.
   (A)   General. Unless otherwise recommended in the approved soils
engineering or engineering geology report, fills shall conform to the
provisions of this section. Any soils engineering or engineering geology report
shall be sealed by an appropriately registered engineer in the State of
Arizona. In the absence of an approved soils engineering report, these
provisions may be waived for minor fills (less than six inches deep) not
intended to support structures.
   (B)   Preparation of ground. Fill slopes shall not be constructed on natural
slopes steeper than 1 unit vertical in 2 units horizontal (50% slope). The
ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, non-
complying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable materials scarifying to provide a
bond with the new fill and, where slopes are steeper than 1 unit vertical in 5
units horizontal (20% slope) and the height is greater than 5 feet, by benching
into sound bedrock or other competent material as determined by the soils
engineer. The bench under the toe of a fill on a slope steeper than 1 unit
vertical in 5 units horizontal (20% slope) shall be at least 10 feet wide. The
area beyond the toe of fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a paved drain
shall be provided. When fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the
toe of fill shall be at least 10 feet wide but the cut shall be made before
placing the fill and acceptance by the soils engineer or engineering geologist
or both as suitable foundation for fills.
   (C)   Fill material. Detrimental amounts of organic material shall not be
permitted in fills. Except as permitted by the Town Engineer, no rock or
similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than 12 inches
shall be buried or placed in fills.
   (D)   Exception. The Town Engineer may permit placement of larger rock in
fills when the following conditions are followed:
      (1)   When a soils engineer properly devises a method of placement, and
continuously inspects its placement and approves the fill stability.
      (2)   Rock sizes greater than 12 inches in maximum dimension shall be 10
feet or more below grade, measured vertically.
      (3)   Rocks shall be placed so as to assure filling of all voids with
well-graded soil.
   (E)   Compaction. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of 90% of
maximum density for all areas not under a structure. Any compaction in a fill
under a structure shall meet the Building Department requirements.
   (F)   Slope of fill.  The slope of fill surfaces shall be no steeper than is
safe for the intended use. Fill slopes steeper than 1 unit vertical to 3 units
horizontal (33.3% slope) shall be protected from erosion by rip-rap being an
average size of 6 inches in diameter, or larger. Exceptions may be made for
revegetating the slope to provide stability and erosion protection. Fill slopes
shall be no steeper than 1 unit vertical to 2 units horizontal (50% slope)
unless the permittee furnishes a soils engineering or an engineering geology
report, or both, stating that the site has been investigated and giving an
opinion that a fill at a steeper slope will be stable and not erode and will
not create a hazard to public or private property.

   Figure 10.1: Setback Requirements
   (B)   Top of cut slope. The top of cut slopes shall not be made nearer to a
site boundary line than one fifth of the vertical height of cut with a minimum
set back distance of 2 feet unless approved in writing by the adjoining
property owner. The setback may need to be increased for any required
interceptor drains.
   (C)   Toe of fill slope. The toe of fill slope shall be made not nearer to
the site boundary line than one half the height of the slope with a minimum of
set back distance of 2 feet and unless approved in writing by the adjoining
property owner. Where a fill slope is to be located near the site boundary and
the adjacent off-site property is developed, special precautions shall be
incorporated in the work as the Town Engineer deems necessary to protect the
adjoining property from damage as a result of such grading. These precautions
may include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Additional setback distance;
      (2)   Provisions for retaining or slough walls;
      (3)   Mechanical or chemical treatment of the fill slope surface to
minimize erosion; or
      (4)   Provisions for the control of surface waters.
   (D)   Modification of slope location.  The Town Engineer may approve
alternate setbacks. The Town Engineer may require an investigation and
recommendation by a qualified engineer or engineering geologist to demonstrate
that the intent of this section has been satisfied.

9-17-15; Am. Ord. 872, passed 9-17-15)
§ 152.123 DRAINAGE AND TERRACING.
   (A)   General. Unless otherwise indicated on the approved grading plan,
drainage facilities and terracing shall conform to the provisions of this
section for cut and fill slopes steeper than 1 unit vertical in 3 units
horizontal (33.3% slope).
   (B)   Terraces. Terraces at least 6 feet in width shall be established at
not more than 30-foot vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes to control
surface drainage and debris except that where only one terrace is required, it
shall be at midheight. For cut or fill slopes greater than 60 feet and up to
120 feet in vertical height, one terrace at approximately midheight shall be 12
feet in width. Terrace widths and spacing for cut and fill slopes greater than
120 feet in height shall be designed by a registered civil engineer and
approved by the Town Engineer. Suitable access shall be provided to permit
proper cleaning and maintenance. Swales or ditches on terraces shall have a
minimum gradient of 5% and must be paved with reinforced concrete not less than
3 inches in thickness or an approved equal type of paving. They shall have a
minimum depth at the deepest point of 1 foot and a minimum paved width of 5
feet. A single run of swale or ditch shall not collect runoff from a tributary
area exceeding 13,500 square feet without discharging into a down drain.
   (C)   Roof drainage and other surface drainage. It shall be a violation of
this chapter to concentrate roof drainage or other surface drainage on a
property and pass it to an adjoining property unless at least one of the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   The drain terminates in a natural drainageway that normally carries
stormwater runoff during a storm event and is capable of containing the
additional runoff.
      (2)   The drain terminates in a constructed channel on private property
that is designed to contain the stormwater runoff, including any additional
created from the new drains.
      (3)   The drain terminates in a drainage ditch constructed in the public
right-of-way.
      (4)   The drain terminates no closer than 20 feet from any property line
and the flows are spread out to assimilate natural sheet flow, rather than a
concentrated flow, prior to exiting the property.
      (5)   The adjacent property owner provides permission to allow the
concentrated flow to enter his property. This permission must be granted in
writing, recorded with the Gila County Recorder and a recorded copy of the
permission presented to the Town Engineer.
   (D)   Subsurface drainage. Cut and fill slopes shall be provided with
subsurface drainage as necessary for stability.
   (E)   Disposal. All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry waters to
the nearest practicable drainage way approved by the Town Engineer as a safe
place to deposit such waters. Erosion of ground in the area of discharge shall
be prevented by installation of non-erosive down drains, rip-rap, or other
approved devices.
   (F)   Interceptor drains. Paved interceptor drains shall be installed along
the top of all cut slopes where the tributary drainage area above slopes toward
the cut and has a drainage path greater than 40 feet measured horizontally.
Interceptor drains shall be paved with a minimum of 3 inches of concrete or
gunite and reinforced. They shall have a minimum depth of 12 inches and a
minimum paved width of 30 inches measured horizontally across the drain. The
slope of the drain shall be approved by the Town Engineer.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02; Am. Ord. 782, passed 6-3-10)
§ 152.124 EROSION CONTROL.
   (A)   Slopes. The faces of cut and fill slopes shall be prepared and
maintained to control against erosion. This control may consist of effective
planting. The protection for the slopes shall be installed as soon as
practicable and prior to calling for final approval. Where cut slopes are not
subject to erosion due to the erosion-resistant character of the materials,
such protection may be omitted.
   (B)   Other devices. Where necessary, check dams, cribbing, rip-rap or other
devices or methods shall be employed to control erosion and provide safety.
Erosion protection is recommended for all fill and cut slopes and is always
required for all fill slopes steeper than 1 unit vertical to 3 units horizontal
(33.3% slope).
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.125 PROHIBITION OF MASS GRADING.
   (A)   General. The intent of this section is to prohibit mass site grading
in any single family residential developments and to provide general controls
for mass site grading on all other types of development including but not
limited to multi-family, commercial and industrial.
   (B)   Single family residential. Mass grading within single family
residential subdivisions is strictly prohibited. The only area available for
grading in a single family residential development with subdivision approval is
the road right-of-way and public utility easements and slope easements. Grading
on individual lots, including but not limited to the driveway, building pad and
utilities shall not be commenced until a building permit has been issued for
that lot by the building department.
   (C)   Exception. Grading on a single family residential lot prior to the
issuance of a building permit is allowable if all of the following conditions
are met:
      (1)   An engineered grading, drainage and erosion control plan is
required prior to issuance of a building permit either by the recorded
subdivision plat or the Hillside Ordinance.
      (2)   The engineered grading, drainage and erosion control plan meets all
of the town requirements and is approved by the Town Engineer.
      (3)   The property owner agrees to begin construction of a house on this
lot within 12 months of issuance of a grading permit and posts a bond with the
town as an assurance of this construction. The minimum value of the bond shall
be equal to the construction of houses in general on this type of lot.
   (D)   Developments other than single family residential. Multi-family,
commercial and industrial developments normally require a much more even
topography than single family residential. Therefore, portions of non-single
family residential developments may be mass graded in order to meet the
requirements of the project. However, the design shall be as compatible with
the existing topography and attempt to leave as much natural vegetation in
place as practical.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02; Am. Ord. 782, passed 6-3-10)
§ 152.126 HILLSIDE CONSTRUCTION.
   Any property determined to be “Hillside” property in accordance with the
Unified Development Code Section 15-07-002-H shall meet all the requirements of
the Hillside Subdivisions as contained in the Unified Development Code Section
15-07-002-H and the requirements of §
152.117(C).
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.127 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   General. Grading operations for which a permit is required shall be
subject to inspections by the Town Engineer. Professional inspection of grading
operations by a civil engineer, soils engineer and an engineering geologist
retained by the permittee may be required by the Town Engineer. These
professionals shall provide such services in accordance with §
152.123(B).
   (B)   Permittee. The permittee shall be responsible for the work to be
performed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, and the permittee shall engage
consultants, as required, to provide professional inspections on a timely
basis. The permittee shall act as a coordinator between the consultants, the
contractor and the Town Engineer. In the event of changed conditions, the
permittee shall be responsible for informing the Town Engineer of such change
and shall provide revised plans for approval.
   (C)   Town Engineer. The Town Engineer or his or her representative shall
inspect the project at the various stages of work requiring approval to
determine that adequate control is being exercised by the permittee and his
professional consultants.
   (D)   Notification of noncompliance. If, in the course of fulfilling their
respective duties under this section, the civil engineer, the soils engineer or
the engineering geologist finds that the work is not being done in conformance
with this chapter or the approved grading plans, the discrepancies shall be
reported immediately in writing to the permittee and to the Town Engineer.
   (E)   Transfer of responsibility. If the civil engineer, the soils engineer,
or the engineering geologist of record is changed during grading, the work
shall be stopped until the replacement has agreed in writing to accept their
responsibility within the area of technical competence for approval upon
completion of work. It shall be the duty of the permittee to notify the Town
Engineer in writing of such change prior to the re-commencement of such
grading. The permittee is still ultimately responsible for all work under the
grading permit being carried out in a proper manner and in conformance with the
permit and plans.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02; Am. Ord. 782, passed 6-3-10)
§ 152.128 RESPONSIBILITY OF PERMITTEE.

shall be presumed to include the provisions that the applicant, his agent,
contractors, or employees, shall carry out the proposed work in accordance with
the approved plans and specifications and in compliance with all the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Protection of utilities. During the grading operations, the permittee
shall be responsible for the prevention of damage to any street or drainage
facilities or to any public utilities or services. This responsibility applies
within the limits of grading and along any routes of travel of equipment.
   (C)   Protection of adjacent property. The permittee is responsible for the
prevention of damage to adjacent property and no person shall excavate on land
sufficiently close to the property line to endanger any adjoining public
street, sidewalk, alley, or other public or private property prior to
supporting and protecting such property from settling, cracking or other damage
which might result.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02)
§ 152.129 MODIFICATION OF APPROVED PLANS.
   No modification of the approved grading plans may be made without the
approval of the Town Engineer. All necessary soils and geological reports shall
be submitted with the plans.
(Res. 1637, passed 2-28-02; Am. Ord. 782, passed 6-3-10)
§ 152.130 COMPLETION OF WORK.
   (A)   Final reports.
      (1)   Upon completion of the rough grading work and at the final
completion of the work, the following reports and drawings and supplements
thereto are required for engineered grading ore when professional inspection is
performed for regular grading, as applicable.
      (2)   As-constructed drawings shall be submitted in accordance with §

§ 154-02-002 ZONING MAP AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The locations and boundaries of the various zoning districts are established
as they are shown on the map entitled "Town of Payson Zoning Map" as amended
and approved by the Council. The Zoning Map, as amended, is an official record
and is part of this Code.
   (A)   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any of the districts
shown on the Zoning Map the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Zoning district boundary lines generally follow street, alley, lot
or property lines, as they exist at the effective date of this Code, except
where district boundary lines are specifically fixed by other dimensions shown
on the Zoning Map.
      (2)   Where a zoning district boundary is not clearly discernible on the
Zoning Map, the boundaries shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Where a lot is divided by one or more district boundary lines, the
entire lot shall be deemed to be included in the most restrictive district
classification unless the less restrictive uses have already been established
for a majority of the allowable density. This zoning standard applies only to
properties created after the adoption of the Unified Development Code and does
not apply to multi-zoned properties, legally existing, before the Unified
Development Code was adopted.
   (B)   Where a public street, alley, or other right-of-way is officially
abandoned, the district classification assigned to the abutting property shall
apply, except where such was a boundary between districts, in which case the
districts shall be extended to the centerline.
   (C)   Conditions imposed by special ordinance in conjunction with amendments
to the Zoning Map are considered an integral part of the Zoning Map.
   (D)   Territory annexed to the town subsequent to the effective date of this
Code, shall be assigned a zoning district classification that is compatible
with the county zoning in place on the effective date of the annexation.
(Ord. 466, passed 2-22-96)

district. The determination of whether or not a use is specifically designated
shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   Building height:

§ 154-02-004 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   Single Family Residential District (R-1). To promote the
development of areas primarily devoted to single family dwelling units,
intending that all other uses be installed, operated and maintained in a manner
so as to be accessory and to compliment, or at least be of a minimum disruption
to such single family uses; also to preserve existing natural vegetation and
open areas.
      (2)   Multiple Family Residential District (R-2, R-3). To promote the
development of residential areas conducive to multi-family living, allowing a
variety of dwelling types, including apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and
other housing of a more concentrated nature than found in the single-family
districts; additionally the R-3 District provides for transitional uses that
act as a buffer to protect the character of adjoining residential areas from
nearby commercial uses.
   (B)   Residential district stipulations and provisions.
      (1)   Primary dwelling units in all residential zoning districts shall
meet the building regulations of the Town of Payson. All uses shall be
installed, operated and maintained in a manner commensurate with quiet family
living. Private, external lighting shall not create any visual intrusion onto
neighboring private or public properties. Manufactured housing units may only
be installed in zoning districts classified for Manufactured Home (MH) or
Manufactured Home Park (MHP) uses.
      (2)   Reserved
      (3)   Livestock and poultry are permitted accessory uses if they do not
create a nuisance, are in conformance to this Code, and are kept in accordance
with the following:
         (a)   A minimum of 1.0 acres of land shall be required for maintenance
of livestock or a rooster(s);
         (b)   A total of two livestock may be maintained on the first acre,
and up to one additional livestock for each additional one-half acre;
         (c)   No poultry shall be permitted in any front yard, nor shall any
horses or other livestock be maintained closer than 75 feet from any
residential unit on another lot. Where an adjacent residential lot is not
currently developed, the required setbacks on the adjacent property shall be
used to determine the potential placement of animals, animal enclosures,
corrals, etc., to ensure the 75 foot separation from horses, other livestock
and roosters.
         (d)   A maximum of ten poultry hens kept only within an enclosure or
fenced area shall be allowed on all residential lots, regardless of lot size.
         (e)   During non-daylight hours all poultry shall be confined to a
henhouse.
         (f)   Poultry shall be kept, housed, or otherwise maintained a minimum
of 25 feet from any minimum setback line on an adjacent property. Minimum
separation requirements may be waived with written agreement from affected
adjacent property owner(s).
         (g)   The keeping of poultry on any parcel not zoned R1 shall require
a zoning permit; notification as outlined in §
154-08-008(2) shall be provided. Notice shall further include any and all other
tenants/residents/users on the subject property. Approval may be subject to
administrative hearing findings and/or conditions.
         (h)   The keeping of all animals shall be subject to the regulations
and conditions of the Gila County Health Department and the Town of Payson
Animal Control Division.
         (i)   The keeping of dangerous, wild, or non-domestic animals is
prohibited.
         (j)   For the purposes of this division, the area comprising an
adjoining roadway that has been dedicated to, and accepted by, the town
pursuant to the 2003 Payson Dirt Road Improvement Project shall be included
when determining the area of any land.
      (4)   Keeping of poultry, exotic birds or other animals shall be
permitted in accordance with the "Table of Residential District Uses", in this
Code, and Gila County Health Department standards, and shall be kept in such a
manner as to not create a nuisance, nor disturb the character, as defined by
this Code, of a residential area. Exotic animals shall be kept in such a manner
to prevent any audible, physical, or other disturbance of neighbors.
      (5)   All permitted uses shall be conducted in entirely enclosed
buildings; openings in buildings for the purpose of vending or providing
services for the convenience of automotive vehicular traffic are prohibited.
      (6)   A minimum of 15% of the total gross land area of any multi-family
development shall be set aside for recreational or other common uses, in

limited commercial uses with predominance on pedestrian access and convenience
to residential neighborhoods.
      (2)   C-2 Commercial Two/General Commercial District. To accommodate the

intensive than that permitted in the C-1 District, and with emphasis on
shopping and business centers with indoor activities.
      (3)   C-3 Commercial Three/Highway Commercial District. To accommodate
the commercial and business activities that, by their nature, rely upon intense
vehicular traffic and are, therefore, most properly located along the state
highways with emphasis on providing services for both visitors and residents of

incidental storage of materials or supplies, displays (other than signs
permitted in the district), and listings shall be restricted to buildings
closed on all sides, except where otherwise permitted in this Code, and
manufactured homes shall not be used for residential or commercial purposes.
      (3)   In the C-3 District open land uses, storage of materials and
equipment, may be permitted if located beyond the front 50 feet of the lot or
parcel and screened by a continuously opaque, solid masonry wall six feet in
height, so as to render such storage or use not visible from any adjacent
properties or street; and no part of any materials or equipment may be stacked
or positioned to be higher than the screening wall.
      (4)   When any non-residential use or structure is commenced, a solid,
continuously opaque, masonry wall of six feet in height shall be constructed
along side and rear property lines adjacent to any residential zoned district,
and all requirements for screening and landscaping, as specified in §§
154-03-001 through
154-03-005, shall be installed.
      (5)   Parking and signage shall comply with the provisions of this Code.
      (6)   All residential uses shall be constructed in accordance with the
requirements applicable to residential uses in the R3 as specified in §
154-02-004.
      (7)   Prior to development of any multi-family or non-residential
project, a development master plan shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department for review; and the development plans shall be prepared
in compliance with §
154-02-007(B)(2)(b) (Planned Area Development District).
   (C)   Commercial district uses. The uses as specified in the "Table of
Commercial District Uses" in §
154-12-002 , are permitted in the district designated where a "P" (permitted)
appears in the corresponding column; uses designated with a "C" (conditional)
shall be permitted only with the approval of a conditional use permit in
accordance with the procedures set forth in §
154-09-004; where an "N" (not permitted) is designated, such use is prohibited.
   (D)   Lot development standards.
      (1)   The chart entitled "Table of Commercial Lot Development Standards",
that follows, establishes the minimum requirements for sizes of lots, dwelling
unit area, yard setbacks, space between buildings and percent of lot coverage
under roof; and establishes the standard for required connection to public
water and sewer systems.
      (2)   Commercial developments shall retain a minimum of 20% natural or
landscaped open space on the developed lot.

§ 154-02-007 PLANNED AREA DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT ("PAD").
   (A)   Purpose. The Planned Area Development (PAD) zoning district is
intended to provide an alternative to the conventional zoning and development
processes in the town in order to achieve the following purposes:
      (1)   To ensure orderly planning and review procedures that will result
in superior design, with variety in architectural and site design using
techniques including, but not limited to, variations in building styles,
setbacks, lot arrangements, and site planning;
      (2)   To promote economical, innovative, and efficient land use, with
emphasis on utilizing existing infrastructure, improving amenities, with
appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design, and sensitivity to the
surrounding land uses and the natural environment;
      (3)   To provide for a zoning district that encompasses a broad range of
land uses including, but not limited to single-family and multi-family
residential, professional and administrative offices, retail, service, hotel
and resort, light industrial or employment, recreational, and any public or
semi public use or combination of uses through the adoption of a PAD Plan which
sets forth land-use relationships, development standards, and goals consistent
with the Payson General Plan;
      (4)   To encourage a more creative approach to land utilization by
creating efficient, aesthetic, and desirable developments, which may be
characterized by incorporating special features of the geography, topography,
size, uses, or shape of a particular property into its site planning;
      (5)   To permit flexibility in design standards so that a PAD produces a
choice in the type of environment, living units, commercial installations, and
other facilities available to the public while maximizing efficient, aesthetic,
and desirable use of open space;
      (6)   To promote a unique yet compatible development that is in harmony
with the surrounding land uses and the goals of the Payson General Plan; and
      (7)   To provide a device for averaging residential density over an
entire parcel and placing less restrictions on lot size or dwelling types, as
long as the total density does not exceed the maximum approved in the PAD Plan.
   (B)   Application and procedures.
      (1)   Pre-application. The developer is required to meet with appropriate

determination as to whether the modifications will produce a quality
environment that will meet or exceed the needs of the neighborhoods within the
SPD more effectively than existing regulations.
      (5)   If the SPD encompasses residential uses, the same minimum area per
dwelling as specified in the lot development standards table for residential
district underlying the SPD, shall be used to calculate the maximum number of
dwelling units permitted, unless otherwise determined by the Council following
review of the SPD development plan.
      (6)   Lot sizes, setbacks, and building envelopes within the SPD may be
modified from those required in the lot development standards tables in this
Code in order to protect or enhance historic structures, preserve or improve
the special character of the area, to cluster buildings for the preservation of
significant native vegetation, or to create more effective use of common open
space.
      (7)   Reserved
      (8)   No SPD shall be approved unless the Council determines that it is

(Ord. 466, passed 2-22-96)
§ 154-02-013 SPECIAL PLAN DISTRICT - GREEN VALLEY REDEVELOPMENT AREA.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   Contained within the Green Valley Redevelopment Area is the
original Payson Townsite location. While this area contains nonconforming lots,
it also contains the oldest structures within the town; that have a special
historical significance for the Town of Payson.
      (2)   The Green Valley Redevelopment Area has been identified as having
several deterrents towards encouraging development within this area. These
deterrents include:
         (a)   There are significant areas included within the 100 year flood
plain.
         (b)   There are significantly higher levels of public safety calls to
this area.
         (c)   There are a significant number of legal nonconforming lots,
structure, and uses within this area.
         (d)   There are a significant number of deteriorated or dilapidated
structures within this area.
         (e)   There are a significant number of adjoining noncompatible land
uses within this area.
         (f)   There are a significant number of structures with a historical
significance.
      (3)   The issues listed above have created a situation where there is
little private investment being made into this area of town. Public roadway
infrastructure has also deteriorated into a very poor condition for most of the
roadways within this area, and in several instances there are currently
inadequate right-of-ways.
      (4)   There are several purposes for applying this overlay zoning to the
Green Valley Redevelopment Area:
         (a)   To preserve the historical significance of this area of town,
         (b)   To ensure that development standards are compatible with the
floodplain issues of this area,
         (c)   To ensure that development standards are appropriate to
development and parking restraints within this area,
         (d)   To ensure that future development is sensitive to the historical
significance of this area,
         (e)   To ensure that appropriate measures are taken to rehabilitate
some of the deteriorated or dilapidated structures within this area,
         (f)   To ensure that development occurs in a manner which provides the
highest level of public safety possible,
         (g)   To ensure that future development is sensitive to the needs of
pedestrian traffic and open space needs,
         (h)   To ensure that current and future development provide a higher
level of aesthetic value,
         (i)   To encourage more appropriate use of properties that are
currently used for outside storage of vehicles and other equipment.
      (5)   The primary principles incorporated into the design of this area
will include a pedestrian friendly environment, preservation of our historical
heritage and cultural values, adequate infrastructure to support both residents
and users, and a place which encourages people to come and gather together to
celebrate the town as a great place to live and visit.
      (6)   The following principles of "smart development" will be
incorporated into the development of the Green Valley Redevelopment Area:
         (a)   Encourage a more efficient use of land and resources,
         (b)   Encourage full use of existing urban services,
         (c)   Encourage a mix of land use activities,
         (d)   Encourage optional modes of transportation,
         (e)   Encourage a human scale in the design of development projects.
      (7)   The purpose of this section is to provide for the allowance of
modifications to currently established development standards within the Unified
Development Code. This section does not make current UDC standards totally
inapplicable. When designing a project it is important that the UDC
requirements be used as the main guide and then the following standards will
address the necessary modifications to those standards. Where modifications are
not provided for a specific development standard then the UDC will be the
guide.
   (B)   Method to apply. The Special Plan District Overlay regulations shall
be applied to the Green Valley Redevelopment Area, as defined in Ordinance No.
566 and depicted in Exhibit #1 as follows. These regulations shall apply to
applications for a building permit, rezoning request, conditional use permit,
variance, demolition request, temporary use permits, subdivisions, and minor
land divisions.

   (C)   Development standards.
      (1)   Parking requirements. Exhibit #2, attached to this Code, identifies
two areas which will require modifications to current parking regulations.
Areas not specifically designated in Exhibit #2, and development for single
family residential will not require the modifications addressed in this
section.
         (a)   Area #1 is designated as Main Street type parking. Parking
facilities will be placed to the rear of the property where feasible. A
landscaped buffer will be required to separate parking facilities from public
pedestrian facilities by at least eight feet. Parking facilities should be
screened from public pedestrian facilities with the use of berms or
landscaping.
            1.   The required number of parking spaces can be modified with the
provision of historical data or study that demonstrates a different demand than
stated in this Code. This data or study must be acceptable to the Town
Engineer.
            2.   The minimum number of required spaces can be reduced when
shared parking can be demonstrated.
            3.   Access driveways shall be designed to allow shared use where
feasible.
            4.   Deviations from any standards for the provision of parking
facilities may be granted by the Town Engineer with appropriate justification.
   Note:   Business owners will have the option of developing parking
facilities in a manner as stated in division (C)(1)(a)1. above, or pay a fee in
lieu & parking at a rate which includes the actual cost for designing,
constructing and land acquisition for the required parking space. Monies
collected shall be set aside in a special account to be used for providing
public parking.
         (b)   Area #2 shall be designated as off Main Street parking. This
area shall design their parking facilities to the side and rear of the
property. A landscaped buffer will be required to separate parking facilities
from pedestrian facilities. This buffer will be at least ten feet in width.
      (2)   Building density. The maximum lot coverage shall be no more than
65% of the lot area for lots located on Main Street. Other areas and single
family residential development shall be in accordance with the Unified
Development Code.
      (3)   Set back requirements.
         (a)   Setback requirements as specified in the UDC for R3, C1, C2, and
C3 shall not be applicable to Main Street within the Green Valley Redevelopment

within an historic district, shall utilize the current front setbacks
established, and no new structure or alteration shall extend beyond the current
front building line.
         (b)   Commercial properties which abut single family residential
development shall follow normal setback requirements in the UDC for the side or
rear yards which abut single family development.
      (4)   Space between buildings. Required space between structures shall be
designed in accordance with the current Building Code requirements, and shall
not be governed by zoning regulations within the Main Street area. This
deviation from the standard shall be applicable to commercially developed lots
on Main Street and Frontier Street.
      (5)   Outside land uses. This standard is applicable to the Historic
District or properties, Main Street, and Frontier Street. This section does not
include outside storage of equipment or supplies. Outdoor sales and displays
are prohibited, except where one or more of the following conditions are
present:
         (a)   Products and services displayed outdoors are customary,
accessory, and incidental to those sold and displayed in a primary business
being conducted in a permanent building on the property.
         (b)   Outdoor sales and displays do not interfere with pedestrian
access ways, fire lanes, required parking spaces, driveways, landscape areas,
or traffic visibility at driveway entries and street intersections.
         (c)   Special events with a temporary use permit shall be permitted.
      (6)   Outdoor sidewalk cafes. In order to enhance the Main Street
environment and complement retail and cultural activities recommended in the
Green Valley Redevelopment Area Plan, it is the policy of the town to encourage
the establishment of outdoor sidewalk cafes on private property and within
public rights-of-way. Minimum standards are established to ensure cafe design
is functionally compatible with other needs and provides for the protection of
public health, safety and welfare. Outdoor sidewalk cafes are permitted on any
public rights-of-way within the Main Street area, subject to administrative
review and compliance with the following standards:
         (a)   Outdoor sidewalk cafes must not obstruct sidewalk pedestrian
traffic or create public health and safety hazards. All sidewalks must maintain
a four foot minimum clear dimension between the outside edge of any sidewalk
and any fixed element within sidewalk right-of-way.

enclosed by means of umbrellas, awnings, canopies, or similar nonpermanent and
removable protective structure.
         (c)   A decorative barrier element separating outdoor cafe seating
area from adjacent pedestrian traffic shall be provided. The design and
materials of such barrier element must complement and be compatible with the
architectural design of the restaurant building facade.
         (d)   Enclosed outdoor cafes must be used only as seating areas.
Storage, kitchen, or rest room uses are not allowed. The seating must be
movable.

         (f)   Reserved
      (7)   Open space requirements. Natural or landscaped open space areas
shall be designed and placed in a manner which encourages pedestrian use and
comfort. Current minimum standards for open space shall not be applied to the
Green Valley Redevelopment Area.
      (8)   Maintenance.
         (a)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner and
occupant to maintain the standards established in the section. Enforcement of
these standards shall be in accordance with §§
154-10-001 through
154-10-008.
         (b)   Vacant or abandoned property shall be maintained in a clean and
well landscaped manner.
      (9)   Minimum lot size.
         (a)   Lots located on Main Street and Frontier Street and within a C-
l, C-2, or C-3 zoning district shall not be applicable to the minimum lot size
requirements of the UDC. All lots must be at least 35 feet in width.
         (b)   Single family detached and attached development within R3 zoning
districts shall be permitted to reduce lot sizes to a minimum of 4,000 square
feet per lot, with a maximum lot size of 5,000 square feet.
      (10)   Mixed residential and commercial uses. Residential and commercial
uses may be combined on a single lot in any district provided:
         (a)   The uses are only those allowed with the district in which the
lot is located;
         (b)   Unless otherwise specifically stated within the district
stipulations, each of the uses shall individually meet the space and bulk
standards set forth in the district regulations;
         (c)   Unless otherwise stated within the district regulations, each of
the uses shall individually meet the off street parking requirements of this
section;
         (d)   When residential and commercial uses are combined the standards
for multi-family development for parking shall apply; and
         (e)   On Main Street from the Beeline Highway to McLane Road no
residential development shall be permitted on the first floor fronting Main

50%.
         (b)   The accessory dwelling unit does not require additional
driveways from the street frontage.
         (c)   The inclusion of an accessory dwelling unit shall not deter from
the single family character of the area.
      (12)   Home occupations. The UDC requirements for home occupied
businesses shall be modified to allow no more than one customer or vehicle at a

Public Works Director shall comply with the objectives of the Green Valley
Redevelopment Area plan.
   (E)   Historic preservation.
      (1)   Purpose and intent. The intent of this section is to provide
protection for significant properties and sites which represent important
aspects of the Town of Payson's heritage. Protection afforded these resources
will enhance the character of the town, by taking such properties into account
during the development process, and to assist owners in the preservation,
conservation and restoration of these properties. The designation of any
property or district shall not inhibit uses as permitted by the Unified
Development Code.
      (2)   Designation criteria for districts, landmarks and properties.
         (a)   Designation of a landmark or historic property:
            1.   Meets the criteria for listing on the Arizona or National
Register of Historic Places.
            2.   The submittal is found to be of exceptional significance and
expresses a distinctive character, resulting from:
               a.   A significant portion of it is at least 50 years old; is
reflective of the town's cultural, social, political, or economic past; and is
associated with a person or event significant in local, state or national
history; or
               b.   Represents an established and familiar visual feature of an
area of the town, due to a prominent location or singular physical feature.
            3.   Local designation. Landmarks and historic properties of
special significance to the Town of Payson, but not necessarily eligible for

            4.   If it has achieved significance within the past 50 years or it
is an integral and critical part of an historic district or demonstrates
exceptional individual importance by otherwise meeting or exceeding the
criteria specified in divisions (E)(2)(a)2.a. or b. above it shall be
considered eligible for designation as a landmark. At such time as a landmark
becomes 50 years old it will automatically be reclassified as an historic
property.
         (b)   Designation of an Historic District. Criteria to establish
designation of a Historic District:
            1.   The district consists of an area in which is located a
concentration of properties, (minimum of three lots) buildings or structures
which individually meet the criteria in division (E)(2)(a) above.
            2.   District boundaries may coincide with documented historic
boundaries such as early roadways, subdivision plats or property lines.
            3.   District boundaries may coincide with logical physical or man-
made features and reflect recognized neighborhood or area boundaries.
            4.   Other noncontributing properties or vacant parcels may be
included where necessary to create appropriate boundaries or district.
            5.   A district may also include or be composed of one or more
archeological sites.
      (3)   Designation procedures for landmarks, historic properties, and
districts.

§ 154-02-014 DESIGN REVIEW.
PART I
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The purpose of design review is to encourage:
         (a)   Preservation and enhancement of property values;
         (b)   Enhancement of public safety;
         (c)   Promotion of pedestrian safety and comfort;
         (d)   Preservation of natural landscaping and significant natural
features;
         (e)   Preservation of our quality of life; and
         (f)   Enhancement of the aesthetic environment.
      (2)   The town desires to preserve the mountain, forest character of its
small, rural community and highly values:
         (a)   Natural, indigenous building materials, textures and colors that
blend with the environment and are compatible with our natural surroundings;
         (b)   Structures and layouts that compliment pedestrian systems;
         (c)   Non-contemporary, traditional western style, mountain character
building forms; and
         (d)   Native landscaping and preservation of significant features,
such as mature tree growth, rock outcrops, and view sheds.
   (B)   Vision and goals.
      (1)   The design review process is intended to provide the town with an
orderly aesthetic growth pattern in keeping with the cultural and historic
foundations of the Town of Payson. Indigenous building materials used by the
prehistoric builders and early settlers in the Payson region included the use
of the abundant stone and wood timber of the area. These natural materials
remain a favorite for use in construction within our community today, thus
providing an aesthetic bridge between the past and our promising future as we
continue to grow at the edge of the world's largest Ponderosa Pine forest.
      (2)   The goals of design review include:
         (a)   Preservation of the mountain, forest character and heritage of
the Town of Payson;
         (b)   Encourage the use of non-contemporary, rustic style buildings;
         (c)   Ensuring development is appropriate in terms of scale within the
town and relative to the vicinity of the site.

 Development Guidelines                                                       
 
All proposals should strive to meet the vision and goals of design review and
address the appropriate design principles. Development guidelines help ensure
the established design principles are incorporated into each project and that
all new development contributes to the design review vision.
   (C)   Design principles. Payson's design principles are centered around the
belief that development should respect the unique climate, topography,
vegetation and historical context of Payson's natural forest and mountain
environment. These characteristics help sustain our community, its
attractiveness as a tourist destination, and its quality of life. These design
principles are the essence of and foundation for the guidelines described in
this Design Review Manual.
      (1)   Architectural character.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/564a1af46368ad7d85a8140da25f0716df8c1487/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2783.jpg]
Building style should reflect Payson's mountain look and western heritage.
Structures should enhance the human level of commercial developments and
respect the scale and character of the town and adjoining areas.
Materials should compliment the mountain, forest environment through the use of
abundant stone and wood.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/564a1af46368ad7d85a8140da25f0716df8c1487/

Natural, subdued, mountain brown and forest green colors are encouraged.
On painted structures, contrast between trim and body colors is encouraged.
Palette and colors should reflect the predominant natural subdued color of the
mountains and the forest.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2793.jpg]
      (2)   Site character. The use of good site planning and design, landscape
architecture and civil engineering that enhances the existing and future
appearance of development areas is highly valued.
Development and layout of buildings at this site (right) preserved the stand of
existing Ponderosa Pine trees in a meaningful open space area, which also
doubles as a detention area.

564a1af46368ad7d85a8140da25f0716df8c1487/IMAGES/0-0-0-2795.jpg]
Areas for retention or detention should maintain existing native plants on the
site and be landscaped with appropriate materials and integrated into the
overall design and layout of the development.
   Encouraged            Discouraged

IMAGES/0-0-0-2799.jpg]
A strong pedestrian connection should be provided from the building to public
walkways, and area wide Payson Area Trails System, where applicable.
Walkways should be defined to provide clear, convenient routes through parking
lots to building entrances.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/564a1af46368ad7d85a8140da25f0716df8c1487/

IMAGES/0-0-0-2803.jpg]
The pedestrian ways shown (left) link adjacent developments and connect to
public trails and walkways.
Meandering sidewalks are preferred over rigid, straight alignments.
All development proposals should coordinate pedestrian and vehicular
circulation patterns with adjacent buildings and sites.
Shared access drives are encouraged to minimize curb cuts.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/564a1af46368ad7d85a8140da25f0716df8c1487/

Lots shown (above) have coordinated their layout to maintain continuity of
parking areas and building orientation, and also to create more significant
natural areas.
Lots shown (right) share a common drive, reducing the number of curb cuts along
the street and also share parking and trash enclosure.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2807.jpg]
Placement of roads and driveways that follow natural topography wherever
possible is encouraged to minimize cutting and grading.
Mechanical equipment, loading/unloading areas and utility areas should be
screened and located in an area of the site not readily viewed by the public.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/564a1af46368ad7d85a8140da25f0716df8c1487/

Dark-sky principles should govern the design of all site lighting and signage.
Care should be taken to minimize the amount of light spill from structures,
including spill from skylights and windows.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/564a1af46368ad7d85a8140da25f0716df8c1487/

IMAGES/0-0-0-2813.jpg]
Unacceptable fixtures do not obscure the source of illumination allowing for
glare and light trespass.
      (3)   Landscaping. Landscaping should be integral to the overall design
concept and should be carefully planned to serve more than one purpose. The
landscape design should contribute to the overall appearance and function of
the site as well as the streetscape.
Development should enhance the beauty of the landscape by the preservation of
significant natural topographic features, such as rock outcroppings, mature
native trees and plants, and floodplains or drainage ways.

Vision
Historic old town Payson "Main Street" was the unique area of 1890-1930's
Payson center of commerce and social activity. With this significant history,
it is the intent and vision of these guidelines to encourage a rebirth, with
economic vitality to the historic Main Street's pre-1930's era aesthetic and
spirit of old Payson.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2841.jpg]
Purpose
The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure development is in harmony with the
vision of old town Payson's historic "Main Street" as a destination experience.
This will be accomplished through new and remodeled pre 1930's building
facades, pedestrian and retail-friendly streetscapes with tree-lined boulevards
and land planning that promotes this special sense of place. Building facades,
street furniture, landscaping, public and private graphics, all with historic
Main Street era elements will encourage this rebirth of Payson's Historic "Main
Street."

   Historic Main Street Design Review Area
Architectural Character
      (1)   Building style.
         (a)   Suitability of the building for its location on Historic Main
Street will be considered.
         (b)   Buildings shall reflect historic old Main Street era design and
shall be compatible with adjacent structures and the intent and purpose of
these regulations.
         (c)   In the areas of restoration/rehabilitation concealing of the
original facade should be avoided.
         (d)   Overhead structures, with a minimum of eight feet vertical
clearance are required on the facade of the ground floor. Overhead structures
are architectural features incorporated into the building facade, an
embellishment of the building that provides visual interest, shade, and
pedestrian comfort and protection. Overhead structures should be used to
incorporate historic old Main Street era architecture. (See Appendix D)
         (e)   The architectural design shall be historically themed and shall
be compatible with the historic area aesthetic. Design compatibility shall
include complimentary building style, form, scale, size, colors and materials.
         (f)   Diversity of architectural design of that pre-1930's traditional
Main Street era is encouraged. (See examples Appendix D)
         (g)   Reveals are encouraged at all doorways and windows that front on
Main Street. Reveals are also encouraged at side and rear walls visible from
Main Street.
      (2)   Materials.

occupancy dictates, a lesser percentage may be considered by the Design Review
Board.
      (5)   Signage:
         (a)   All new and replacement signs within the Historic Main Street
corridor shall promote the image of historic Main Street, approximately 1890
through 1930, when Main Street was the center of commerce in Payson. By
recreating the visual impact of the graphics of the time at an affordable cost,
the street image will change without incurring the more costly, in both time
and dollars, building facade replacements or new developments. Town of Payson
standardized street signs, public information signs and address signs as well
as the individual private business signs shall be designed and installed to
promote the early 1900's streetscape graphic visual. (See examples Appendix D)
         (b)   Oversized Historic Main Street signs will be considered on a
case by case basis. Photographic historical examples submitted with the
applicant's proposal will weigh in the evaluation of the applicant's proposed
oversized signs. Maximum increase in the size of an oversized sign is 100%.
         (c)   Boomtown facades with an oversized sign field are encouraged.
         (d)   Shed roof covered walkways with individual proprietor's signs
are encouraged. Several examples of this aesthetic and graphics are evidenced
in historical photographs. (See Appendix D)
         (e)   All new signs should utilize the Payson area indigenous stone,
and/or wood aesthetic to the greatest degree feasible. The sign supports, field
materials and colors should reflect the mountain forest environment with bright
colors limited to use in the graphics.
         (f)   All new building signs shall be applied on, affixed to, or
supported by the "front" street facing facade of the building only. Other sign
types/styles considered will be freestanding monument signs, freestanding pole/
arm placard signs, and temporary portable event signs.
         (g)   Prohibited sign materials/components include neon, vacuum-
formed, and internally illuminated or back-lit light cans.
      (6)   Colors. (No additional requirements - see Part IV, division (A).)

§ 154-02-015 AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the Airport Overlay Zone (AO) is to
protect the public health and safety in the area of an airport by minimizing
exposure to crash hazards and high noise levels that may be generated by the
operations of an airport and to encourage future compatible development for the
continued operation of the airport.
   (B)   Airport zones. The zones in this section include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Payson Municipal Airport. These zones are
shown on Payson Zoning Map consisting of two sheets, prepared by the town,
dated June 1990. An area located in more than one of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      (1)   Utility runway visual approach zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (2)   Utility runway non-precision instrument approach zone. The inner
edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (3)   Heliport approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 100 feet wide. The
approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 500 feet at a horizontal
distance of 4,000 feet from the primary surface.
      (4)   Transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.
      (5)   Heliport transitional zones extend outward from the sides of the
primary surface and the heliport approach zones a horizontal distance of 250
feet from the primary surface centerline and the heliport approach zone
centerline.
      (6)   The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet
radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and
connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The
horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
      (7)   The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the
periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal
distance of 4,000 feet.
   (C)   Airport zone height limitations. The height of all construction,
structures, buildings and landscaping in the following zones shall be limited
by the lesser of the allowable height under §
154-02-003 (Building Heights) and the height limitations set forth below:
      (1)   Utility runway visual approach zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
      (2)   Utility runway non-precision instrument approach zone. Slopes 20
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
      (3)   Heliport approach zone. Slopes eight feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface
and extending to a distance of 4,000 feet along the heliport approach zone
centerline.
      (4)   Transitional zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation, 5,307 feet above mean sea level. In addition, height limits shall
include sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides
of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, extending to where they
intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach
zone projects beyond the conical zone, height limits shall include sloping
seven feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the sides of and at the
same elevation as the approach surface and extending a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet measured at 90 degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
      (5)   Heliport transitional zones. Slope two feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as primary surface
and heliport approach zones, extending a distance of 250 feet measured
horizontally from and at 90 degree angles to the primary surface centerline and
heliport approach zones centerline.
      (6)   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation or at a height of 5,307 feet above mean sea level.
      (7)   Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
      (8)   Height limitations. Prior to the construction of any structure
within 1,200 feet of the nearest point on the airport runway, the developer of
such structure shall notify the Federal Aviation Administration, as prescribed
in FAA part 77-D. Proof of such notification and Federal Aviation
Administration approval of such construction shall be required prior to the
town issuing any building, grading, or other development permits.
   (D)   Use restrictions. No use may be made of land within any zone
established by this section in such a manner as to create electrical
interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the
airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the
airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, increase probability
of bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the
landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
   (E)   Nonconforming uses.
      (1)   The provisions of this section shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree
not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date of this Code, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of legally existing nonconforming use.
      (2)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree shall
be required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance of markers
and lights as deemed necessary by the airport manager to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such
airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and
maintained at the expense of the town.
   (F)   Administration. Lots divided by special use airport zone boundary:
Whenever a lot of record is divided by an airport boundary, the development
shall conform to the land use and height restrictions contained in this Code.
   (G)   Permits.
      (1)   No material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure
shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any
zone designated in this section, unless a special permit has been granted by
the town, unless otherwise provided for in this section. Each application for a
special permit shall indicate the purpose for the use and how it will comply
with this Code.
         (a)   In the area between the horizontal and conical zones, a special
permit shall not be required for the placement of any tree or structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
         (b)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, a
special permit shall not be required for any tree or structure less than 75
feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure
would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
         (c)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, a special permit shall not be
required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above
the ground, except when such tree or structure, would extend above the height
limit prescribed for such transition zones.
      (2)   Existing uses. No special permit shall be granted that would allow
the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this Code.
      (3)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 50% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from this Code.
      (4)   Variances. The application for variance in an Airport Overlay
District shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this Code. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this Code may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a
copy of the application has been furnished to the airport manager for advice as
to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager does not
respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Board of
Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
      (5)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted
may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Code
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the town at its own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain the necessary markings and lights.

§ 154-03-003 TREE PRESERVATION.
   (A)   Preservation of native trees, water conservation and site orientation
incentives.
      (1)   Where dense stands of mature trees, (all trees over six inches in
diameter measured four and one-half feet above the ground, and spaced no more
than 20 feet apart) are preserved over 35% or more of the property proposed for
development or expansion, no additional landscaping materials will be required,
provided that a portion of the preserved mature trees are located in the front
and street side yards in a manner as to present the image of natural open space
expressed in §
154-03-001(A), the purpose and applicability section. Such determination shall
be made by the Zoning Administrator and in no case shall there be less than ten
feet in width of landscaped area along any street frontage.
      (2)   Other incentives that may be used for the preservation of mature
native trees, if appropriate for achieving the screening and landscaping of
parking lots, and approved by the Zoning Administrator, are as follows:
         (a)   Up to 10% of the required standard parking spaces may be reduced
to 8' X 16' for compact cars and so labeled, for parking lots of 20 spaces or
more;
         (b)   The number of required parking spaces may be reduced up to 10%
for parking lots of 20 spaces or more; or
         (c)   The developer may select option (a) or (b) as shown above with
the approval of the Zoning Administrator, and shall comply with the
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other parking lot
regulations of this Code.
      (3)   If existing trees, six inches or more in diameter measured at four
and one-half feet above the ground, are removed from the area outside of the
building envelope, at least one tree of 15 gallon size shall be planted on-site
or off-site in an approved public location.
      (4)   Where necessary to preserve important existing natural features and
prominent stands of mature native trees, the Zoning Administrator may approve
minor modifications from the building setbacks required by the Code, but in no
case shall there be less than ten feet of landscaped setback along any street
frontage.
      (5)   For multi-family, manufactured home and recreational vehicle parks,
or other grouped residential developments, densities may be traded from
portions of the development site which contain dense, mature trees and native
vegetation and which will be preserved, to portions of the development site
which are void of these natural, prominent features.
      (6)   Where buildings are sited at the front area of the lot with parking
and driveways at the sides and rear of the lot to create easy access for
emergency vehicles around the sides and rear of the building, the building
front setback may be reduced by 50% as long as a minimum of ten feet of
landscaped area is installed or preserved between the building and its property
line and landscaping is provided in the street right-of way areas.
   (B)   Tree and plant conservation plan. The purpose of this guideline is to
provide a means for selecting trees and plants that may be protected in place,
salvaged or mitigated in order to conserve this living resource. It is
imperative that the native vegetation in the town be preserved to the greatest
extent practicable and in the case of tree removal, efforts should be made to
mitigate unnecessary loss of native vegetation.
      (1)   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all
new subdivisions, and lots designated for commercial or industrial use, except
for building envelopes on residential lots that are identified on approved
final plats.
      (2)   Plant selection procedure. Conduct an inventory of estimated live
native trees of greater than six inch diameter at the four and one-half feet
level to be removed from the site outside of building envelopes, and list these
by species or common name, type, general location and count and include the
following:
         (a)   Identify any species found that are protected pursuant to the
Arizona Native Plant Law (A.R.S. §§ 3-901, et seq.), and species protected by
the Federal Endangered Species Act;
         (b)   Note species that provide significant aesthetic or historical
qualities.
         (c)   Identify plants that constitute a hazard, such as brush fire
potential or disease.
         (d)   Identify invasive species that may have a negative effect on the
native plants.
         (e)   Identify plants that may provide a resource value, such as
lumber.
      (3)   Tree conservation plan.
         (a)   Identify the amount and location of trees greater than six
inches in diameter at four and one-half feet height outside the building
envelope that are scheduled to be protected in place, salvaged, or destroyed.
         (b)   Describe plans for disposition of trees and plants, with
scheduling.
         (c)   Describe the sale or donation of plants to public or private
agencies or individuals for salvage and landscaping.
         (d)   Prepare a mitigation plan for compensation of loss of
significant vegetation, including erosion control, aesthetics and other
considerations.
         (e)   Identify plants to be destroyed or removed to reduce a hazard or
nuisance.
         (f)   Identify use of plant materials for other resource uses, such as
lumber or wood chips.
         (g)   Prepare a course of action to implement the plan.

   (A)   The provisions of this section shall apply to all land uses in all
zoning districts, except for the building footprint and an area of five feet
from this footprint. The trees within the building and the five foot area can
be removed after an approved building permit has been issued. A separate tree
permit for removal is not required.
   (B)   No person, entity or corporation in any zoning district shall remove,
cause to be removed, destroy or injure any native tree with a diameter of six
inches or greater, measured four and one-half feet above ground level, from an
undeveloped or developed parcel of land without first obtaining a tree permit
from the Building Department and approved by the Zoning Administrator, or
designee, except where necessary for construction of streets, driveways,
utility poles, and structures approved in a Town of Payson building permit, for
the removal of trees, shall be issued.
      (1)   Prior to any permit being issued for the removal of a native tree
or trees, the applicant shall provide a detailed written explanation of why the
tree or trees need to be cut or removed.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may also require submission of accurate
photos and a diagram, plotting the tree or trees to be removed and those to
remain, plus details of the proposed methods of controlling soil erosion,
maintaining drainage, and abating dust problems.
      (3)   The applicant shall provide sufficient information and details to
enable the Zoning Administrator to review the tree removal permit application.
      (4)   If the Zoning Administrator is satisfied that the applicant's
proposal furthers the public welfare, or is not detrimental to the subject
parcel or adjoining parcels, and is in accordance with the provisions of this
Code, the permit shall be issued.
   (C)   Any decision of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the
Planning and Zoning Commission and to the Council for final review and action.
On applications concerning commercial properties or multi-family, the Zoning
Administrator may hold public hearings to provide public input prior to
rendering his decision. In no event shall more than 45 days elapse between the
date the completed application is submitted and the date the final decisions of
the Zoning Administrator are rendered.

permitted unless parking requirements of this Code are met for the entire
building or use.
   (K)   In the case of mixed use, the total requirements for off-street

dedicated to the public or reserved for acquisition by the public within a
specified period of time. An agreement shall be reached between the subdivider
and the appropriate public agency regarding time, method, and cost of such
acquisition.
      (3)   Property which is within a delineated floodway or flood plain, or
known to have major drainage issues shall not be subdivided until the drainage
issues have been adequately addressed. Thereafter, improvement plans shall be
approved by the appropriate local, state and federal agencies and construction
financial assurances shall be posted prior to commencement of construction.
      (4)   Whenever new lots, tracts or parcels are created that have a slope
of 15% or greater over at least one-half of the new lot, tract, or parcel,
development shall meet the requirements of division (H) of this section. A
slope analysis map shall be submitted with or prior to the preliminary plat
showing all areas with a slope greater than 15%.
      (5)   Minimum lot width, depth and area standards may be modified if a
Development Master Plan is submitted and approved by the Planning Commission
concurrently with a Preliminary Plat application. The number of housing units
proposed in a Development Master Plan shall not exceed the gross density
allowed by the zoning district in which the subdivision is located.
   (B)   Street location and arrangement.
      (1)   Whenever a property to be subdivided is adjacent to or embraces any
part of an existing street or any future street designated in an adopted town
transportation or circulation plan, such street shall be platted and
constructed with the subdivision in conformance with the classification and
standards designated for that street.
      (2)   Street layout shall provide for the continuation of streets to
promote connectivity throughout the town.
      (3)   New streets in a proposed subdivision shall be extended to the
property boundary to provide future connection with adjoining unsubdivided
properties. Street connections shall be designed to accommodate the amount of
increased traffic flow generated by the proposed subdivision. An engineered
traffic study to determine the effect of the increased traffic may be required
by the Public Works Department.
      (4)   No residential lot access is allowed from arterial or minor
arterial roadways.
      (5)   Streets shall be arranged in relation to existing topography to
produce desirable lots of maximum utility, streets of reasonable gradient, and
to facilitate adequate drainage. Local streets shall be arranged to discourage
their use by through traffic.
      (6)   Alleys are discouraged. However, alleys may be provided in the
platting process if needed to provide adequate vehicular or utility access to
the proposed properties. If alleys are used, special attention shall be given
to utility placement and access, drainage, and crime prevention.
      (7)   Half streets are discouraged. However, half streets may be allowed
to provide right-of-way required by the circulation element of the General Plan
or recommended in the Payson Area Traffic Study, to complete an existing street
pattern, or to assure reasonable development of adjoining parcels.
         (a)   When a development is required to construct a new roadway along
a boundary, the developer shall work with the adjacent property owner to
provide full street improvements. If an agreement cannot be reached to
construct the full street, the town may approve a half street. However, the
development may need to dedicate additional right-of-way to accommodate the
minimum half street.
         (b)   The minimum paved street width of a half street is 20.5 feet
(back of curb to edge of pavement).
         (c)   Where a new development abuts an existing half street, the
remaining half street shall be constructed with the new development.
      (8)   Where a new single family residential subdivision abuts an existing
non-single family use, either by use or zoning classification, the subdivision
shall construct screening between the new subdivision and the non-single family
uses.
   (C)   Street design. All public and private streets in the town, unless
otherwise specified in this Code, shall be designed to the standards set forth
herein.
Table C.1.1 summarizes the street design requirements.
      (1)   The following minimum required right-of-way widths shall be
followed unless a reduction is specifically approved by the Public Works
Department and the Town Council. A reduced right-of-way may be granted only if
special accommodations have been made for utilities, access, parking, grading
and drainage.
         (a)   Major arterial streets and highways - as required by current
town and Arizona Department of Transportation standards.
         (b)   Minor arterial street right-of-way - 80 feet.
         (c)   Collector street right-of-way - 60 feet.
         (d)   Local street right-of-way - 50 feet.
         (e)   Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular right-of-way 50
feet in radius with an improved traffic turning circle 45 feet in radius. An
equally convenient turnaround acceptable to the Fire Department may be approved
by the Public Works Department where justified by the field conditions.
      (2)   Dead end streets will not be approved except in locations where
they will provide access to adjacent property for future development. Any dead
end street providing access to more than four lots or more than 150 feet long,
measured from the intersecting street right-of-way to the end of the road,
shall provide a temporary turnaround meeting the requirements of division (C)
(1)(e) of this section.
      (3)   Alleys, if used, shall be a minimum width of 20 feet. All half
width alleys shall have a minimum width of 12 feet. Alley intersections and
sharp changes in alignment shall have a minimum 15' by 15' triangular cutoff on
each quadrant. Alleys shall be tangential if the centerline radius is less than
800 feet. Dead end alleys are prohibited.
      (4)   Grades. Longitudinal slopes (grade) of streets shall be in
accordance with
Table C.1.1 and the accompanying notes. Exceptions to street grade requirements
may be approved by the Public Works Director in extreme conditions.
      (5)   Vertical curves. Vertical curves shall be in accordance with
Table C.1.1 and the accompanying notes.
      (6)   Horizontal alignment.
         (a)   Horizontal alignment shall be in accordance with
Table C.1.1 and the accompanying notes.
         (b)   When tangent center lines deflect from each other more than five
degrees and less than 90 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve per
Table C.1.1.
         (c)   Streets intersecting with minor arterial routes shall do so at
an angle which shall not vary from 90 degrees by more than six degrees;
intersections of local streets shall not vary from 90 degrees by more than ten
degrees.
         (d)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall
be avoided unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Department.
         (e)   Minor streets intersecting a collector street or arterial route
shall have a tangent section of centerline at least 150 feet in length measured
from the right-of-way line of the major street; except that, no such tangent is
required when the minor street curve has a centerline radius greater than 400
feet with the center located on the major street right-of-way line. Where
topographic conditions make necessary other treatment to secure the best
overall design, these standards may be modified by the Public Works Department.
         (f)   Street intersections with more than four legs and Y-type
intersections where legs meet at acute angles shall be avoided.
         (g)   At street intersections, property line corners shall be rounded
by circular arc, said arc having a minimum radius length of 15 feet on arterial
and collector streets and a minimum radius of 12 feet on local streets.

TABLE C.1.1 NOTES
1.   All principal arterial routes are state highways owned and maintained by
the Arizona Department of Transportation.
2.   Vertical curb and gutter may be required if storm drainage flows cannot be
contained within the roll curb and gutter.
3.   Sidewalk may be required on only one side of the road with and increased
width (6' minimum) if approved by the Public Works Department and Community
Development Department (See Note 4).
4.   A minimum 4 foot wide shoulder is required if no sidewalk is installed.
This shoulder shall maintain the same grade as sidewalk would be and shall be
constructed of ABC, granite or other approved material.
5.   Asphaltic concrete thickness shall be as recommended in the geotechnical
report for each project or the specified minimum, whichever is greater. If
Portland Cement concrete is used, the minimum thickness shall be as recommended
in the projects geotechnical report. A double chip seal may also be used only
on roads included in the "Dirt Road Elimination Program".
6.   Roadway Base thickness to be as recommended in the geotechnical report for
each project or the specified minimum, whichever is greater. No ABC is required
if a full depth asphalt or Portland Cement concrete alternative section as
recommended in the geotechnical report is used.
7.   A maximum longitudinal slope of up to 18% may be used for a distance not
to exceed 300 feet between the vertical points of intersection if existing
terrain dictates and approved by the Public Works Department.
8.   The tangent between reverse curves may be reduced to 50 feet if the
centerline radius on each end of the tangent exceeds 750 feet.
9.   The tangent between reverse curves may be reduced to 50 feet if the
centerline radius on each end of the tangent exceeds 250 feet and may be
eliminated if the centerline radius on each end of the tangent exceeds 750 feet
if approved by the Public Works Department.
10.   These standards are designed for new roadway construction. These
standards may be adjusted on projects involving rehabilitation of existing
improvements if approved by the Public Works Department.

   (D)   Block design.
      (1)   Maximum length of blocks, measured along the centerline of the
street, and between intersecting street centerlines, shall be 1,500 feet. The
maximum length may be increased to 2,000 feet in areas where the average lot
size is one-half acre or larger.
      (2)   The length of cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 600 feet measured
from the intersection of the street center lines to the center of the cul-de-
sac bubble or turnaround, measured along the street centerline. This length may
be extended where topography, adjacent platting or other unusual conditions
justify such. No exception shall be made merely because the tract has
restrictive boundary dimensions. Where a street is intended to serve adjacent
properties in the future, this length may be exceeded and a temporary turn
around installed per division (C)(1)(e) of this section.
      (3)   The maximum number of lots that may be served by a single point of
access shall be in accordance with the International Fire Code adopted by the
town, including but not limited to, Appendix D, Section D107 of such Code. A
gated emergency access may be considered as an additional point of access, if
approved pursuant to the International Fire Code and by the Community
Development Department and the Public Works Department.
      (4)   Pedestrian ways with a minimum right-of-way of ten feet may be
required where necessary for pedestrian or equestrian access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, trails, the National Forest,
etc. Pedestrian ways may be used as public utility corridors.
   (E)   Lot planning.
      (1)   General information.
         (a)   Lot width, depth, and area shall comply with the minimum zoning
requirements for the zoning district in which it is located.
         (b)   In areas of steep topography, unusual soil conditions, drainage
issues, abrupt changes in land use or where heavy traffic on adjacent streets
prevail, special lot width, depth, and area requirements which exceed the
minimum requirements of the particular zoning district may be required.
      (2)   Proposed streets shall be arranged in close relation to existing
topography.
      (3)   The depth-to-width ratio of the usable area of the lot shall not be
greater than three to one.
      (4)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines, except where other treatment is justified and approved by the
town.
      (5)   Lot access shall be on a public or private street and in accordance
with §
154-02-003(A)(4).
      (6)   Single family residential lots extending through the block and
having frontage on two parallel streets are discouraged. If allowed, through
lots shall have a one foot non-vehicular access easement and a physical barrier
across the rear of the lot.
   (F)   Easement planning.
      (1)   A minimum eight foot wide public utility easement shall be provided
along all street frontages for use by all utilities.
      (2)   Drainage flows exiting any parcel, tract, or lot shall enter a
natural drainage conveyance, drainage easement, or public right-of-way.
Drainage easements are required wherever drainage flows leave the public right-
of-way. Drainage easements shall be of sufficient width to allow adequate
maintenance as approved by the Public Works Department.
      (3)   Land within a public street or drainage easement or land within a
utility easement for major power transmission (tower) lines or pipe lines shall
not be considered a part of the minimum required lot area except where lots
exceed one-half acre in area. This shall not be construed as applicable to land
involved in utility easements for distribution or service purposes.
      (4)   Additional easements may be required wherever slopes, utilities, or
drainage facilities are not included within the road rights-of-way.
   (G)   Street naming. The subdivider shall propose the street names subject
to the approval by the Police, Fire, Public Works and Community Development
Departments at the preliminary plat stage.
   (H)   Hillside properties.
      (1)   Applicability.
         (a)   These regulations shall apply to all properties with a slope of
15% or greater on 50% or more of the total lot area. (Note: Properties or
parcels established prior to August 8, 1999 are not required to conform to this
section, unless that parcel or property has since been reconfigured by a lot
line adjustment, minor land division, subdivision plat or similar process.)
         (b)   A property is exempt from the requirements of this section if
all of the following items are complied with:
            1.   The lot line adjustment map, minor land division map or
subdivision plat depict an allowable restricted building envelope on the
property that is substantially more restrictive than the standard building
setback areas;
            2.   The area of slope greater than 15% within the restricted
building envelope is less than 50% of the restricted building envelope; and
            3.   The restricted building envelope is not adjusted to increase
the 15% or greater slope area of the restricted building envelope to more than
50% of the restricted building envelope.
         (c)   This exemption may be applied to properties previously
designated as "hillside lots" if the submitted building plans and site grading
plans show that the disturbed area fits within a restricted building envelope
meeting the above criteria.
      (2)   Development policies. The following general development policies
shall be used for developing all properties on which the hillside regulations
apply:
         (a)   All vegetation, including plants, trees and grasses shall be
preserved to the best extent possible to reduce scarring, storm water runoff,
and preservation of the natural environment.
         (b)   Buildings and other structures shall be designed with terracing-
like features which follow the original contours of the site thereby
discouraging high protruding structures which will dominate hillside areas and
negatively impact the scenic quality. Where possible, structures are to be
constructed so that the roof lines are below ridge lines.
         (c)   Grading shall be kept to a minimum, attempting to conform to the
natural contours of the land, and sharp angles at the top and ends of cut and
fill slopes shall be rounded in a natural manner.
         (d)   Replacement vegetation shall be planted on all cut and fill
slopes to prevent erosion and enhance the natural beauty.
         (e)   Natural drainage ways shall be preserved to the best extent
reasonable.
         (f)   Geological formations, such as rock outcrops, shall be preserved
whenever reasonable.
         (g)   Utilities and other infrastructure necessary for development
will be installed in a manner and location which protects and preserves
hillside areas.
      (3)   Determination of slope percentage and area.
         (a)   The location of the 15% and greater slopes shall be determined
by a computer slope analysis program using software approved by the Town of
Payson Town Engineer. The area of slope of 15% or greater shall be determined
for each parcel, tract or lot created. If the area of 15% or greater slope
exceeds 50% of the total parcel, tract or lot area, that property shall be
considered a "hillside" property and shall be developed in accordance with the
requirements of this section.
         (b)   Manmade areas of disturbance in place prior to the property
potentially being designated as a "hillside" property may be ignored when
calculating the area of slope over 15% if approved by the Public Works
Department.
      (4)   Development standards and regulations for single family residential
properties 8,000 square feet or larger. The development standards regulations
in this section are for 8,000 square foot and larger single family residential
properties. Development standards and regulations for smaller single family,
multi-family, and commercial properties are in division (H)(7) of this section.
         (a)   Clearing and grubbing. No clearing, grubbing or brushing is
allowed on "hillside" properties without a grading permit.
         (b)   Grading.
            1.   Grading is any excavation or embankment or combination
thereof.
            2.   The amount of area allowed to be disturbed on a "hillside"
property, excluding the disturbed area under a roof, open deck or porch, and
the driveway surface area, shall be no more than 10% of the total lot area.
            3.   An engineered grading and drainage plan shall be prepared and
sealed by an Arizona registered professional duly licensed to prepare such
plans by the Arizona State Board of Technical Registration for each "hillside"
property in accordance with these requirements and the requirements of the Town
of Payson Grading and Drainage Manual. This plan shall be approved by the Town
of Payson Town Engineer prior to the issuance of a building permit and prior to
any type of brushing or grading proceeding on the property.
            4.   The engineered grading and drainage plan shall include at a
minimum the following information:
               a.   Existing topography including contour lines, trees 6" in
diameter at 4.5' above the ground, major geologic features, adjacent roadway
and improvements, existing utilities, etc. Also include the location of any
existing disturbance on a "hillside" property in conjunction with the
construction of roadways, drainage facilities, utilities, etc. for an overall
development.
               b.   Proposed elevations of all constructed items and grading
such as finished floor (FF), all finish grades, driveways, walkways, retaining
walls, etc.
               c.   Location of all proposed structures, decks, underground
utility service lines, retaining walls, walkways, driveways, curbs, hand
railings, fences, slopes, and similar related items.
               d.   A calculation showing the amount of allowable graded area
of the lot, the amount of disturbed area excluded from the grading
calculations, and the disturbed area outside the excluded area.
               e.   A line on the grading plan shall depict the maximum limits
of disturbance of the property. A temporary fence, 3' high minimum, shall be
constructed on the property coincident with the maximum limits of disturbance

it may be impractical to meet the above requirements. At the sole discretion of
the Town of Payson Town Engineer, if it is impractical to stay within the 10%
disturbed area limits, any one or combination of the following options may be
used to approve the grading plan:
         (a)   Disturbed areas caused in conjunction with the construction of
roadways, drainage facilities, utilities, etc. for the overall development may
be declared exempt from the amount of allowable disturbed area of the parcel.
         (b)   Additional area in excess of the allowable 10% disturbed area
may be allowed if the additional disturbed area is landscaped to the following
requirements: Two trees (15 gallon minimum with a minimum trunk diameter of 2")
and eight shrubs (five gallon minimum size) per each 500 square feet of
disturbed area.
         (c)   Allow credit for construction of driveways, walk ways or similar
type construction that disturbs substantially less area than would normally be

plan, the Public Works Department shall approve of the certificate of
occupancy. If during the final inspection of the grading and drainage it is
determined that the field construction is not in accordance with the approved
plan, the Public Works Department may exercise any or all of the following
options:
         (a)   Require remedial action to bring the field grading and drainage
into compliance with the approved plan;
         (b)   Require an "as-built" plan, including updated disturbed area
calculations, to determine if the field conditions are in compliance with all
the requirements of this section. If it is determined from the "as-built" plan
that the construction on a particular property is not in compliance with these
requirements, the registered professional shall prepare a revised design to
bring the property into compliance. Upon approval by the town of the revised
plan, all construction must be completed on the property prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.

districts that can be designed and developed in a manner which assures maximum
compatibility with adjoining uses.
      (3)   It is the purpose of this section to establish principles and
procedures essential to proper guidance and control of such uses. Conditional
uses shall be compatible with land uses permitted in a zoning district, and may

   (C)   Standards of review. To ensure that the proposed use will be
compatible with the surrounding area, to ensure the provision of the
appropriate off-site improvements and that any modification of the development
plan imposed by the Commission will be complied with, a conditional use permit
shall be issued only when the Commission finds that the applicant has
adequately addressed the following:
      (1)   Access and traffic; pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular circulation.
      (2)   Noise, light, visual, litter and other pollutants.
      (3)   Buffering provisions.

TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS
§ 154-13-001 TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS.
   (A)   Findings. The Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("the Act") grants the Federal Communications
Commissions (FCC) exclusive jurisdiction over:
      (1)   The regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF)
emissions from telecommunication facilities; and
      (2)   The regulation of radio signal interference among users of the RF
spectrum. Note: The regulation of towers and telecommunication facilities
within the Town of Payson shall not have the effect of prohibiting any person
from providing wireless telecommunications services in violation of the Act.
   (B)   Purpose. The general purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the
placement, construction, and modification of towers and telecommunication
facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public,
while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the
competitive wireless telecommunications market place. Specific purposes
include:
      (1)   To regulate the location of towers and telecommunication
facilities;
      (2)   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of towers and telecommunication facilities;
      (3)   To minimize adverse visual impact of towers and telecommunication
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
      (4)   To promote and encourage shared use/co-locations of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single use towers;
      (5)   To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new tower structures
to support antenna and telecommunication facilities;
      (6)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and
telecommunication facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound; and
      (7)   To ensure that towers and telecommunication facilities are
compatible with surrounding land uses.
   (C)   Town owned property. The Town Council reserves the exclusive right to
establish all restrictions necessary or appropriate for the protection of the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the town, on any towers or
telecommunication facilities placed on town owned property.
      (1)   The contract between the town and an applicant for the placement of
a tower or telecommunication facility on town owned property shall determine
the restrictions relating to the tower(s) and/or telecommunication facilities.
      (2)   Applicants for towers on town property shall complete a citizen
participation plan and report as outlined in §
154-09-013 and
154-09-014.
      (3)   The Town Council shall use the provisions of this subchapter and
the citizen participation report as a guide when establishing such
restrictions. All the provisions of the UDC, except this subchapter, shall
apply to the placement of towers on town property.
(Ord. 466, passed 2-22-96)

line.
      (2)   Setback requirements for towers shall be measured from the base of
the tower to the property line of the parcel of land on which it is located.
      (3)   Setback requirements may be modified, as provided in §
154-13-003(C), when placement of a tower in a location which will reduce the
visual impact can be accomplished. For example, adjacent to trees which may
visually hide the tower.
   (C)   Method to measure tower height. Tower height shall be measured from
existing grade.
   (D)   Illumination. Towers shall not be artificially lighted except as

of a conditional use permit or building permit.
(Ord. 466, passed 2-22-96)
§ 154-13-003 TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES ON ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   Any telecommunication facilities which are not attached to a tower may be
permitted on any antenna support structure at least 20 feet tall, regardless of
the zoning restrictions applicable to the zoning district where the structure
is located. Telecommunications facilities attached to an antenna support
structure shall not extend more than 20 feet above the antenna support
structure. Telecommunication facilities are prohibited on all other structures.
(Ord. 466, passed 2-22-96)

foreseeable adverse impact(s) that might occur as a result of the requested
modification.
      (2)   A technical study that documents and supports the criteria
submitted by the applicant upon which the request for modification is based.
The technical study shall be certified by an engineer and shall document the
existence of the facts related to the proposed modifications and its
relationship to surrounding right-of-ways and properties.
      (3)   Identification of all parcels of land where the proposed tower
could be located, without such modifications as requested, attempts by the
applicant to contract and negotiate an agreement for collocation and the result

      (1)   Whether the tower, as modified, will be compatible with and not
unduly impact the character and integrity of surrounding properties within 300
feet adversely.
      (2)   Whether on-site and/or off-site conditions mitigate adverse
impacts.
      (3)   Whether alternatives exist that would not require the requested
modification(s).

WIRELESS FACILITIES IN RIGHTS-OF-WAY
§ 154-16.01 APPLICATION.
   (A)   Applications that are NOT subject to use permit requirements:
      (1)   Utility poles.
         (a)   A new, replacement or modified utility pole for SWF collocations
installed in the ROW is NOT subject to zoning review or approval if it does not
exceed the greater of either:
            1.   Ten feet above the tallest existing utility pole (excluding
utility poles supporting only wireless facilities), that is located within 500
feet of the proposed site for the new, replacement or modified pole if that
existing pole was in place prior to August 9, 2017, but the new pole cannot be
more than 50 feet above ground level; or
            2.   Forty feet above ground level. The existing utility pole that
is used as the basis for the new, replacement or modified utility pole must be
in the same ROW and jurisdictional boundary of the town. If there is no
existing verticality, the new, replacement or modified utility pole may not
exceed 40 feet above ground level.
         (b)   Applications are required to be approved unless the utility pole
does not comply with:
            1.   Applicable codes;
            2.   Code provisions or regulations that concern public safety;
            3.   Objective design standards; reasonable stealth and concealment
requirements;
            4.   Reasonable spacing requirements concerning the location of new
utility poles in the ROW.
      (2)   Small wireless facility (SWF) collocations of new small wireless
facilities.
         (a)   SWF collocations of new small wireless facilities are NOT
subject to zoning review and approval if they do not exceed ten feet above the
utility pole or wireless support structure (defined as including a monopole if
there was an existing one in the ROW) and do not exceed 50 feet above ground
level. Applications for a permit to collocate SWFs to utility poles in the ROW,
in any zoning district, are required to be approved unless the application does
not meet:
            1.   Applicable codes;
            2.   Code provisions or regulations that concern public safety;
            3.   Objective design standards for decorative utility poles;
            4.   Reasonable stealth and concealment requirements; or
            5.   Reasonable spacing requirements concerning the location of
ground-mounted equipment.
         (b)   Consolidated applications for the collocation of up to 25 SWFs
may be submitted by an applicant only if all SWFs included are substantially
the same type and involve substantially the same type of structure. SWF
collocations may be removed from the application and considered separately if
incomplete information was provided, the SWF does not qualify for consolidated
treatment or the SWF is subject to a denial. If the town denies an application
for not meeting one or more of the requirements listed above, documentation
must be submitted to the applicant on or before the date of denial that
includes the specific code provisions, regulations or requirements on which the
denial was based. The applicant may resubmit the application to cure the
deficiencies that the denial was based on within 30 days after denial. The town
must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30 days of receipt with
no additional fee charged to the applicant. The review of the resubmitted
application is limited to the deficiencies that were cited for the basis or
denial. If the town takes no action on the application within the specified
time frame, the application is deemed approved.
   (B)   Applications subject to zoning review.
      (1)   The modification of existing or the installation of new monopoles,
the installation or collocation of wireless facilities, and the installation of
utility poles and SWFs that exceed the heights that are exempt from zoning
review are subject to all of the zoning codes, regulations and regulatory
processes governing the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Applications for collocating to town utility poles are to be
processed in the same manner as applications to collocate to utility poles.
      (3)   An application must include an attestation that the small wireless
facilities will be collocated on the utility pole or wireless support structure
and that the small wireless facilities will be operational for use by a
wireless services provider to provide service within one year after the permit
issuance date.
      (4)   The town may deny an application only if there is a reasonable
basis for the denial and the denial is not discriminatory against the applicant
with respect to the placement of the facilities of other wireless providers. If
an application is denied, the town must notify the applicant in writing and
provide substantial supporting evidence for the reason for denial.
      (5)   The town requires the applicant to obtain necessary ROW permits to
collocate a small wireless facility in the ROW. An applicant seeking to
collocate multiple small wireless facilities within the town may file a
consolidated application for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facilities and substantially the same type of structure.
      (6)   An application shall be approved unless the application does not
meet the applicable codes, local code provisions or regulations that concern
public safety, objective design standards for decorative utility poles or
reasonable stealth and concealment requirements or public safety and reasonable
spacing requirements concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment in a
right-of-way. If it is determined that applicable codes or local code
provisions or regulations require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval may be
conditioned on such replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure.
   (7)   If an application is denied, the basis for the denial shall be
documented, including the specific code provisions, regulations or requirements
on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on
or before the date that the application is denied. The applicant may cure the
deficiencies identified by the town and resubmit the application within thirty
days after the denial without paying an additional application fee. The town
shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after receiving
the revised application. Any subsequent review is limited to the deficiencies
cited in the denial.

§ 155.07 LAND USE ASSUMPTIONS.
   The Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall be consistent with the town's
current land use assumptions for each service area and each category of
necessary public services as adopted by the town pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
   (A)   Reviewing the land use assumptions. Prior to the adoption or amendment
of an Infrastructure Improvements Plan, the town shall review and evaluate the
land use assumptions on which the Infrastructure Improvements Plan is to be
based to ensure that the land use assumptions within each service area conform
with the General Plan.
   (B)   Evaluating necessary changes. If the land use assumptions upon which
an Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based have not been updated within the
last five years, the town shall evaluate the land use assumptions to determine
whether changes are necessary. If, after general evaluation, the town
determines that the land use assumptions are still valid, the town shall issue
the report required in §
155.10.
   (C)   Required modifications to land use assumptions. If the town determines
that changes to the land use assumptions are necessary in order to adopt or

155.10.
(Res. 2774, passed 5-15-14; Am. Ord. 847, passed 5-15-14)
§ 155.08 INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Infrastructure Improvements Plan contents. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall be developed by qualified professionals and may be
based upon or incorporated within the town's Capital Improvements Plan. The
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall:
      (1)   Specify the categories of necessary public services for which the
town will impose a development impact fee, which may include any or all of the
following:
         (a)   Water;
         (b)   Wastewater;
         (c)   Stormwater, drainage, and flood control;
         (d)   Libraries;
         (e)   Street facilities;
         (f)   Fire protection;
         (g)   Police; and
         (h)   Parks.
      (2)   Define and provide a map of one or more service areas within which
the town will provide each category of necessary public services for which
development impact fees will be charged. Each service area must be defined in a
manner that demonstrates a substantial nexus between the capital facilities to
be provided in the service area and the EDUs to be served by those capital
facilities. For libraries and for parks larger than 30 acres, each service area
must be defined in a manner that demonstrates a direct benefit between the
capital facilities and the EDUs to be served by those capital facilities. The
town may cover more than one category of capital facilities in the same service
area provided that there is an independent substantial nexus or direct benefit,
as applicable, between each category of necessary public services and the EDUs
to be served.
      (3)   Identify and describe the land use assumptions upon which the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based in each service area.
      (4)   Analyze and identify the existing level of service provided by the
town to existing EDUs for each category of necessary public services in each
service area.
      (5)   Identify the level of service to be provided by the town for each
category of necessary public services in each service area based on the
relevant land use assumptions and any established town standards or policies
related to required levels of service. If the town provides the same category
of necessary public services in more than one service area, the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall include a comparison of the levels of service to be
provided in each service area.
      (6)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the existing capacity of the capital facilities in each service area,
the utilization of those capital facilities by existing EDUs, and the available
excess capacity of those capital facilities to serve new EDUs including any
existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage of such capacity.
The Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall additionally identify any changes or
upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned level of service to existing EDUs, or to meet new safety,
efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory requirements for services
provided to existing EDUs.
      (7)   Identify any grandfathered facilities and the impact thereof on the
need for necessary public services in each affected service area.
      (8)   Estimate the total number of existing and future EDUs within each
service area based on the town's land use assumptions and projected new EDUs in
each service area.
      (9)   Based on the analysis in divisions (3) through (6) above, provide a
summary table or tables describing the level of service for each category of
necessary public services by relating the required capital facilities to EDUs
in each service area, and identifying the applicable EDU factor associated with
each category of development.
      (10)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing
capital facilities and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be
required to provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service
area as a result of the new projected EDUs in that service area, for a period
not to exceed ten years. Nothing in this division shall prohibit the town from
additionally including in its Infrastructure Improvements Plan projected
utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer than ten
years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded from the
calculation of the plan-based cost per EDU.
      (11)   For each category of necessary public services, estimate the total
cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital facilities
that will be required to serve new EDUs, including costs of land acquisition,
improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to
design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs, as well as
projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include costs for
ongoing operation and maintenance of Capital Facilities, nor for replacement of
Capital Facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve
existing EDUs. If the Infrastructure Improvements Plan includes changes or
upgrades to existing Capital Facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned Level of Service to existing EDUs, or to meet new
regulatory requirements for services provided to existing EDUs, such costs
shall be identified and distinguished in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (12)   Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other
sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities
identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, which shall include
estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad
valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and
the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based
on the approved land use assumptions. The Infrastructure Improvements Plan
shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct and
implement the new or expanded capital facilities.
      (13)   Calculate required offsets as follows:
         (a)   From the forecasted revenues in division (12) above, identify
those sources of revenue that are attributable to new development and will
contribute to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services.
         (b)   For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to
division (13)(a) above, calculate the relative contribution of each category of
development to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services in
each service area.
         (c)   Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to
division (13)(b) above, for each category of necessary public services,
calculate the total offset to be provided to each category of development in
each service area.
         (d)   For each category of necessary public services, convert the
total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service
area into an offset amount per EDU by dividing the total offset for each
category of development by the number of EDUs associated with that category of
development.
         (e)   Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the
required offset, if the town imposes a construction, contracting, or similar
excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege
tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax
classifications in the town, the entire excess portion of the construction,
contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the
capital costs of necessary public services provided to new development unless
the excess portion is already utilized for such purpose pursuant to this
section.
         (f)   In determining the amount of required offset for land included
in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter
4, Article 6, the town shall take into account any capital facilities provided
by the district that are included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
the capital costs paid by the district for such capital facilities, and shall
offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district
proportionally.
      (14)   Calculate the plan-based cost per EDU by:
         (a)   Dividing the total projected costs to provide capital facilities
to new EDUs for each category of necessary public services in each service area
as determined pursuant to division (9) of this section into the number of new
EDUs projected for that service area over a period not to exceed ten years,
considering the specific EDU factor(s) associated with such EDUs for each
category of necessary public services.
         (b)   Subtracting the required offset per EDU calculated pursuant to
division (11) of this section.
   (B)   Multiple plans. An Infrastructure Improvements Plan adopted pursuant
to this section may address one or more of the town's categories of necessary
public services in any or all of the town's service areas. Each capital
facility shall be subject to no more than one Infrastructure Improvements Plan
at any given time.
   (C)   Reserved capacity. The town may reserve capacity in an Infrastructure
Improvements Plan to serve one or more planned future developments, including
capacity reserved through a development agreement pursuant to §
155.13. All reservations of existing capacity must be disclosed in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan at the time it is adopted.
(Res. 2774, passed 5-15-14; Am. Ord. 847, passed 5-15-14)

§ 155.11 COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Collection. Development impact fees, together with administrative
charges assessed pursuant to division (A)(7) of this section, shall be
calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence, expand,
or change development, specifically:
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement
adopted pursuant to §
155.13 or an agreement authorized pursuant to division (E) below, development
impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit according to
the current development impact fee schedule for the applicable service area(s)
as adopted, or according to any other development impact fee schedule.
      (2)   If a building permit is not required for the development, but a
water connection is required, any and all development impact fees due shall be
paid at the time the water service connection is purchased.
      (3)   If the development is located in a service area with a stormwater,
drainage, and flood control development impact fee, and neither a building
permit, water, or sewer service connection is required, the storm drainage
development impact fee due shall be paid at the time a civil or site permit is
issued for the development.
      (4)   No building permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of
occupancy shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed
in the previous paragraphs.
      (5)   If a building permit is for a change in the type of building use,
an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a
residential or non-residential point of demand to the water or wastewater
system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service
units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development
impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type.
      (6)   If there is a building occupancy permit or business license
application filed and it is determined that the proposed occupancy or business
includes an expanded or changed use resulting in additional service units, the
development impact fee may be assessed on the additional service unit resulting
from the expansion or change.
      (7)   For issued permits that expire or are voided, development impact
fees and administrative charges shall be as follows:
         (a)   If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or
voided permit, and the development impact fees paid for such development have
not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any
development impact fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the
fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed.
         (b)   If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being
sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit applicant
shall pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in
effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original
permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit
applicant, the new permit applicant shall pay development impact fees as if it
were the original permittee.
   (B)   Exceptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either of
the following conditions:
      (1)   Development impact fees have been paid for the development and the
permit(s) which triggered the collection of the development impact fees have
not expired or been voided.
      (2)   The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development impact
fees involve modification or replacement of existing residential or
nonresidential development that has paid the then applicable development impact
fee and that do not:
         (a)   Add new EDUs;
         (b)   Increase the impact of existing EDUs on existing or future
capital facilities; or
         (c)   Change the land-use type of the existing development to a
different category of development for which a higher development impact fee
would have been due. To the extent that any modification or replacement does
not meet the requirements of this paragraph, the development impact fee due
shall be the difference between the development impact fee that was or would
have been due on the existing development and the development impact fee that
is due on the development as modified.
   (C)   Temporary exemptions from development impact fee schedules. New
developments in the town shall be temporarily exempt from increases in
development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or modified
development impact fee schedules as follows:
      (1)   Residential uses. On or after the day that the first building
permit is issued for a single- family residential development, the town shall,
at the permittee's request, provide the permittee with an applicable
development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24
months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which
shall expire at the end of the first business day of the twenty-fifth month
thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development impact
fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same single-family residential
development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee
schedule.
      (2)   Commercial, industrial and multifamily uses. On or after the day
that the final approval, as defined in A.R.S. § 9-463.05(T)(4), is issued for a
commercial, industrial or multifamily development, the town shall provide an
applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period
of 24 months beginning on the day that final development approval of a site
plan or final subdivision plat is given, and which shall expire at the end of
the first business day of the twenty-fifth month thereafter. During the
effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule, any
building permit issued for the same development shall not be subject to any new
or modified development impact fee schedule.
      (3)   Other development. Any category of development not covered under
divisions (C)(1) or (C)(2) shall pay development impact fees according to the
fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as specified in division
(A) of this section.
      (4)   Changes to site plans and subdivision plats. Notwithstanding the
other requirements of this subsection, if changes are made to a development's
final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service
units after the issuance of a grandfathered development impact fee schedule,
the town may assess any new or modified development impact fees against the
additional service units. If the town reduces the amount of an applicable
development impact fee during the period that a grandfathered development
impact fee schedule is in force, the town shall assess the lower development
impact fee.
   (D)   Option to pursue special fee determination. Where a development is of
a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development
appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development
has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated
with providing necessary public services to that development will differ
substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified
category of development, the town may require the applicant to provide the
Assistant Town Manager with an alternative development impact fee analysis.
Based on a projection of the actual burdens and costs that will be associated
with the development, the alternative development impact fee analysis may
propose a unique fee for the development based on the application of an
appropriate EDU factor to the applicable plan-based cost per EDU, or may
propose that the development be covered under the development impact fee
schedule governing a different and more analogous category of development. The
Assistant Town Manager shall review the alternative impact fee analysis and
shall make a determination as to the development impact fee to be charged. Such
decision shall be appealable pursuant to §
155.14. The Assistant Town Manager may require the applicant to pay an
administrative fee to cover the actual costs of reviewing the special fee
determination application.
   (E)   Time payment agreements for commercial, industrial, and multifamily
projects.
      (1)   For commercial, industrial, and multifamily projects, the town may
enter into an agreement for the deferred collection of the development impact
fees subject to the following:
         (a)   Such agreements shall not exceed 60 months;
         (b)   Such agreements shall be approved by the Assistant Town Manager;
         (c)   Payments on the outstanding balance of such agreement shall be
made monthly or annually; and
         (d)   No interest shall accrue or be payable if the development impact
fees are paid in full within 60 months and in accordance with the terms of the
agreement.
      (2)   For commercial, industrial, and multifamily projects requiring five
or more EDUs, the town may enter into an agreement for the deferred collection
of development impact fees subject to the following:
         (a)   Such agreements shall not exceed 120 months;
         (b)   Such agreements shall be approved by the Town Council;
         (c)   Payments on the outstanding development impact fees shall be
made monthly or annually; and
         (d)   The interest rate, if any, that shall be charged on the
outstanding development impact fees shall be determined by the Town Council.
      (3)   For commercial, industrial, and multifamily projects requiring more
than ten EDUs, the town may enter into an agreement for the deferred collection
of the development impact fees subject to the following:
         (a)   Such agreements shall not exceed 120 months;
         (b)   Such agreements shall be approved by the Town Council;
         (c)   Payments on the outstanding development impact fees shall be
made monthly or annually. The agreement may allow for the deferral of the first
payment for up to 36 months; and
         (d)   The interest rate, if any, that shall be charged on the
outstanding development impact fees shall be determined by the Town Council.
      (4)   Any agreement for the deferral of development impact fees pursuant
to this section shall be in a form approved by the Town Attorney, shall comply
with state law, and shall be secured by any assurances deemed necessary by the
town.

§ 155.12 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE CREDITS AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Eligibility of capital facility. All development impact fee credits
must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   One of the following is true:
         (a)   The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward a
capital facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit
will be issued, must be identified in an adopted Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and fee report as a capital facility for which a development impact fee
was assessed; or
         (b)   The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town
that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility
should have been included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan in lieu of a
different capital facility that was included in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject
capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the
town shall amend the Infrastructure Improvements Plan to include the subject
replacement facility and delete the capital facility that will be replaced.
      (2)   Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a
developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by
the town through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the
developer will be paid or reimbursed by the town for any contribution, payment,
construction, or dedication from any town funding source including an agreement
to reimburse the developer with future collected development impact fees
pursuant to §
155.13, any credits claimed by the developer shall be:
         (a)   Deducted from any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the town;
or
         (b)   Reduced by the amount of such payment or reimbursement.
   (B)   Eligibility of subject development. To be eligible for a credit, the
subject development must be located within the service area of the eligible
capital facility.
   (C)   Calculation of credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the
costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted Infrastructure
Improvements Plan for which a development fee was assessed pursuant to the fee
report. If the gross impact fee for a particular category of necessary public
service is adopted at an amount lower than the plan-based cost per EDU, the
amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to the difference between
the plan-based cost per EDU and the gross impact fee adopted. A credit shall
not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in providing the eligible
capital facility.
   (D)   Allocation of credits. Before any credit can be issued to a subject
development (or portion thereof), the credit must be allocated to that
development as follows:
      (1)   The developer and the town must execute a credit agreement
including all of the following:
         (a)   The total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an
eligible capital facility.
         (b)   The estimated number of EDUs to be served within the subject
development.
         (c)   The method by which the credit values will be distributed within
the subject development.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of
development impact fee credits through an application for a credit agreement
(which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to §
155.13).
      (3)   If a building permit is issued or a water/sewer connection is
purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a credit
agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated
retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any
remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this chapter.
      (4)   If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or
relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior
to execution of a credit agreement or development agreement, credits resulting
from the eligible capital facility will only be allocated to the development if
the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successors)
in interest for the subject development.
      (5)   If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible capital facility,
such entities must enter into a single credit agreement with the town, and any
request for the allocation of credit within the subject development(s) must be
made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible capital facility.
      (6)   Credits may only be reallocated from or within a subject
development with the town's approval of an amendment to an executed credit
agreement, subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town,
or its legal successor in interest and the entity that currently controls the
subject development are parties to the request for reallocation.
         (b)   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
credits already issued for the subject development.
      (7)   A credit agreement may authorize the allocation of credits to a
noncontiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town or
its legal successor in interest, the entity that currently controls the subject
development, and the entity that controls the noncontiguous parcel are parties
to the request for reallocation.
         (b)   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
credits already issued for the subject development.
         (c)   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that
served by the eligible capital facility.
         (d)   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service
from the eligible capital facility.
         (e)   The credit agreement specifically states the value of the
credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a mechanism
for future determination of the credit values.
         (f)   The credit agreement does not involve the transfer of credits to
or from any property subject to a development agreement.
   (E)   Credit agreement. Credits shall be issued only pursuant to a credit
agreement executed in accordance with division (D) of this section. The
Assistant Town Manager is authorized to enter into a credit agreement with the
controlling entity of a subject development, subject to the following:
      (1)   The developer requesting the credit agreement shall provide all
information requested by the town to allow it to determine the value of the
credit to be applied.
      (2)   An application for a credit agreement shall be submitted to the
town by the developer within one year of the date on which ownership or control
of the capital facility passes to the town.
      (3)   The developer shall submit a draft credit agreement to the
Assistant Town Manager for review in the form provided to the applicant by the
town. The draft credit agreement shall include, at a minimum, all of the
following information and supporting documentation:
         (a)   A legal description and map depicting the location of the
subject development for which credit is being applied. The map shall depict the
location of the capital facilities that have been or will be provided.
         (b)   An estimate of the total EDUs that will be developed within the
subject development depicted on the map and described in the legal description.
         (c)   A list of the capital facilities, associated physical
attributes, and the related costs as stated in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan.
         (d)   Documentation showing the date(s) of acceptance by the town, if
the capital facilities have already been provided.
         (e)   The total amount of credit to be applied within the subject
development and the calculations leading to the total amount of credit.
         (f)   The credit amount to be applied to each EDU within the subject
development for each category of necessary public services.
      (4)   The town's determination of the credit to be allocated is final.
      (5)   Upon execution of the credit agreement by the town and the
applicant, credits shall be deemed allocated to the subject development.
      (6)   Any amendment to a previously approved credit agreement must be
initiated within two years of the town's final acceptance of the eligible
capital facility for which the amendment is requested.
      (7)   Any credit agreement approved as part of a development agreement
shall be amended in accordance with the terms of the development agreement and
§
155.13.
   (F)   Issuance of credits. Credits allocated pursuant to division (D) of
this section may be issued and applied toward the gross impact fees due from a
development, subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Credits issued for an eligible capital facility may only be applied
to the development impact fee due for the applicable category of necessary
public services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another category of
necessary public services.
      (2)   Credits shall only be issued when the eligible capital facility
from which the credits were derived has been accepted by the town or when
adequate security for the completion of the eligible capital facility has been
provided in accordance with all terms of an executed development agreement.
      (3)   Where credits have been issued pursuant to division (F)(2) above,
an impact fee due at the time a building permit is issued shall be reduced by
the credit amount stated in or calculated from the executed credit agreement.
Where credits have not yet been issued, the gross impact fee shall be paid in
full, and a refund of the credit amount shall be due when the developer
demonstrates compliance with division (F)(2) above in a written request to the
town.
      (4)   Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to
another permit or parcel, except that credits may be released for reuse on the
same subject development if a building permit for which the credits were issued
has expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a refund under §
155.15(A)(2)(a).
(Res. 2774, passed 5-15-14; Am. Ord. 847, passed 5-15-14)
§ 155.13 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   Development agreements containing provisions regarding development impact
fees, development impact fee credits, and/or disbursement of revenues from
development impact fee accounts shall comply with the following:
   (A)   Development agreement required. A development agreement is required to
authorize any of the following:
      (1)   To issue credits prior to the town's acceptance of an eligible
capital facility.
      (2)   To allocate credits to a parcel that is not contiguous with the
subject development and that does not meet the requirements of §
155.12(D)(7).
      (3)   To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using
funds from development impact fee accounts.
      (4)   To allocate different credit amounts per EDU to different parcels
within a subject development.
      (5)   For a single family residential dwelling unit, to allow development
impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit
as provided in this section.
   (B)   General requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared and
executed in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and any applicable requirements
of the town code. Except where specifically modified by this section, all
provisions of §
155.12 shall apply to any credit agreement that is authorized as part of a
development agreement.
   (C)   Early credit issuance. A development agreement may authorize the
issuance of credits prior to acceptance of an eligible capital facility by the
town when the development agreement specifically states the form and value of
the security (i.e. bond, letter of credit, and the like) to be provided to the
town prior to issuance of any credits. The town shall determine the acceptable
form and value of the security to be provided.
   (D)   Non-contiguous credit allocation. A development agreement may
authorize the allocation of credits to a non-contiguous parcel only if all of
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that
served by the eligible capital facility.
      (2)   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from
the eligible capital facility.
      (3)   The development agreement specifically states the value of the
credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a mechanism
for future determination of the credit values.
   (E)   Uneven credit allocation. The development agreement must specify how
credits will be allocated among different parcels on a per-EDU basis, if the
credits are not to be allocated evenly. If the development agreement is silent
on this topic, all credits will be allocated evenly among all parcels on a per-
EDU basis.
   (F)   Use of reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from impact fee
accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be utilized in
accordance with applicable law for the use of town funds in construction or
acquisition of capital facilities, including A.R.S. §§ 34-201 et seq.
   (G)   Deferral of fees. A development agreement may provide for the deferral
of payment of development impact fees for a residential development beyond the
issuance of a building permit, provided that a development impact fee may not
be paid later than the 15 days after the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy for that dwelling unit. The development agreement shall provide for
the value of any deferred development impact fees to be supported by
appropriate security, including a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash bond.
   (H)   Waiver of fees. If the town agrees to waive any development impact
fees assessed on development in a development agreement, the town shall
reimburse the appropriate development impact fee account for the amount that
was waived.
   (I)   No obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the town to enter
into any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit agreement
permitted by this section.

§ 155.15 REFUNDS OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current
owner of property within the town who submits a written request to the town and
demonstrates that:
      (1)   The permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development
impact fee have expired or been voided prior to the commencement of the
development for which the permits were issued and the development impact fees
collected have not been expended, encumbered, or pledged for the repayment of
financing or debt; or
      (2)   The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in
interest paid a development impact fee for the applicable capital facility on
or after August 1, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists:
         (a)   The capital facility designed to serve the subject real property
has been constructed, has the capacity to serve the subject real property and
any development for which there is reserved capacity, and the service which was
to be provided by that capital facility has not been provided to the subject
real property from that capital facility or from any other infrastructure.
         (b)   After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility, the
town fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time
period identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, as it may be
amended, and the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject
real property from that capital facility or any other infrastructure.
         (c)   For a category of necessary public services other than water or
wastewater facilities, any part of a development impact fee is not spent within
ten years of the town's receipt of the development impact fee.
         (d)   Any part of a development impact fee for water or wastewater
facilities is not spent within 15 years of the town's receipt of the
development impact fee.
         (e)   The development impact fee was calculated and collected for the
construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital facility
serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the
capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan by a factor of 10% or more. In such event, the
current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request as set forth in
this division (A), be entitled to a refund for the difference between the
amounts of the development impact fee charged for and attributable to such
construction cost and the amount the development impact fee would have been
calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the fee
report. The refund contemplated by this subsection shall relate only to the
costs specific to the construction of the applicable capital facility and shall
not include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly
incurred for construction of the capital facility that are included in the
development impact fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
   (B)   Earned interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include

sought to be dedicated, but have not been accepted by the town, shall make
application therefor to the Town Engineer ("Application for Abandonment").

§ 156.03 RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND EASEMENTS NOT SUBJECT TO ABANDONMENTS.
   Any rights-of-way or easement that has not been dedicated to and accepted by
the public and accepted by the town shall not be abandoned by the town. Rights-
of-way or easements dedicated to the town shall be treated in the same manner
as rights-of-way or easements that have been dedicated to and accepted by the

the Town Engineer shall submit a Council Decision Request ("CDR") to the Town
Council for action. The Town Council may take action on the CDR. The Town
Council may, but shall not be required to, hold a public hearing before taking
action. If the abandonment, or any portion thereof, on the CDR is approved by
the Town Council, a resolution shall be submitted for the next regular Council
meeting to finalize the abandonment. The Town Council shall not abandon any
right-of-way or easement if the effect of such abandonment is to leave any land
adjoining the same without a legal connection between the land served by the
right-of-way or easement and another established public roadway, unless there
is expressly reserved in the conveying instrument the roadway rights for
ingress and egress for public or emergency vehicles, all property owners,
property owner guests and invitees, and persons lawfully conducting business on
the land.
