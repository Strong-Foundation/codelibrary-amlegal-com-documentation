otherwise provided in this code, shall be responsible for a civil code
infraction, and upon such finding of responsibility therefor may be punished by
a civil sanction not to exceed $500. Each day that a violation continues shall
be a separate offense punishable as herein provided.
      (1)   In addition to any monetary civil sanction, the Civil Hearing
Officer shall order the defendant to abate the civil code infraction, unless it

recordable as a lien upon such land and shall run with the land. The town, at
its sole option, may record a notice of civil sanction and abatement order with

combination of such fine, imprisonment, and probation.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, any person found to
have violated any provision of this code or amendments thereto, which pursuant
to this section is classified as a civil code infraction, and who has been
twice previously found to have violated such provision within the preceding 24
months, shall, in addition to any penalty prescribed for such civil code
infraction, be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine
not to exceed $2,500, by imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, by

may order the defendant incarcerated until the payment, or a specified part
thereof, is paid, or revoke the defendant's probation or parole and sentence

balance as are authorized for the collection of an unpaid civil judgment
entered against the defendant in an action on a debt. Any levy or execution for
collection does not discharge a defendant incarcerated for non-payment until
the amount of the fine, restitution, jail services recovery fee, or other fee
or cost is fully collected.
   (D)   If a fine, restitution, jail services recovery fee, or other fee or
cost is imposed on an enterprise, it is the duty of the person or persons

of such a plan in no way relieves the user for liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Also, nothing in
this section shall limit the authority of the town to take action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The town may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user or customer to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the orders issued pursuant to this chapter and shall be judicially
enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The town may order a user or customer which has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the town and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken.
      (2)   Notice may be served on the user or customer specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such an action, and a request that the user or customer show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting may
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 14 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
a representative of the user who meets the criteria of an authorized signatory.
      (3)   A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for
taking any other action against the user or customer.
   (D)   Compliance orders.
      (1)   When the town finds that a user or customer has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the town may issue an order to the user or customer responsible
for the discharge, directing that the user or customer come into compliance
within a specified time.
      (2)   If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
      (3)   Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address
the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer.
      (4)   A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a national pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user or customer of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation.
      (5)   Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against or
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user or customer.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the town finds that a user or customer has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's or customer's past violations are likely to
recur, the town may issue an order to the user or customer directing it to
cease and desist all such violations and directing the user or customer to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or
a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user or customer.
   (F)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the town finds that the user or customer has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the town may fine such user or customer in an amount not to
exceed $2,500. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis.
The town may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions,
such as notices and orders, to the fine.
      (2)   Unpaid fines shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an
additional penalty of 5% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue
thereafter at a rate of 10% per annum. A lien against the user's or customer's
property (including but not limited to a judgement lien) may be sought for
unpaid fines.
      (3)   Users or customers desiring to dispute such fines must file a
written request for the town to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Upon receipt of
such request, the Town Manager (or his/her designee) shall convene a hearing on
the matter within 30 days of receiving the request. In the event the user's or
customer's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user and customer.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user or customer.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The town may immediately suspend a user's or customer's discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to be present
or cause imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons.
      (2)   The town may also immediately suspend a user's or customer's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the wastewater system, or to which presents or may
present an endangerment to the environment.
      (3)   Any user or customer notified of a suspension of its discharge
shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
or customer's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the town shall take such steps as deemed necessary (including immediate
severance of the sewer connection) to prevent or minimize damage to the
wastewater system or its receiving stream, or any endangerment to any
individuals. The town shall allow the user or customer to recommence its
discharge when the user or customer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
town that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in division (H) of this section are initiated against the user or
customer.
      (4)   A user or customer that is responsible, in whole or in part, for
any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement to the town within five calendar days, describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence.
      (5)   Nothing in division (C) of this section shall be interpreted as
requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge. Any user or customer that violates the
requirements of this chapter is subject to discharge termination. Such user or
customer shall be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) of this section why the
proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the town shall
not be a bar to or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user
or customer.
   (I)   Pumping and emergency remediation. Any user or customer that causes
discharge that endangers the environment or the welfare of persons shall be
responsible to reimburse the town for pumping, labor charges, and other
emergency remediation or prevention actions.
(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)

responsibilities.
      (2)   The town shall have the right to set up on the user's or customer's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's or customer's operation.
      (3)   The town may require the user or customer to install monitoring
equipment. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user or customer
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated at least annually by a certified technician to ensure their
accuracy. Calibration records shall be made available to the town upon request.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user or customer at the written or verbal request of the town. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the user or customer.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the town access to the user's or
customer's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

51.040 et seq.
§ 51.151 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the town has been refused access to a building, structure, or property or
any part thereof and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the town
designed to verify compliance with this chapter, or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the town may seek issuance of a search warrant.
(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)
§ 51.152 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user or customer obtained from reports, surveys,
industrial wastewater discharge permit applications, industrial wastewater
permits, and monitoring programs, and from the town's inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction unless the
user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the town that the release of such information would be a misuse of public
records because it would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law.
Any such request must be asserted by the user at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that some or all the information therein should be held confidential,
those portions of the report shall not be made available for public inspection
but the town shall, instead, take reasonable steps in accordance with state law
to obtain an order closing those portions of the record to the inspection.
However, nothing herein shall preclude the town from making such records
available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES
program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Note that wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.

in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria: 1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except for pH;
      (3)   Any other discharge violation that the town believes has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of town personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the town's exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet within 90 days of the scheduled date a compliance
schedule milestone contained in the industrial wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date any required

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
§ 51.170 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user or customer. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused
by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user or customer that wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user or customer can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user or customer has submitted the following information to the
town as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including the exact date and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user or customer seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users and customers will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users and customers shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards
upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility, until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)
§ 51.171 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user or customer shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions of this
chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either: a local limit exists for
each pollutant discharged and the user or customer was in compliance with each
limit prior to and during the pass through or interference; or no local limit
exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents
from the user's or customer's prior discharges when the town was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)
§ 51.172 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's or customer's treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user or customer may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
      (1)   If a user or customer knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the town at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user or customer shall submit oral notice to the town of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards as soon as
possible, but no later than 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including the exact date and times; if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The town may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   Bypasses are prohibited, and the town may take an enforcement action
against a user or customer for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)   The user or customer submitted notices as required under division
(B) of this section.
   (D)   The town may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the town determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in division (C) of this section.

§ 52.107 POLICY OF TOWN FOR EXTENSIONS.
   The water main extension policy of the town for town water mains and the
policy to be followed in connection therewith shall be, and the same is hereby
declared to be as follows:
   (A)   Developers must pay all costs for constructing mains of such sizes as
to afford adequate service during peak demands.
   (B)   The minimum water requirements will be per applicable state and
federal regulations.
   (C)   The Utilities Manager or his/her designee will review and approve the
required size and layout of public water mains that will meet both domestic
water needs and fire flow requirements as specified in the Water and Wastewater
Technical Design Guidelines.
   (D)   The Utility Department will not perform field engineering nor submit
detailed plans and specifications for any developer. This work is to be
performed by a civil engineer registered in the state and employed by the
developer. Before construction begins, final detailed plans and specifications
for the water main extensions in the development must be approved by the
Utility Department. The cost of staking the location of the new water mains and
the cost of inspecting the construction shall be assumed by the developer. The
town will perform the inspection during construction.
   (E)   Where booster pumps are necessary to maintain adequate pressures in
the mains due to the development being near or above the hydraulic gradient of
the distribution system of the town service area, the developer shall
construct, at his own expense, the necessary booster pumping station and
storage facilities to town specifications as addressed in the town's Water and
Wastewater Technical Design Guidelines. The town will assume ownership,
maintenance and operation of such booster pump installation upon its completion
and acceptance by the town.
   (F)   All extensions must comply with the town's Water Master Plan.
(Ord. O2011-03, passed 2-7-11)
§ 52.108 EXTENSIONS IN SUBDIVISIONS, SINGLE LOT, AND SUBLOT DEVELOPMENTS AND

agent shall furnish and install in accordance with plans approved by the
Utilities Manager all water mains, service connections, valves, fittings and
appurtenances within the boundary of the development as well as the streets
bounding the entire development. Review fees shall be paid as established by
Town Council resolution. In addition, the owner or its agent shall furnish and
install all off-site water mains as necessary to complete a looped connection,
if feasible, to existing town mains as determined by the Utilities Manager. All
water lines are to be constructed to conform to the town’s Water Master Plan,
and are to be constructed as a general area improvement whether they do, or do
not, directly service the property being developed. For developments
principally residential in character, water infrastructure development shall
follow the town’s Water and Wastewater Technical Design Guidelines.
   (B)   For all developments, fire hydrants, valves, pipe, and fittings
required for the hydrant installation shall also be installed by the owner or
its agent in accordance with plans approved by the Utilities Manager. Review
fees shall be paid as set forth in §

public water mains shall be approximately 500 feet in single-family residential
developments. Refer to the Utilities Technical Design Guidelines for additional
fire hydrant requirements.
   (C)   Existing lines larger than eight inches in diameter are considered
part of the transmission system, and are not part of the water distribution
system. An owner or its agent may be required to construct distribution mains
of the required size in parallel to such existing transmission system mains.
Where existing distribution system mains within a development, or the streets
bounding a development, are smaller in size, or are otherwise inadequate, the
owner or its agent may be required to replace or parallel such mains with those
of the required size.

of the parcel, or multi-parcel property under single ownership. An easement
along the entire property frontage may be required by the town to allow for
future extension of new water mains.
   (E)   The service connections installed by an owner or its agent shall be
guaranteed against any and all defects by the owner or its agent for a period
of two years after acceptance of the installations by the Utility Manager.
   (F)   After acceptance by the town of the water mains and service
connections, the owner or its agent may make application to the Utility
Department for the installation of one or more meters to be installed on the
new service connections to measure construction water used. The owner or its
agent will be held responsible for all water used from the date the meter is

one inch or smaller water meter connection that is not located within a
subdivision subject to §
52.405(C), if the projected water use is less than one-half acre-foot per year
the town will provide a water service connection pursuant to this division, but
only if the requirements of §
52.108 are satisfied and if the town determines in its sole discretion that
such water is available in the town water supply. Non-residential parcels may
be authorized to have two meters, one for interior use and one for exterior
landscaping at the town's sole discretion, but only if the projected water use
through both meters is less than one-half acre-foot per year.
   (E)   Multifamily. Notwithstanding §
52.204(D), for a parcel that is not in a subdivision subject to §
52.405(C) that includes more than one dwelling unit, if each dwelling unit has
a separate water service meter and separate service line, and if the projected
water use for each separately-metered dwelling unit is equal to or less than
one-third acre-foot per year, the town will provide water service connections
to each dwelling unit through a separate one inch or smaller meter if the
requirements of §
52.108 are satisfied and if the town determines in its sole discretion that

water supplies and must be dedicated and delivered to the town. The applicant
must construct all water treatment and delivery infrastructure capacity
identified in a Water Master Plan prepared by the applicant and approved by the
town. The Town Council may waive the requirements of this division for
commercial or industrial uses within the town if the Town Council determines
that a commitment of a portion of the town water supply to the proposed
commercial or industrial use will (i) not unfairly and adversely impact
existing town water customers and (ii) provide town residents with benefits
that significantly outweigh the costs of allocating town water supplies for the
proposed commercial or industrial use.
   (G)   The town at its sole discretion may authorize a meter size greater
that one inch and not require the applicant to provide the town new water
solely to provide emergency fire flow.

   Charges for water utility service shall be made at monthly intervals and
shall, to the extent possible, be consistent with the policy for charging for
water in direct proportion to the cost of securing, developing, conserving and
delivering water to the customers of the town water system in the particular
service area. Water charges will be computed through the summation of the
monthly minimum, the monthly water use charge, and any special assessments,
taxes or surcharges that are or may be imposed by any governmental agency.
Water fees and water shortage surcharges are adopted by the Town Council by
resolution, and current fees and water shortage surcharges are on file in the
office of the Town Clerk and in the Town Utility Department.
   (A)   Fire protection service in the Cave Creek service area. The town will
supply only such water at such pressures as may be available from time to time
as a result of normal operations of its water system. The town does not
guarantee a specific water pressure or gallons-per-minute flow rate at any of
the fire hydrants installed. In the event service is interrupted or irregular
or defective or fails, the town will not be liable for any injuries or damages
arising therefrom. The customer shall make no claim against the town for any
loss or damage resulting from fire protection services provided. The town shall
furnish, install, own and maintain all public fire hydrants, subject to any
advance-in-aid-of-construction agreement or maintenance agreement that may be
required by the town. Water shall not be used from fire hydrants for any
purpose other than fire protection unless prior written consent is obtained
from the town, and charges will be made therefor at the estimated quantity
rates under the town’s general service rate.
   (B)   Standpipe charges. This service is available only at designated
locations for the use of hauling water when and if authorized by the town. The
town will supply water on a when-available basis, as determined by the town.
Water will be supplied only during normal working hours except where a coin or
card operated standpipe is available.
   (C)   Service minimum for non-use. All metered services, open or closed or
active or inactive and regardless of water usage, shall be charged the base
rate fee to the corresponding service size.

the Town as authorized pursuant to §§
52.501 and
52.999. The amount of surcharges will be recommended at the Town Council by the

determines the water shortage percentage pursuant to §
52.501. After Town Council approval of the recommended surcharges, water
customers shall be charged at monthly intervals pursuant to this section. In

the areas the town provides water and/or wastewater services, that for purposes
hereof, may be divided into service areas by the town.
      (2)   Municipal planning areas. Capacity charges imposed by the town may,
if necessary and appropriate, be collected by other state and local governments
on new development within the municipal planning areas and/or service areas,
and are outside of the Cave Creek town limits, pursuant to an intergovernmental
agreement that provides that the capacity charges collected be transferred to

development as herein defined in the capacity fee ordinances.
   (D)   Type of development not affected. This chapter will not apply to:
      (1)   Previously-issued building permits within the town limits. No
capacity charges will be assessed on a previously issued building permit which
has paid a prior assessed water/wastewater development fee or capacity fee.
Previously issued building permits which have not paid a water/ wastewater and/

agencies thereof, and (if mutually agreed by the parties) pursuant to payment
terms established in an intergovernmental agreement with the town.
   (E)   Effect of payment of capacity charges on other applicable town land
use, zoning, platting, subdivision or development regulations.
      (1)   The payment of capacity charges will not entitle the applicant to a
building permit unless all other applicable land use, zoning, planning,
platting, subdivision or other related requirements, standards and conditions
have been met. Such other requirements, standards and conditions are
independent of the requirement for payment of a capacity charge.
      (2)   This chapter will not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of

consideration any water and/or wastewater facilities provided by the special
district and capital costs paid by the special district for necessary water
and/or wastewater facilities and will not assess a portion of the capacity
charges otherwise calculated to be due that would duplicate the infrastructure
provided by the district or the costs imposed by the district on new
development.
(Ord. O2017-05, passed 5-1-17)
§ 53.05 PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION, CALCULATION AND COLLECTION.
   (A)   In general. An applicant will be notified by the town of the
applicable capacity charges required at the time of application for a building
permit or connection is requested. Capacity charges will be assessed by the
town at the time of application for a building permit or connect is requested
and will be paid by the applicant prior to the issuance of the building permit
or water and/or wastewater services are provided.
   (B)   Calculation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a water service agreement, the
town will determine the fees based on the requested meters size(s) and the
number of meter(s) requested.
      (2)   (a)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the
town will determine if it is for a change in use. In such cases, the capacity
charges due will be based only on the incremental difference in meter size.
         (b)   If the meter size increases from the existing meter to the new
requested meter, the client will be assessed the difference in capacity
charges.
         (c)   If the meter size decreases from the existing meter to the new
requested meter, the town will not refund the difference in fees assessed.
      (3)   (a)   After making these determinations (meter size and number of
meters), the town will assess the new development for water and/or wastewater
facilities a capacity charge incorporating any applicable offset if set forth
in the particular capacity charge calculation methodology. The final decision
of the Town Engineer may be appealed pursuant to §
53.07 herein.
         (b)   An applicant may request a non-binding estimate of capacity
charges due for a particular new development at any time by filing a request on
a form provided for such purpose by the Engineering Department; provided,
however, that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal application
for a building permit for new development is made. Such non-binding estimate is
solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant and shall in no way bind
the town nor preclude it from making amendments or revisions to any provisions
of this chapter, the specific capacity charge implementing ordinances or the
capacity fee schedules.
      (4)   The calculation of capacity charges due from a multiple-use new
development shall be based upon the aggregated size and number of water meters
requested in the new development.
      (5)   The calculation of capacity charges due from a phased new
development will be based upon the size and number of water meters requested
within the phase of development for which a separate building permit is
requested.
      (6)   Capacity charges will be calculated based on the capacity charge
amount in effect at the time of application for a building permit or connection
request is made.
   (C)   Offsets.
      (1)   Offsets against the amount of capacity charges due from a new
development will be provided for, among other things, contributions made or to
be made in the future in cash, or by dedication of land or by actual
construction of all or part of a water or wastewater facility by the affected
property owner for public facilities meeting or exceeding the demand generated
by the new development and the contribution is determined by the town to be a
reasonable substitute for the cost of water or wastewater facilities which are
included in the particular capacity charge calculation methodology.
      (2)   The amount of the excess contribution will be determined by the
town upon receipt of an application form requesting an offset; provided,
however, that:
         (a)   The town will make no reimbursement for excess contributions
unless it is part of a negotiated development agreement accepted by a vote of
the Mayor and Town Council.
         (b)   The excess contribution may not be transferred or credited to
any other type of charges or fees calculated to be due from that development
for other type of public facilities.
      (3)   No offset will be allowed unless the town has approved the
contribution or expenditure before it is made.
      (4)   Offsets for dedication of land or provision of water or wastewater
facilities will be applicable only as to capacity charges imposed for the same
types of facilities that are proposed to be dedicated or provided. Even if the
value of the dedication of land or provision of a facility exceeds the capacity
charges due for the type of water or wastewater facility, the excess value may
not be transferred to capacity charges calculated to be due from the applicant
for other types of public facilities that capacity charges or development fees
maybe imposed. Offsets may, however, be transferred to the same applicant or to
other applicants for new development, which are proposed within the final
approved platted area of the same development and for the same type of public
facility.
   (D)   Collection. The town will collect all applicable capacity charges at
the time of issuance of a water service agreement or meter set application and
will issue a receipt to the applicant for such payment unless:
      (1)   The applicant is determined to be entitled to a full offset; or
      (2)   The applicant has filed an appeal and a bond or other surety in the
amount of the capacity charges, as calculated by the town and approved by the
Town Attorney and Town Engineer, has been posted with the town.

a form provided by the town for such purposes.
         (b)   Abandonment of development after initiation of construction. An
applicant who has paid a capacity charge for a new development that a building

will constitute a waiver of entitlement to a refund. No interest shall be paid
by the town in calculating the amount of the refunds.
      (5)   The town may, at its option, make refunds of capacity charges by
direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other fees due for new

      (2)   Graffiti. 
         (a)   Removal required. The town shall provide, without charge,

private premises upon which graffiti has been placed. If the person fails to
remove or obliterate graffiti within 48 hours after the town has provided the
materials and has given the person written notice to remove or obliterate the
graffiti, the town may compel the removal or obliteration of graffiti by the
procedures set forth for the removal of litter outlined below.
         (b)   Method of removal or obliteration. For the purposes of this
division (2), TO REMOVE OR OBLITERATE GRAFFITI means to make the graffiti

         (c)   Appeals. The owner or person controlling such premises may,
prior to the date of compliance, appeal in writing to the Town Council from the
notice to remove or obliterate the graffiti. The Town Council shall, at its
next regular meeting after receiving the appeal, hear and determine the same
and the decision of the Town Council shall be final. The Town Council may
either affirm or reverse the notice to remove or obliterate the graffiti; or
may modify the scope of work as required in the notice.
   (B)   Notice to remove. To compel the removal of litter through the
provisions of this chapter, if a person owning or controlling any property
fails, neglects, or refuses to remove or properly dispose of litter located on
property owned or controlled by such person, he or she shall be given written
notice by the Clerk to remove all litter or cut such weeds from such property
within 30 days from the date the notice was received by him or her, and prior
to the date of compliance on the notice. Such notice shall be received not less
than 30 days before the date set thereon for compliance, and shall contain the
following: an estimate of the cost of removal by the town; a statement that
unless the person owning or controlling such property complies therewith within
30 days from the date such written notice is received the town will, at the
expense of the person owning or controlling said property, perform the
necessary work at a cost not to exceed the estimate given in the notice; and a
statement that such person may appeal in writing to the Town Council within 30
days from the date the notice is received by him or her and prior to the date
of compliance.
(`87 Code, § 10-2-5)
   (C)   Service of notice. Notice shall be personally served on the owner or
person controlling such property by the Town Manager or any other town officer
in the manner provided in A.R.C.P. 4(d), or mailed to the owner or person
controlling such property at his or her last known address by certified or
registered mail, or the address to which the tax bill for the property was last
mailed. If the owner does not reside on such property, a duplicate notice shall
also be sent to him or her by certified or registered mail at his or her last
known address.
(`87 Code, § 10-2-6)
   (D)   Appeal to Town Council. Prior to the date set for compliance on the
notice, the owner or person controlling such property may appeal in writing to
the Town Council from the demand of the Clerk. The Town Council shall, at its
next regular meeting after receiving the appeal, hear and determine the same
and the decision of the Town Council shall be final. The Town Council may
either affirm or reverse the decision of the Clerk or modify the scope of the
work as required in the notice.
(`87 Code, § 10-2-7)
   (E)   Removal by town. When any such person to whom notice, as aforesaid,
has been given, and on or before the date of compliance on the notice, or
within such further time as may have been granted by the Town Council on
appeal, fails, neglects, or refuses to move from such property any or all
litter and weeds, the Clerk is authorized and directed to cause same to be
removed and disposed of at the expense of the owner or person controlling such
property. Upon completion of the work, the Clerk shall prepare a verified
statement of account of the actual cost of such removal or abatement, the date
the work was completed, and the street address and the legal description of the
property on which said work was done, including 5% for additional inspection
and other incidental costs in connection therewith, and shall serve a duplicate
copy of such verified statement upon the person owning or controlling such
property in the manner prescribed in division (C) above. The owner or person
controlling such property shall have 30 days from the date of service upon him
or her to appeal in writing to the Town Council from the amount of the
assessment as contained in the verified statement. If an appeal is not filed
with the Clerk within such 30-day period, then the amount of the assessment as
determined by the Clerk shall become final and binding. If an appeal is taken,
the Town Council shall, at its next regular meeting, hear and determine the
appeal and may affirm the amount of the assessment, modify the amount thereof,
or determine that no assessment at all shall be made. The decision of the Town
Council shall be final and binding on all persons.
(`87 Code, § 10-2-8)
   (F)   Lien for removal. If no appeal is taken from the amount of the
assessment, or if an appeal is taken and the Town Council has affirmed or
modified the amount of the assessment, the original assessment or the
assessment as so modified shall be recorded in the office of the County
Recorder and, from the date of its recording, shall be a lien on said lot or
tract of land until paid. Such liens shall be subject and inferior to the lien
for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances of
record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under the provisions
of this section shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure or order of sale.
The town shall have the right to bring an action to enforce the lien in the
superior court at any time after the recording of the assessment, but failure
to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its validity. The recorded
assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited
therein and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the recording
thereof. A prior assessment for the purposes provided in this section shall not
be a bar to a subsequent assessment or assessments for such purposes, and any
number of liens on the same lot or tract of land may be enforced in the same
action.

permit from the town. Spark generating activities to include but not limited
to:
            1.   Welding
            2.   Grinding
            3.   Cutting steel, asphalt, or block
         (d)   All current building permits must call for and pass an
inspection of the area prior to undertaking any spark generating activities
outside of an enclosed structure. Spark generating activities include but are
not limited to:
            1.   Welding
            2.   Grinding
            3.   Cutting steel, asphalt, or block
         (e)   All spark generating activities shall be prohibited during days
declared to have a red flag warning for the area as issued by the National
Weather Service whether or not occurring before May 1 of each year.
         (f)   The use of ignition driven model rockets is prohibited.
         (g)   The use of fireworks and other pyrotechnic displays is
prohibited.
         (h)   The use of flame in any outside area such as flame based weed
removal is prohibited.
         (i)   Cooking, warming or campfires in all areas must have the
responsible party within sight of the flame and must always be attended to
until the flame has been extinguished and the coals are cold to the touch.
         (j)   Use of power-driven metal-bladed landscaping devices is
prohibited.
      (2)   Stage II restrictions shall include the following restrictions in
addition to those found in Stage I and shall be implemented any time the fire
danger level of the town is set to extreme:
         (a)   No smoking outside of vehicles, outside of residential yards or
outside of designated smoking areas.
         (b)   Wood burning for cooking, warming or campfires or the use of
charcoal in all areas is prohibited
         (c)   The use of tiki torches or other devices that emit a flame is
prohibited.
   (C)   If a conflict is found to exist between the requirements of a Stage II
and a Stage I restriction the Stage II restriction shall prevail.
   (D)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   COMBUSTIBLE GROUND COVER. Ground cover that is able to catch fire
easily.
      (2)   DESIGNATED SMOKING AREA. A defined area in public spaces or
commercial businesses that have been designated as an area where smoking is
allowed.
      (3)   EXTREME FIRE DANGER LEVEL. In order to communicate the risk of fire
to community the town uses the National Fire Danger Warning System. Extreme
means fires start quickly, spread furiously, and burn intensely. All fires are
potentially serious. Development into high intensity burning will usually be
faster and occur from smaller fires than in the very high danger class. Direct
attack is rarely possible and may be dangerous except immediately after
ignition. Fires that develop headway in heavy slash or dense stands of trees
may be unmanageable while extreme burning conditions lasts. Under these
conditions the only effective and safe control action is on the flanks until
the weather  changes, or the fuel supply lessens.
      (4)   RED FLAG WARNING. A forecast warning issued by the National Weather
Service in the United States to inform the public, firefighters, and land
management agencies that conditions are ideal for wildland fire and other
combustion, and rapid spread.
      (5)   RESIDENTIAL YARDS. An enclosed section of private residential
property that has had all combustible ground cover removed from the area.
      (6)    VEHICLE. A fully enclosed form of transportation with the windows
in the upright or closed position.
      (7)   VERY HIGH FIRE DANGER LEVEL. In order to communicate the risk of
fire to community the town uses the National Fire Danger Warning System. Very
High means fires start easily from all causes and, immediately after ignition,
spread rapidly and increase quickly in intensity. Spot fires are a constant
danger. Fires burning in light fuels may quickly develop high intensity
characteristics such as long-distance spotting and fire whirlwinds when they
burn into heavier fuels.
   (E)   Authority to enforce violations of this section; means of enforcement.
      (1)   The Fire Code Official or designee, any peace officer, Town
Marshal, the Town Attorney, or the Town Prosecutor may issue civil code
complaints to enforce violations of this section designated as civil offenses.
      (2)   Any person authorized pursuant to this section to issue a civil
complaint may also issue a notice of violation specifying actions to be taken
and the time in which they are to be taken to avoid the issuance of a civil
complaint.
   (F)   Liability for emergency responses related to the cause of a fire from
a violation of Stage I or Stage II restrictions or related to emergency
responses arising out of the use of motor vehicles, including (without
limitation) driving a motor vehicle into an area inundated with water.
      (1)   A person who causes a fire due to a violation of a Stage I or Stage
II restriction or who drives a vehicle into an area for which warnings have
been posted about the risk of high-water levels, is liable for the expenses of
any emergency response that is required to contain and extinguish such fire or
evacuate the person from a vehicle immobilized due to high water levels. Such
violation shall constitute negligence per se.
      (2)   The expenses of an emergency response are a charge against the
person liable for those expenses pursuant to division (F)(1) above. The charge
constitutes a debt of that person. The liability imposed under this section is
in addition to and not limitation of any other liability that may be imposed.
      (3)   For purposes of this division (F), the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
         (a)   EXPENSES OF AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE means reasonable costs
directly incurred by public agencies, for-profit entities or not-for-profit
entities that make an appropriate emergency response to the incident. For-
profit and not-for-profit entities may only recover the costs of such entities
if the entities responded at the request of a public agency.
         (b)   REASONABLE COSTS include the costs of providing police, fire
fighting, rescue, and emergency medical services at the scene of an incident
and the salaries of the persons who responded to the incident.
   (G)   Penalty. The penalty for violating any prohibition or requirement
imposed by this section shall be imposed pursuant to §
10.99, except that any person found to have violated any prohibition or
requirement imposed by this section within the preceding 36 months shall, in
addition to any penalty, fine or restitution payment, be guilty of a Class 1
misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $2,500, by
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, by a term of probation not
to exceed three years, or by any combination or such fine, penalty, restitution
payment, imprisonment and probation.

      3109.1 General:
      Every swimming pool shall be completely enclosed by a permanent fence,
wall or barrier to restrict access to the swimming pool from public property,
from adjacent private property, and directly from all dwelling units or guest
rooms located on the same premises as the swimming pool. These swimming pool
enclosure and barrier detail requirements apply to all new swimming pools
installed on or after the effective date of this ordinance, and to all
additions, alterations, repairs or replacements made to existing swimming pool
enclosures. All swimming pools installed before the effective date of this
ordinance shall be completely enclosed as provided by previous ordinances since
January 1, 1995.
      Exceptions:
      1.   Swimming pools built on single-family residential property on or
before the January 1, 1995, need not be retroactively fitted with a barrier
between the dwelling and the pool, provided all occupants of the dwelling are
at least six years of age or older. All other portions of the swimming pool
enclosure shall be installed and maintained as required herein. This exception
does not eliminate an owner’s responsibility for providing a temporary barrier
or otherwise physically restricting visiting children’s direct access from the
dwelling to the swimming pool. This exception shall expire and the required
permanent barrier shall be retroactively installed between the dwelling and the
swimming pool whenever one or more children under six years of age become
residents of the property.
      2.   Aboveground swimming pools which have nonclimbable sides not less
than 48 inches (1,219 mm) high above the adjacent ground level may be located
on single-family residential property without a fence or barrier between the
pool and the dwelling, provided any steps or ladder are either removable
without the use of tools, or are designed to be secured in an inaccessible
position with a lock or latch located not less than 54 inches (1,372 mm) above
the adjacent ground level.
      3109.1.1 Responsibility:
      The property owner and any other person in charge of a swimming pool
shall ensure that the required swimming pool enclosure, including all gates,
doors, locks, latches and other portions of the barrier, are maintained safe
and in good working order. No person shall alter or remove any portion of a
swimming pool enclosure except to repair, reconstruct or replace the enclosure
in compliance with this section.
      3109.2 Barrier details:
      Swimming pool barriers shall be installed as a permanent fence, a wall, a
building wall or a combination thereof, which surround the swimming pool. The
pool side of the barrier shall not be less than 20 inches (508 mm) from the
water’s edge. The top of the barrier, including all gates and doors, shall not
be less than 60 inches (1,524 mm) above the floor or underlying ground,
measured on the exterior side of the enclosure.
      There shall be no openings, holes or gaps in a swimming pool barrier
large enough for a sphere 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter to pass through.
Barrier fences or walls may not have handholds, footholds or horizontal members
accessible from the exterior side of the enclosure. Horizontal members of
fences shall be spaced not less than 45 inches (1,143 mm) apart, measured
vertically, or shall be placed on the pool side of a fence that has no opening
greater than 1.75 inches (44 mm) measured horizontally. Wire mesh or chain link
fences may have a maximum mesh size of 1.75 inches (44 mm) measured
horizontally.
      Exception:
      Barrier fences or walls not less than 54 inches (1,372 mm) in height,
which existed on or before January 1, 1995, may be used for that portion of the
required swimming pool enclosure that separates a swimming pool from dwellings
located on the same premises as the pool, provided such barrier is kept in
repair and is otherwise maintained in compliance with all other provisions of
this section.
      3902.2.1 Gates:
      All gates in a swimming pool barrier shall be equipped to accommodate a
locking device. All pedestrian access gates shall be self-closing and self-
latching. All pedestrian access gates installed after January 1, 1995, shall
open outward away from the pool. Gates other than pedestrian access gates need
not be self-closing or self-latching when they are kept secured by a padlock or
similar locking device. Gate latches shall be located not less than 54 inches
(1,372 mm) above the underlying ground or shall otherwise be made inaccessible
from the outside to small children.
      3902.2.2 Doors:
      All doors leading from a dwelling or guest room directly into a swimming
pool enclosure shall be self-closing and self-latching, and shall be equipped
with a locking device. When a simple latch is used, the release mechanism for
the latch, or a secondary locking device, shall be located not less than 54
inches (1,372 mm) above the floor. A locking latch that uses a key, electronic
opener, or integral combination lock may be located at any height on the door.
Sliding doors shall not form part of a required barrier unless their self-
closing and self-latching mechanism is specifically approved by the building
official for this purpose.
      3902.2.2.1 Alarms:
      All doors with direct access to the pool may be equipped with an alarm
that produces an audible warning when the door and its screen, if present, are
opened. The alarm shall sound continuously for a minimum of 30 seconds
immediately after the door is opened and be capable of being heard throughout
the house during normal household activities. The alarm shall automatically
reset under all conditions. The alarm system shall be equipped with a manual
means, such as touch pad or switch, to temporarily deactivate the alarm or a
single opening. Such deactivation shall last for not more than 15 seconds. The
deactivation switch(es) shall be located at least 54 inches (1,372 mm) above
the threshold of the door. This alarm may be used in lieu of the door
requirements listed above.
      3902.2.3 Windows:
      Emergency escape or rescue windows from sleeping rooms that face within a
swimming pool enclosure shall be equipped with a latching device located not
less than 54 inches (1,372 mm) above the floor. All other dwelling unit or
guest room windows facing within a swimming pool enclosure shall be equipped
with a screwed-in-place wire mesh screen, a keyed lock that prevents opening
the window more than four inches, or a latching device located not less than 54
inches (1,372 mm) above the floor.
      3902.2.4 Safety covers:
      A key-operated, motorized safety cover that complies with ASTM ES 13-89
may be used to meet the requirements of this section for a barrier between a
single-family dwelling and a swimming pool accessory to that dwelling, provided
all other portions of the swimming pool enclosure are installed and maintained
as required herein. The keyed pool cover switch shall be located not less than

         (g)   Park and recreation facilities.
      (2)   Define and provide a map of one or more service areas within which
the town will provide each category of necessary public services for which
development impact fees will be charged. Each service area must be defined in a
manner that demonstrates a substantial nexus between the capital facilities to
be provided in the service area and the service units to be served by those
capital facilities. The town may cover more than one category of capital
facilities in the same service area provided that there is an independent
substantial nexus or direct benefit, as applicable, between each category of
necessary public services and the service units to be served.
      (3)   Identify and describe the land use assumptions upon which the
infrastructure improvements plan is based in each service area.
      (4)   Analyze and identify the existing level of service provided by the
town to existing service units for each category of necessary public services
in each service area.
      (5)   Identify the level of service to be provided by the town for each
category of necessary public services in each service area based on the
relevant land use assumptions and any established town standards or policies
related to required levels of service.
      (6)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the existing capacity of the capital facilities in each service area,
the utilization of those capital facilities by existing service units, and the
available excess capacity of those capital facilities to serve new service
units including any existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage
of such capacity. The infrastructure improvements plan shall additionally
identify any changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be
needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to existing service
units, or to meet new safety, efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory
requirements for services provided to existing service units.
      (7)   Identify any grandfathered facilities and the impact thereof on the
need for necessary public services in each affected service area.
      (8)   Estimate the total number of existing and future service units
within each service area based on the town's land use assumptions.
      (9)   Based on the analysis in divisions (3) through (6) above, provide a
summary table or tables describing the level of service for each category of
necessary public services by relating the required capital facilities to
service units in each service area, and identifying the applicable service unit
factor associated with each category of development.
      (10)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing
capital facilities, and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be
required to provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service
area as a result of the new projected service units in that service area, for a
period not to exceed ten years. Nothing in this division shall prohibit the
town from additionally including in its infrastructure improvements plan
projected utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer
than ten years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded
from the development fee calculation.
      (11)   For each category of necessary public services, estimate the total
cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital facilities
that will be required to serve new service units, including costs of land
acquisition, improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies
leading to design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs,
as well as projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include
costs for ongoing operation and maintenance of capital facilities, nor for
replacement of capital facilities to the extent that such replacement is
necessary to serve existing service units. If the infrastructure improvements
plan includes changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be
needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to existing service
units, or to meet new regulatory requirements for services provided to existing
service units, such costs shall be identified and distinguished in the
infrastructure improvements plan.
      (12)   Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other
sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities
identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, which shall include
estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad
valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and
the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based
on the approved land use assumptions. The infrastructure improvements plan
shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct and
implement the new or expanded capital facilities.
      (13)   Calculate required offsets as follows:
         (a)   From the forecasted revenues in division (12) above, identify
those sources of revenue that:
            1.   Are attributable to new development; and
            2.   Will contribute to paying for the capital costs of necessary
public services.
         (b)   For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to
division (13)(a), calculate the relative contribution of each category of
development to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services in
each service area.
         (c)   Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to
division (13)(b) above, for each category of necessary public services,
calculate the total offset to be provided to each category of development in
each service area.
         (d)   For each category of necessary public services, convert the
total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service
area into an offset amount per service unit by dividing the total offset for
each category of development by the number of service units associated with
that category of development.
         (e)   Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the
required offset, if the town imposes a construction, contracting, or similar
excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege
tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax
classifications in the town, the entire excess portion of the construction,
contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the
capital costs of necessary public services provided to new development unless
the excess portion is already taken into account for such purpose pursuant to
this section.
         (f)   In determining the amount of required offset for land included
in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter
4, Article 6, the town shall take into account any capital facilities provided
by the district that are included in the infrastructure improvements plan and
the capital costs paid by the district for such capital facilities, and shall
offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district
proportionally.
   (B)   Multiple plans. An infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant
to this division may address one or more of the town's categories of necessary
public services in any or all of the town's service areas. Each capital
facility shall be subject to no more than one infrastructure improvements plan
at any given time.
   (C)   Reserved capacity. The town may reserve capacity in an infrastructure
improvements plan to serve one or more planned future developments, including
capacity reserved through a development agreement pursuant to §
151.51. All reservations of existing capacity must be disclosed in the
infrastructure improvements plan at the time it is adopted.

§ 151.147 ADOPTION AND MODIFICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Adopting or amending the infrastructure improvements plan. The
infrastructure improvements plan shall be adopted or amended subject to the
following procedures:
      (1)   Major amendments to the infrastructure improvements plan. Except as
provided in division (2) of this section, the adoption or amendment of an
infrastructure improvements plan shall occur at one or more public hearings
according to the following schedule, and may occur concurrently with the
adoption of an update of the town's land use assumptions as provided in §
151.45:
         (a)   Sixty days before the first public hearing regarding a new or
updated infrastructure improvements plan, the town shall provide public notice
of the hearing and post the infrastructure improvements plan and the underlying
land use assumptions on its website; the town shall additionally make available
to the public the documents used to prepare the infrastructure improvements
plan and underlying land use assumptions and any proposed changes to capital
facilities.
         (b)   The town shall conduct a public hearing on the infrastructure
improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions at least 30 days, but no
more than 60 days, before approving or disapproving the infrastructure
improvements plan.
      (2)   Minor amendments to the infrastructure improvements plan.
Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, the town may update the
infrastructure improvements plan and/or its underlying land use assumptions
without a public hearing if all of the following apply:
         (a)   The changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the
underlying land use assumptions will not add any new category of necessary
public services to any service area.
         (b)   The changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the
underlying land use assumptions will not increase the level of service to be
provided in any service area.
         (c)   Based on an analysis of the fee report and the town's adopted
development impact fee schedules, the changes in the infrastructure
improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions would not,
individually or cumulatively with other amendments undertaken pursuant to this
division, have caused a development impact fee in any service area to have been
increased by more than 5% above the development impact fee that is provided in
the current development impact fee schedule.
         (d)   At least 30 days prior to the date that any amendment pursuant
to this section is adopted, the town shall post the proposed amendments on the
town website.
   (B)   Amendments to the fee report. Any adoption or amendment of a fee
report and fee schedule shall occur at one or more public hearings according to
the following schedule:
      (1)   The first public hearing on the fee report must be held at least 30
days after the adoption or approval of an infrastructure improvements plan as
provided in division (A) of this section. The town must give at least 30 days’
notice prior to the hearing, provided that this notice may be given on the same
day as the approval or disapproval of the infrastructure improvements plan.
      (2)   The town shall make the infrastructure improvements plan and
underlying land use assumptions available to the public on the town's website
30 days prior to the public hearing described in division (B)(1).
      (3)   The fee report may be adopted by the town no sooner than 30 days,
and no later than 60 days, after the hearing described in division (B)(1).
      (4)   The development impact fee schedules in the fee report adopted
pursuant to this section shall become effective after adoption of the fee
report by the town, at the time set forth in A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
(Res. R2019-07, passed 5-6-19; Am. Ord. O2019-03, passed 5-20-19)
§ 151.48 TIMING FOR THE RENEWAL AND UPDATING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
PLAN AND THE LAND USE ASSUMPTIONS.
   (A)   Renewing the infrastructure improvements plan. Except as provided in
division (B) of this section, not later than every five years the town shall
update the applicable infrastructure improvements plan and fee report related
to each category of necessary public services pursuant to §
151.47 above. Such five-year period shall be calculated from the date of the
adoption of the infrastructure improvements plan or the date of the adoption of
the fee report, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   Determination of no changes. Notwithstanding division (A) of this
section, if the town determines that no changes to an infrastructure
improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, or fee report are needed,
the town may elect to continue the existing infrastructure improvements plan
and fee report without amendment by providing notice as follows:
      (1)   Notice of the determination shall be published at least 90 days
prior to the end of the five-year period described in division (A) of this
section.
      (2)   The notice shall identify the infrastructure improvements plan and
fee report that shall continue in force without amendment.
      (3)   The notice shall provide a map and description of the service area
(s) covered by such infrastructure improvements plan and fee report.
      (4)   The notice shall identify an address to which any resident of the
town may submit, within 60 days, a written request that the town update the
infrastructure improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, and/or fee
report and the reasons and basis for the request.
   (C)   Response to comments. The town shall consider and respond to any
timely requests submitted pursuant to division (B)(4) of this section.
(Res. R2019-07, passed 5-6-19; Am. Ord. O2019-03, passed 5-20-19)
§ 151.49 COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Collection. Development impact fees, together with administrative
charges assessed pursuant to division (A)(6) of this section, shall be
calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence
development; specifically:
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement
adopted pursuant to §
151.51, development impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building
permit according to the current development impact fee schedule for the
applicable service area(s), or according to any other development impact fee
schedule as authorized in these provisions.
      (2)   If a building permit is not required for the development, but water
or wastewater connections are required, any and all development impact fees due
shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased. If only a
wastewater connection is required, the development impact fees shall be paid
prior to approval of a connection to the sewer system. If determined to be in
the best interests of the town, in its sole discretion, wastewater development
impact fees shall be assessed if a development either: (i) connects to the
public sewer; or (ii) as determined by the Town Manager or designee, is capable
of discharging sewage to a town public sewer.
      (3)   If the development is located in a service area with a storm water,
drainage, and flood control development impact fee, and a building permit,
water, or sewer service connection is required, the storm drainage development
impact fee due shall be paid at the time any permit is issued for the
development.
      (4)   No building permit, water or sewer connection, certificate of
completion, or certificate of occupancy shall be issued if a development impact
fee is not paid as directed in the previous divisions. If a building permit is
issued in error, or if construction is commenced without proper authorization,
the building permit may be revoked and work on the property ceased until the
development impact fee is paid in full.
      (5)   If the building permit is for a change in the type of building use,
an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a
residential or non-residential point of demand to the water or wastewater
system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service
units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development
impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type.
      (6)   For issued building permits that expire or are voided, development
impact fees and administrative charges shall be as follows:
         (a)   If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or
voided permit, and the development impact fees paid for such development have
not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any
development impact fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the
fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed.
         (b)   If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being
sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit applicant
shall pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in
effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original
permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit
applicant, the new permit applicant shall pay development impact fees as if it
were the original permittee.
   (B)   Exceptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either of
the following conditions:
      (1)   Development impact fees have been paid for the development and the
building permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development impact fees
have not expired or been voided.
      (2)   The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development impact
fees involve modifications to existing residential or non-residential
development that do not: (a) add new service units; (b) increase the impact of
existing service units on existing or future capital facilities; or (c) change
the land-use type of the existing development to a different category of
development for which a higher development impact fee would have been due. To
the extent that any modification does not meet the requirements of this
division, the development impact fee due shall be the difference between the
development impact fee that was or would have been due on the existing
development and the development impact fee that is due on the development as
modified.
   (C)   Temporary freezing of development impact fee schedules. New
developments in the town shall be temporarily exempt from increases in
development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or modified
development impact fee schedules as follows:
      (1)   On or after the day that the first building permit is issued for a
single-family residential development, the town may, and at the permittee's
request shall, provide the permittee with an applicable "grandfathered"
development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24
months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which
shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter.
During the effective period of the applicable "grandfathered" development
impact fee schedule, the developer shall pay the fees on that schedule, and any
building permit issued for the same single-family residential development shall
not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee schedule.
      (2)   On or after the day that the final approval, as defined in A.R.S. §
9-463.05(T)(4), is issued for a commercial or multifamily development, the town
shall provide an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in
force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that final development
approval of a site plan is given, and which shall expire at the end of the
first business day of the 25th month thereafter. During the effective period of
the applicable development impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for
the same development shall not be subject to any new or modified development
impact fee schedule.
      (3)   Any category of development not covered under divisions (C)(1) and
(2) shall pay development impact fees according to the fee schedule that is
current at the time of collection as specified in division (A) of this section.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, if changes
are made to a development's final site plan that will increase the number of
service units after the issuance of a "grandfathered" development impact fee
schedule, the town may assess any new or modified development impact fees
against the additional service units.
      (5)   If the town reduces the amount of an applicable development impact
fee during the period that a grandfathered development impact fee schedule is
in force, the town shall assess the lower development impact fee.
   (D)   Option to pursue special fee determination. Where a development is of
a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development
appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development
has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated
with providing necessary public services to that development will differ
substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified
category of development, the town may require the applicant to provide the Town
Manager or designee with an alternative development impact fee analysis. Based
on a projection of the actual burdens and costs that will be associated with
the development, the alternative development impact fee analysis may propose a
unique development impact fee for the development based on the application of
an appropriate service unit factor, or may propose that the development be
covered under the development impact fee schedule governing a different and
more analogous category of development. The Town Manager or designee shall
review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall make a determination as to
the development impact fee to be charged. Such decision shall be appealable
pursuant to § 151.52 below. The Town Manager or designee may require the
applicant to pay an administrative fee to cover the actual costs of reviewing
the special fee determination application.

§ 151.50 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE CREDITS AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Eligibility of capital facility. All development impact fee credits
must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   One of the following is true:
         (a)   The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward a
capital facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit
will be issued, must be identified in an adopted infrastructure improvements
plan and fee report as a capital facility for which a development impact fee
was assessed; or
         (b)   The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town
that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility
should have been included in the infrastructure improvements plan in lieu of a
different capital facility that was included in the infrastructure improvements
plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject
capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the
town shall amend the infrastructure improvements plan to:
            1.   Include the subject replacement facility; and
            2.   Delete the capital facility that will be replaced.
      (2)   Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a
developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by
the town through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the
developer will be paid or reimbursed by the town for any contribution, payment,
construction, or dedication from any town funding source including an agreement
to reimburse the developer with future collected development impact fees
pursuant to §
151.51, any credits claimed by the developer shall be:
         (a)   Deducted from any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the town;
or
         (b)   Reduced by the amount of such payment or reimbursement.
   (B)   Eligibility of subject development. To be eligible for a credit, the
subject development must be located within the service area of the eligible
capital facility.
   (C)   Calculation of credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the
costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted infrastructure
improvements plan for which a development impact fee was assessed pursuant to
the fee report. If the gross impact fee for a particular category of necessary
public service is adopted at an amount lower than the maximum amount justified
by the fee report, the amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to
the difference between the maximum amount justified by the fee report and the
gross impact fee adopted. A credit shall not exceed the actual costs the
applicant incurred in providing the eligible capital facility.
   (D)   Allocation of credits. Before any credit can be issued to a subject
development (or portion thereof), the credit must be allocated to that
development as follows:
      (1)   The developer and the town must execute a credit agreement
including all of the following:
         (a)   The total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an
eligible capital facility.
         (b)   The estimated number of service units to be served within the
subject development.
         (c)   The method by which the credit values will be distributed within
the subject development.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of
development impact fee credits through an application for a credit agreement
(which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to §
151.51).
      (3)   If a building permit is issued or a water/sewer connection is
purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a credit
agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated
retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any
remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this
subchapter.
      (4)   If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or
relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior
to execution of a credit agreement or development agreement, credits resulting
from the eligible capital facility will only be allocated to the development if
the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor(s)
in interest for the subject development.
      (5)   If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible capital facility,
all such entities must collectively enter into a single credit agreement with
the town, and any request for the allocation of credit within the subject
development(s) must be made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible
capital facility.
      (6)   Credits may only be reallocated from or within a subject
development with the town's approval of an amendment to an executed credit
agreement, subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town,
or its legal successor in interest and the entity that currently controls the
subject development are parties to the request for reallocation.
         (b)   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
credits already issued for the subject development.
      (7)   A credit agreement may authorize the allocation of credits to a
noncontiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town or
its legal successor in interest, the entity that currently controls the subject
development, and the entity that controls the noncontiguous parcel are parties
to the request for reallocation.
         (b)   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
credits already issued for the subject development.
         (c)   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that
served by the eligible capital facility.
         (d)   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service
from the eligible capital facility.
         (e)   The credit agreement specifically states the value of the
credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or service unit, or establishes a
mechanism for future determination of the credit values.
         (f)   The credit agreement does not involve the transfer of credits to
or from any property subject to a development agreement.
   (E)   Credit agreement. Credits shall only be issued pursuant to a credit
agreement executed in accordance with division (D) of this section. The Town
Manager or designee is authorized by this subchapter to enter into a credit
agreement with the controlling entity of a subject development, subject to the
following:
      (1)   The developer requesting the credit agreement shall provide all
information requested by the town to allow it to determine the value of the
credit to be applied.
      (2)   An application for a credit agreement shall be submitted to the
town by the developer within one year of the date on which ownership or control
of the capital facility passes to the town.
      (3)   The developer shall submit a draft credit agreement to the Town
Manager or designee for review in the form provided to the applicant by the
town. The draft credit agreement shall include, at a minimum, all of the
following information and supporting documentation:
         (a)   A legal description and map depicting the location of the
subject development for which credit is being applied. The map shall depict the
location of the capital facilities that have been or will be provided.
         (b)   An estimate of the total service units that will be developed
within the subject development depicted on the map and described in the legal
description.
         (c)   A list of the capital facilities, associated physical
attributes, and the related costs as stated in the infrastructure improvements
plan.
         (d)   Documentation showing the date(s) of acceptance by the town, if
the capital facilities have already been provided.
         (e)   The total amount of credit to be applied within the subject
development and the calculations leading to the total amount of credit.
         (f)   The credit amount to be applied to each service unit within the
subject development for each category of necessary public services.
      (4)   The town's determination of the credit to be allocated is final.
      (5)   Upon execution of the credit agreement by the town and the
applicant, credits shall be deemed allocated to the subject development.
      (6)   Any amendment to a previously-approved credit agreement must be
initiated within two years of the town's final acceptance of the eligible
capital facility for which the amendment is requested.
      (7)   Any credit agreement approved as part of a development agreement
shall be amended in accordance with the terms of the development agreement and
§
151.51.
   (F)   Issuance of credits. Credits allocated pursuant to division (D) of
this section may be issued and applied toward the gross impact fees due from a
development, subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Credits issued for an eligible capital facility may only be applied
to the development impact fee due for the applicable category of necessary
public services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another category of
necessary public services.
      (2)   Credits shall only be issued when the eligible capital facility
from which the credits were derived has been accepted by the town or when
adequate security for the completion of the eligible capital facility has been
provided in accordance with all terms of an executed development agreement.
      (3)   Where credits have been issued pursuant to division (F)(2) of this
section, a development impact fee due at the time a building permit is issued
shall be reduced by the credit amount stated in or calculated from the executed
credit agreement. Where credits have not yet been issued, the gross impact fee
shall be paid in full, and a refund of the credit amount shall be due when the
developer demonstrates compliance with division (F)(2) of this section in a
written request to the town.
      (4)   Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to
another building permit or parcel, except that credits may be released for
reuse on the same subject development if a building permit for which the
credits were issued has expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a
refund under §
151.53.
      (5)   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this §
151.50, credits issued prior to January 1, 2012, may only be used for the
subject development for which they were issued. Such credits may be transferred
to a new owner of all or part of the subject development in proportion to the
percentage of ownership in the subject development to be held by the new owner.
(Res. R2019-07, passed 5-6-19; Am. Ord. O2019-03, passed 5-20-19)
§ 151.51 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   Development agreements containing provisions regarding development impact
fees, development impact fee credits, and/or disbursement of revenues from
development impact fee accounts shall comply with the following:
   (A)   Development agreement required. A development agreement is required to
authorize any of the following:
      (1)   To issue credits prior to the town's acceptance of an eligible
capital facility.
      (2)   To allocate credits to a parcel that is not contiguous with the
subject development and that does not meet the requirements of §
151.50(D)(7).
      (3)   To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using
funds from development impact fee accounts.
      (4)   To allocate different credit amounts per service unit to different
parcels within a subject development.
      (5)   For a single family residential dwelling unit, to allow development
impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit
as provided in this section.
   (B)   General requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared and
executed in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and any applicable requirements
of the town code. Except where specifically modified by this section, all
provisions of §
151.50 above shall apply to any credit agreement that is authorized as part of
a development agreement.
   (C)   Early credit issuance. A development agreement may authorize credit
issuance prior to acceptance of an eligible capital facility by the town when
the development agreement specifically states the form and value of the
security (for example, bond, letter of credit) to be provided to the town prior
to credit issuance. The Town Attorney shall determine the acceptable form and
value of the security to be provided.
   (D)   Non-contiguous credit allocation. A development agreement may
authorize the allocation of credits to a non-contiguous parcel only if all of
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that
served by the eligible capital facility.
      (2)   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from
the eligible capital facility.
      (3)   The development agreement specifically states the value of the
credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or service unit, or establishes a
mechanism for future determination of the credit values.
   (E)   Uneven credit allocation. If the credits are not to be allocated
evenly, the development agreement must specify how credits will be allocated
amongst different parcels on a per-service-unit basis. If the development
agreement is silent on this topic, all credits will be allocated evenly amongst
all parcels on a per-service-unit basis.
   (F)   Use of reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from development
impact fee accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be
utilized in accordance with applicable law for the use of town funds in
construction or acquisition of capital facilities, including A.R.S. § 34-201 et
seq.
   (G)   Deferral of fees. A development agreement may provide for the deferral
of payment of development impact fees for a residential development beyond the
issuance of a building permit; provided that a development impact fee may not
be paid later than 15 days after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
for that dwelling unit. The development agreement shall provide for the value
of any deferred development impact fees to be supported by appropriate
security, including a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash bond, in a form
and amount approved by the Town Attorney.
   (H)   Waiver of fees. If the town agrees to waive any development impact
fees assessed on development in a development agreement, the town shall
reimburse, from other sources, the appropriate development impact fee account
for the amount that was waived.
   (I)   No obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the town to enter
into any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit agreement
permitted by this section.

§ 151.52 APPEALS.
   A development impact fee determination by town staff may be appealed in
accordance with the following procedures:
   (A)   Limited scope. An appeal shall be limited to disputes regarding the

§ 151.53 REFUNDS OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current
owner of property within the town who submits a written request to the town and
demonstrates that:
      (1)   The building permit(s) that triggered the collection of the
development impact fee have expired or been voided prior to the commencement of
the development for which the permits were issued and the development impact
fees collected have not been expended, encumbered, or pledged for the repayment
of financing or debt; or
      (2)   The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in
interest paid a development impact fee for the applicable capital facility on
or after August 1, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists:
         (a)   The capital facility designed to serve the subject real property
has been constructed, has the capacity to serve the subject real property and
any development for which there is reserved capacity, and the sendee which was
to be provided by that capital facility has not been provided to the subject
real property from that capital facility or from any other infrastructure.
         (b)   After collecting the development impact fee to construct a
capital facility the town fails to complete construction of the capital
facility within the time period identified in the infrastructure improvements
plan, as it may be amended, and the corresponding service is otherwise
unavailable to the subject real property from that capital facility or any
other infrastructure.
         (c)   For a category of necessary public services other than water or
wastewater facilities, any part of a development impact fee is not spent within
ten years of the town's receipt of the development impact fee. For the purpose
of determining whether fees have been spent, the town shall use a first-in,
first-out process.
         (d)   Any part of a development impact fee for water or wastewater
facilities is not spent within 15 years of the town's receipt of the
development impact fee. For the purpose of determining whether fees have been
spent, the town shall use a first-in, first-out process.
         (e)   The development impact fee was calculated and collected for the
construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital facility
serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the
capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the
infrastructure improvements plan by a factor of greater than 10% or more. In
such event, the current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request
as set forth in this division (A), be entitled to a refund for the difference
between the amounts of the development impact fee charged for and attributable
to such construction cost and the amount the development impact fee would have
been calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the
fee report. The refund contemplated by this section shall relate only to the
costs specific to the construction of the applicable capital facility and shall
not include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly
incurred for construction of the capital facility that are included in the
development impact fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
   (B)   Earned interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include
any interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development impact
fee by the town from the date of collection to the date of refund; provided,
however that interest is not required to be paid if the refund is requested by
the developer or property owner due to voluntary cessation or abandonment of
work. All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time
the refund is paid.
   (C)   Refund to government. If a development impact fee was paid by a
governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity.
   (D)   Time limitation. Any refund request must be made not later than 180
days following the occurrence of any event described in divisions (A)(2)(a)-(e)
of this section.

   (A)   Split and division of land; approval. It is unlawful for any person to
sell a parcel of land located within the town which has been split or divided
from another parcel of land consisting of two and one-half acres or less until
first having applied for and been granted the approval of the split or division
by the Town Council. The Town Council shall determine before granting such
approval that:

§ 155.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   In many communities in which medical marijuana "dispensaries" have
been established, law enforcement agencies have documented the serious and
adverse impacts associated with such dispensaries. These communities and the
media have reported increased crime, including burglaries, robberies, violence,
illegal sales of marijuana to and use of marijuana by minors and others without
medical need in the areas immediately surrounding such medical marijuana
dispensaries. Other negative secondary effects include the smoking of marijuana
in public areas and adverse impacts on neighboring businesses (including odor
complaints). The town could reasonably anticipate experiencing similar adverse
impacts and effects from any marijuana dispensaries and cultivation and other
marijuana operations established in the town.
   (B)   Additionally, a number of sources, including the United States
Department of Justice's California Medical Marijuana website [which contains
various documents and reports related to issues surrounding marijuana use] and
the "White Paper on Marijuana Dispensaries" published by the California Police
Chiefs Association's Task Force on Marijuana Dispensaries (April 22, 2009),
have concluded that the establishment of marijuana dispensaries can lead to an
increase in crime. Among the crimes cited as typical examples are burglaries,
robberies, sales of illegal drugs in areas immediately surrounding such
dispensaries, as well as other public nuisances such as loitering, smoking
marijuana in public places, sales to minors and driving while under the
influence of marijuana. The Town Council finds that these data and conclusions,
experiences in other cities, towns and counties justify the implementation of
the regulatory zoning and safety measures included in this chapter.
   (C)   The provisions of this chapter are intended to acknowledge and protect
the rights of qualifying patients and their designated caregivers under the
provisions of Title 36, A.R.S. §§ 36-2801 et seq., while also protecting the
health, safety, and welfare of the public; through implementation of the Zoning
Code; and curtailing to the extent reasonably possible, the possession, use,
distribution, or cultivation of marijuana for unlawful purposes by:
      (1)   Requiring that medical marijuana businesses, operations and
facilities be operated in a manner that minimizes potential health and safety
risks and mitigates the negative impacts that a medical marijuana dispensary or
cultivation operation might have on surrounding properties and persons;
      (2)   Regulating the conduct of persons owning, operating and using
medical marijuana dispensaries and cultivation facilities in order to protect
the public health, safety and welfare; and
      (3)   Regulating the location and operation of medical marijuana
dispensaries, cultivation facilities and medical marijuana operations.
   (D)   By adoption of this chapter, the Town Council does not intend to
authorize or make legal any act that is not permitted under federal or state
law.
