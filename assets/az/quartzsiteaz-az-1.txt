GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.01 SEPTIC TANK, SCAVENGER WASTE HAULERS AND COMMERCIAL DUMP STATIONS.
   (A)   Unlawful. It is unlawful to discharge or to allow to discharge septage
and/or scavenger wastes into the system without a septage discharge permit.
   (B)   Permit to discharge. All person or companies wishing to operate a
commercial dump station, or to discharge septage or scavenger wastes into the
sewer system must first obtain a scavenger waste discharge permit from the
Department. Permit applications shall include information on company ownership,
identification and license number of all trucks to be used for delivery of
waste to sewer facilities. It shall also include truck capacity and other
information relating to the method of metering the septage or scavenger wastes
into the system. Permit applications shall be signed by a responsible owner or
manager of the company applying for permission to discharge. All waste hauling
equipment and waste collection tanks operated by companies with permits shall
be registered with the Department and shall be identifiable by display of an
assigned registration number and the truck or tank capacity in gallons.
   (C)   Permit to operate dump station. All persons wishing to operate a dump
station for the purpose of collection of septage from non-continuous sources
shall first apply for and receive a dump station permit from the Department.
All dump stations must consist of holding tanks with the capability of being
sealed and locked, thus prohibiting collection when not in use. Each tank must
be independently connected to the wastewater collection system and contain a
lockable valve by which the discharge of the collected septage shall be
regulated.
      (1)   The permits provided for in this section shall be issued by the
Department to all applicants who comply with the terms and conditions set forth
in this section and who pay the permit fee set annually by Council resolution,
which fee reasonably corresponds to the expenses incurred in processing the
application, and which fee is proportionally greater for accepting septic and/
or scavenger wastes for discharge into the system.
      (2)   The permits issued, as provided for in this section, shall expire
one year after the date of issuance.
      (3)   Non-compliance with any part of this section or subsequent
regulations shall subject the permit holder to revocation of permit to utilize
the services of the town sewer system for disposal of septic and/or scavenger
wastes. Re-issuance of permit to discharge after revocation shall be at the
discretion of the Department and shall be made subject to such conditions as it
deems appropriate.
   (D)   Regulations. The Council, by resolution, shall establish such
regulations as deemed necessary to control the discharge of scavenger wastes to
the sewer system.
   (E)   Provision of services.
      (1)   Normal wastes from septic tanks, sewage treatment plants and the
like shall with the appropriate permit be discharged routinely. Permission to
discharge other wastes that are not readily biodegradable or are not known to
be compatible to the operation of wastewater treatment plants shall be refused.
Special request shall be made to the Department prior to discharge of any
material of questionable acceptability. Some specific reasons for refusal of
service shall include:
         (a)   Material deleterious to treatment plant operation or operators,
such as oils, greases, gasoline, toxins, volatile solvents, sand, metallic
particles or paints;
         (b)   Materials which would cause unusual expense in handling and
treatment unless prior arrangements have been made for the payment of
additional costs of service; and
         (c)   Materials which would inhibit the performance of the treatment
plant, such as acids, plating wastes or toxic materials.
      (2)   The discharge of septic and/or scavenger wastes shall be permitted
only at locations and during such hours as shall be established by the
Department. The discharge of septic and/or scavenger wastes to the sewer system
at any other location is prohibited.
   (F)   Dump stations. Discharge of septage into the wastewater collection
system from commercial dump station collection tanks shall be supervised by a
Department representative according to the following procedure.
      (1)   Amount of septage collected in tank(s) shall be verified by
department representative. Tank(s) shall then be sealed by Department
representative to prevent further collection of septage.
      (2)   Tank(s) will be opened to allow septage discharge into collection
system at an acceptable discharge rate to be determined by Department
representative based upon current system loading.
      (3)   Upon notification that tank(s) are empty, a Department
representative shall unseal tank for acceptance of septage.
   (G)   Fees and charges. Fees and charges for treatment of normal septage
and/or scavenger wastes shall be based on the costs of providing such services
and on the expected overall average characteristics of such discharges which
shall be designated as 500 mg/l BOD and 500 mg/l SS. The department shall
designate characteristics on which to base charges in special situations, such
as discharges from sewage holding tanks, on submission of proof that waste
discharges have other than expected overall average concentrations and with
provision of positive identification procedures. Charges shall be billed at
monthly intervals or at the discretion of the Department and shall be
considered delinquent if not paid within 30 days of billing date. Delinquency
in payment shall be on the basis of revocation of permit. The actual rates and
categories will be set by resolution which shall be amended from time to time.
The rate shall be established in compliance with the public hearing
requirements of A.R.S. § 9-511.01. The fees shall be set periodically and shall
be based upon:
      (1)   The actual measured discharge or truck capacity as appropriate;
      (2)   The amount of BOD contained in the discharge;
      (3)   The amount of suspended solids contained in the discharge;
      (4)   A service fee for each load discharged; and
      (5)   Such other factors as are determined by the Council as pertinent.

§ 52.02 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Each permittee shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this code.
   (B)   For countermeasures to be taken by the Department to minimize damage
to the sanitary sewer system and/or degradation of the receiving waters, the
permittee shall notify the Department immediately upon accidentally discharging
wastes in violation of this code. This notification shall be followed within 15
days of the date of occurrence by a detailed written statement describing
causes of the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent
future occurrence. Such notification will not relieve the permittee of
liability for any expense, loss or damage to the sanitary sewer system or for
any fines imposed on the Department on account thereof and/or for any
enforcement action pursuant to this occurrence.
   (C)   In order that officers, agents and employees of permittees be informed
of the Department’s requirements, the permittee shall make available to their
employees copies of this code, together with such other wastewater information
and notices which may be furnished by the Department from time to time for the
purpose of improving and making more effective water pollution control. A
notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on the permittee’s bulletin
board advising officers, agents and employees whom to call in case of an
accidental discharge in excess of the limits authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Any possible connection or entry point for a hazardous and/or
prohibited substance to the permittee’s plumbing or drainage system shall be
appropriately labeled to warn operating personnel against discharge of such
substance in violation of this section.
(Prior Code, § 16-2-5)
§ 52.03 DISCHARGE RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   The Department shall determine the acceptability or unacceptability of
any discharge to the system. Such a determination shall be made on the basis of
sound engineering and operational evaluations, taking into consideration the
nature and concentration of the discharge, its point of entry into the system,
its compatibility with other discharges in the system, its compatibility with
the treatment facility receiving it and all other factors pertinent to the
effect of the discharge on any part of the system or treatment process. The
Department shall impose charges on any user of the sewage works who discharges
wastes having a strength greater than normal sewage or containing non-
permissible quantities or prohibited substances into the public sewer system.
The charges so imposed shall be based on the extra costs incurred by the
Department in surveillance, sampling and testing of the discharges, additional
operating and maintenance expenses and any other actions required to identify,
handle, process or supplement normal activities due to the unauthorized
discharge of excessive strength or unusual character wastes, plus overhead
charges. Failure by a user to pay the charges and to provide such corrective
measures as may be required to prevent further unauthorized discharges, after
due notice by the Department and being given a reasonable time to comply, shall
be sufficient cause to discontinue sewer service to the premises.
   (B)   Unacceptable discharges shall include, but not necessarily be limited
to, those which have been determined by the Department to:
      (1)   Contain materials or substances which would constitute a hazard to
life of personnel engaged in inspection, maintenance and operation of the
system;
      (2)   Contain materials or substances which are toxic, as defined in this
code;
      (3)   Contain materials or substances which are in any way deleterious to
any part of the system;
      (4)   Contain concentrations of any toxic or deleterious materials or
substances in excess of any limits set thereon, in accordance with this code;
      (5)   Cause the Department to incur excessive expense in the handling or
treatment thereof;
      (6)   Be incompatible with the treatment process or inhibit the
performance of the treatment process at the town wastewater facility;
      (7)   Be of such volume or contain such BOD, suspended solids or other
material load which could cause the treatment facility to exceed its design
capabilities;
      (8)   Cause a treatment facility of the Department to fail to meet
effluent requirements set by state and federal regulatory agencies or cause
such effluent to have a degrading effect on the receiving body of water; and
      (9)   Contain viable pathogenic organisms in such quantities as to be a
hazard to public health.
   (C)   The Department shall refuse the service of the facilities to any
person whose discharge is determined by the Department to be unacceptable in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   No person shall release or cause to be released or allow to run, leak
or escape into the sewer system any discharge containing any materials or
substances considered by the Department to be toxic, as defined in this code,
or to be in any way deleterious to any part of the sewer system or treatment
process. Certain materials shall, by their nature, be considered by the
Department to be toxic or deleterious, except in small quantities or
concentrations. Such materials or substances shall include by not necessarily
be limited to:
      (1)   Construction materials, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings,
metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastic, wood, paunch manure, fur, waste or
any solid or viscous substance capable of or causing obstruction to the flow in
sewers or other interference with the proper operation of the sewer system;
      (2)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or
explosive liquids, solids or gases;
      (3)   Steam or hot water above 105°F (40°C);

emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances which may
solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 33°F and 150°F (1°C and
65°C);
      (5)   Any water or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 9.5
or having any other corrosive property apt to cause damage or hazard to
structures, equipment of the sewer system or personnel employed in its
operation;
      (6)   Any water or waste contain readily releasable cyanide (cyanide
released at a temperature of 150°F/65° and pH=2.5) in excess of two mg/l; any
water or water containing total cyanide in excess of five mg/l;
      (7)   Coal tar, its derivatives and waste;
      (8)   Any liquids or wastes containing toxic, radioactive, poisonous or
other substances in sufficient quantities or rate of flow as to injure or
interfere with any of the sewage treatment process, to cause corrosive
structural damage, to constitute a hazard to human beings or animals or to
create any hazard in the receiving waters; and
      (9)   Any storm water, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, surface
drainage, cooling water or unpolluted process water.
   (E)   Certain toxic substances and pathogenic bacteria, admission of which
into the system would otherwise be prohibited, shall be acceptable in a
discharge if reduced by treatment at the source to a point that it will meet
the general purposes of these rules and regulations or come within any
applicable standards set thereon now or hereafter in accordance with these
regulations, or discharge in such small concentrations so as to not be
injurious to personnel; sewers; any biochemical, biological or other sewage
treatment process or receiving water. Such substances shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to:

      (4)   Any strong reducing agents such as nitrates, sulfides, sulfites and
thiosulfates; and
      (5)   Any waste from industrial process, hospital procedures or
commercial processes containing viable pathogenic organisms.
   (F)   The following table lists the maximum allowable values of certain
materials in or characteristics of wastewater entering the sewer system. The
Department reserves the right to establish standards for substances not
contained in this list. In setting additional standards, the Department will
generally follow the standards of the Water Pollution Control Federation. In
defining and interpreting the values of the following table, reference shall be
made to Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, American
Waterworks Association, latest edition.
   (G)   (1)   Any discharge to the sewer system containing garbage may be made
acceptable by means of grinding and dilution; provided, however, that, the
installation of and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor are
subject to review and approval by the Department prior to such installation and
operation and are subject to periodic inspection by the Department thereafter.

      (2)   The above limitations are intended to apply generally to all
industrial users within the sewer system. If, and when, state and federal
regulatory agency regulations require a specific pretreatment concentration for
a specific industry, whichever is the more stringent concentration level
between these regulations shall apply.
(Prior Code, § 16-2-6)
§ 52.04 INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Pretreatment will be required in the following instances and the
Department shall submit to the applicant the pretreatment levels which must be
obtained.
      (1)   If the Department determines upon the initial application for a
permit under this section that the proposed industrial waste must be pretreated
by the applicant to lower the level of any of the components of the industrial
waste discharge to the sewer.
      (2)   In the event that the Department must improve the discharge from
its wastewater treatment plant or plants, the Department shall require that a
permit holder install or enlarge pretreatment facilities to lower the affected
component of the permittee’s industrial waste discharge.
      (3)   If any wastewater prohibited under the conditions of this code is
produced, such producer shall pretreat the wastewater to the extent required to
comply with the standards established herein before discharging to any sewer.
      (4)   The acceptability of a pretreatment method for any given discharge,
an application for which has been made in accordance with this section and the
terms for the installation and use thereof, shall be reviewed by the
Department. Such a review shall be made on the basis of sound engineering and
operational evaluation, taking into consideration all factors pertinent to the
effect of the discharge, both before and after pretreatment on any part of the
system.
      (5)   Pretreatment facilities shall at all times be subject to inspection
by the Department in order to determine if such facilities are efficiently
performing the function for which they are installed.
      (6)   If the Department determines that a permittee, because of plant
expansion and/or changes in plant operations, has increased either the strength
or volume of the discharge, the Department may require additional pretreatment
to lower the level of the volume and/or any components of the industrial waste
before discharge, unless such permittee has previously made industrial cost
recovery payment for reservation of additional industrial capacity.
      (7)   Pretreatment facilities required under divisions (A)(1) through (A)
(7) above shall be provided, operated and maintained at the permit holder’s
expense.
   (B)   Any sludge or other material removed from the industrial waste by the
pretreatment facility shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable
federal, state and local laws.
   (C)   (1)   Dilution of waste discharged to the sanitary sewer system is
prohibited, whether accomplished by the combination of two or more waste
streams by a producer or producers, or by the addition of other liquids solely
for the purpose of diluting the quality of the waste discharge.
      (2)   One or more producers may, upon application and approval by the
Department, combine industrial waste streams prior to discharge to the town
sanitary sewer system if, and only if, such combination of industrial waste
streams produces a combined discharge of better quality than the two industrial
waste streams would have been if discharged separately. However, if one or more
producers are allowed to mix industrial waste streams to produce a better
discharge, the user charge established herein, based on the quality of its
industrial waste streams prior to combination, shall be paid to the town.
   (D)   (1)   Detailed plans showing any pretreatment facilities shall be
submitted to the Department for approval before construction of the facilities.
The review of such plans will in no way relieve such permit holders from the
responsibility of modifying and operating the facilities to produce an effluent
complying with the established conditions of the permit and federal
regulations. Any subsequent, significant changes in the approved facilities or
methods of operation shall be reported to the Department and must be reviewed
and approved by the Department as complying with the provisions herein
established.
      (2)   Furthermore, all facilities, methods of operation and discharges
must comply with the rules and regulations contained in 40 C.F.R. part 403.
   (E)   After the construction plans for such pretreatment plants have been
approved and a permit issued, the plans shall be placed on file in permanent
reproducible form with the Department without cost to the Department before a
connection permit will be issued.
(Prior Code, § 16-2-7)
§ 52.05 VIOLATIONS.

   (A)   All property owners desiring the connection of the improvements on
their property to the sewer system of the town shall grant to the town, at no
charge, those easements necessary to properly effectuate the sewer connection
desired.
   (B)   All easements granted to the town shall be subject to the following
restrictions and conditions of use.
      (1)   No person, firm or corporation having charge of property subject to
easement in favor of the town shall hereafter construct, build or establish a
building upon the property subject to said easement. A BUILDING means a house,
commercial building, industrial building or any structure of a size or
construction that the moving thereof would cause great inconvenience to any
person.
      (2)   Should the owner of the property subject to an easement in favor of
the town construct a building thereon in violation of this code, the town shall
employ individuals to clear said property and charge the costs of the same to
the owner of the property. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the town to
compensate the owner of the property subject to the easement for the value of a
“building” cleared. The town shall take those steps as are required to work in
the easement and preserve the improvement, rather than clear the improvements.
   (C)   No person shall excavate deeper than three feet upon the property
subject to the easement in favor of the town without having first obtained a
permit therefor, as herein required. Such permit shall be issued by the town.
Applications for a permit to excavate upon property subject to easement in
favor of the town shall be made in writing to the town and shall state thereon
specifically the size of the space intended to be excavated and the purpose for
the excavation.
   (D)   No person shall plant any trees or shrubbery upon the property subject
to the easement in favor of the town without having secured a permit therefor.
Applications for such permit shall be made to the town. All trees and shrubs so
planted shall be placed subject to the direction and approval of the town. No
boulders, benches or fences shall be built or maintained upon the property
subject to the easement unless approved by the town.
   (E)   In the event any improvements are constructed within the boundaries of
the easement and these create any additional costs to the town because it must
incur additional expenses to repair, install or replace its sewer, the property
owner shall be charged all additional costs incurred.

§ 52.39 DETERMINATION OF WASTEWATER QUALITY.
   For industrial discharges, wastewater quality shall be determined from
actual testing or from historical data, whichever is appropriate. The Council,
on recommendation of the Town Manager, shall, as necessary, modify these
determinations and/or revise classifications in a continuing attempt to
maintain equitable charges for the service required.
   (A)   Testing by direct sampling, utilizing recognized field techniques,
equipment and procedures shall be used for all industrial users. The BOD5 test
shall be considered the standard test; however COD or TOC tests may be
substituted in cases where it has been determined by the Wastewater Treatment
Department that the BOD5 test is not representative of actual wastewater
loading. Wastewater characteristics shall be determined by the Wastewater
Treatment Department on the basis of monitored wastewater discharged, a
certified statement from the user or on the best available data as to the
characteristics of such discharges.
   (B)   Any change in the ongoing process(es) employed by a user contributing
industrial waste which results in a variation of more than 25% in one or more
of the effluent loading concentrations shall be reported to the Wastewater
Treatment Department within 30 days of such change.
   (C)   If it is determined through testing that a significant variation
exists between the user’s certified data and the discharge characteristics
monitored by the Wastewater Treatment Department, the Department shall adjust
the sewer use charge based on the monitored data from the original date of
certification, unless written communication has occurred, notifying the
Wastewater Treatment Department of changes in loading and giving specific dates
of changes.
   (D)   Where sampling and gauging of a specific user is not practical for
physical, economic, safety or other reasons, the Wastewater Treatment
Department shall designate values for concentrations of the wastes discharged
into the sewer system for all users in the same standard industrial
classification or sub-classification.
(Prior Code, § 16-2-2) (Res. 01-06, passed - -2001; Ord. 09-36, passed - -2009;

§ 52.40 SEWER SYSTEM CAPACITY FEE.
   (A)   For the purpose of providing revenue to assist in the financing and to
more equitably distribute the cost of the construction of necessary additions
to the sewer system and the sewage treatment facilities, it is hereby
determined and declared necessary to provide for the establishment, exaction
and regulation of a sewer capacity charge as hereinafter determined, with such
charge to be in addition to any and all other fees which shall be imposed with
respect to the said sewer system.
   (B)   The funds received from the collection of such charge, as it is herein
authorized, shall be deposited daily with the town who shall credit them to a
special fund from which the Council may take appropriations for the payment of
the cost and expense of the construction of the sanitary sewer system, pump
stations and sewage treatment works and for the payment of the cost and expense
of extensions to, or the enlargement of, same.
   (C)   The Department Director shall be and is hereby authorized and directed
to charge and collect a sewer system capacity charge whenever:
      (1)   A sewer system agreement has been executed by the parties;
      (2)   Application is made for the issuance of a sewer permit to provide
sanitary sewer service to a new structure;
      (3)   At the time an existing structure is enlarged or its use changes;
or
      (4)   When an existing structure is removed and a new structure built and
reuse is made of an existing sanitary sewer service or a new sanitary sewer
service is constructed, where such property is or will be tributary, directly
or indirectly to any sanitary sewer built by the town.
   (D)   Credit for any existing structure which has a use change, or for an
existing structure enlarged or removed, may be applied against the system

§ 53.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is:
   (A)   To protect the public water supply of the town from the possibility of
contamination or pollution by isolating to the consumer’s internal distribution
system(s) or the consumer’s private water system(s) contaminants or pollutants
that could backflow into the public water systems; and
   (B)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of backflow
prevention, which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination
or pollution of all potable water systems.
(Prior Code, § 17-1-9) (Ord. 00-11, passed - -2000; Ord. 01-15, passed - -2001;
Ord. 09-39, passed - -2009)
§ 53.02 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The town (“Water Department”) shall be responsible for the protection of the
public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to
the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service
connection. An approved backflow prevention assembly is required at the
consumer’s water service connection, for the safety of the water system, if any
auxiliary water supply exists. The Water Department or its designated agent
shall give notice in writing to said consumer to install such an approved
backflow prevention assembly on the consumer’s premises. The consumer shall
immediately install such an approved backflow prevention assembly at the
consumer’s own expense; and, failure, refusal or inability on the part of the
consumer to install, have tested and maintained said assembly shall constitute
grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises immediately until such
requirements have been met satisfactorily. Commercial and industrial consumers
shall be required to install an approved backflow assembly to protect the
potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution.
(Prior Code, § 17-1-9) (Ord. 00-11, passed - -2000; Ord. 01-15, passed - -2001;
Ord. 09-39, passed - -2009)
§ 53.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPROVED. A water supply that has been approved by the town’s Water
Department. The term APPROVED, as herein used in reference to an air gap, a
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly or other backflow
prevention assemblies or methods, shall mean APPROVED by the town.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the town-approved public water supply will be considered as an
AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. These AUXILIARY WATERS may include water from another
purveyor’s public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well,
spring, river, stream, harbor and the like or used waters or industrial fluids.
These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and
constitute an unacceptable water source over which the Water Department does
not have sanitary control.
   BACKFLOW. The undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and
other liquids, gases or other substances into the distribution pipes of the
potable supply of water from any source or sources. See terms BACKSIPHONAGE and
BACKPRESSURE.
   BACKPRESSURE. Any elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system (by
pump, elevation of piping or stream and/or air pressure) above the supply
pressure at the point of consideration, which would cause, or tend to cause, a
reversal of the normal direction of flow.
   BACKSIPHONAGE. A form of backflow due to a reduction in system pressure,
which causes a sub-atmospheric pressure to exist at a site in the water system.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow and includes the following.
      (1)   AIR-GAP. A physical separation between the free flowing discharge
end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving
vessel. An APPROVED AIR GAP shall be at least double the diameter of the supply
pipe measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel, in no case less
than one inch (2.54 cm).
      (2)   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An
assembly containing two independently acting approved check valves together
with a hydraulically- operating, mechanically-independent pressure differential
relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the
first check valve. The unit shall include properly located resilient seated
test cock and tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves at each end of
the assembly. This assembly is designed to protect against a non-health (i.e.,
pollutant) or a health hazard (i.e., contaminant). This assembly shall not be
used for backflow prevention of sewage or reclaimed water.
   CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of water, which creates an
actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of
disease by sewage, industrial fluids, waste and the like.
   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any unprotected actual or potential connection or
structural arrangement between the public and a consumer’s potable water system
and any other source or system through which it is possible to introduce into
any part of the potable system any used water, industrial fluid, gas or
substance other than the intended potable water with which the system is
supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel
or changeover devices and other temporary or permanent devices through which or
because of which backflow can or may occur are considered to be CROSS-
CONNECTIONS.
      (1)   The term DIRECT CROSS-CONNECTION shall mean a cross connection
which is subject to both backsiphonage and backpressure.
      (2)   The term INDIRECT CROSS-CONNECTION shall mean a cross-connection
which is subject to backsiphonage only.
   CROSS CONNECTIONS, CONTROLLED. A connection between a potable water system
and a non-potable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly
properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the
protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   HAZARD, DEGREE OF. A pollutional (non-health) or contamination (health)
hazard and is derived from the evaluation of conditions within a system.
   HAZARD, HEALTH. An actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical
or toxic nature to the public potable water system or the consumer’s potable
water system that would be a danger to health.
   HAZARD, PLUMBING. An internal or plumbing type cross-contamination in a
consumer’s potable water system that may either be a pollutional or
contamination type hazard. This includes, but is not limited to, cross-
connections to toilets, sinks, lavatories, wash trays and lawn sprinkling
systems. Plumbing-type cross-connections can be located in many types of
structures including homes, apartment houses, hotels and commercial or
industrial establishments. Such a connection, if permitted to exist, must be
properly protected by an appropriate type of backflow prevention assembly from
a pollutional or a contamination type hazard.
   HAZARD, POLLUTIONAL. An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or the potability of the public potable water
system but that would not constitute a health or system hazard, as defined. The
maximum degree or intensity of pollution to which the potable water system
could be degraded under this definition would cause a nuisance or be
aesthetically objectionable or could cause minor damage to the system or its
appurtenances.
   HAZARD, SYSTEM. An actual or potential threat of sever danger to the
physical properties of the public potable water system or of a pollutional or
contamination hazard that would have a protracted effect on the quality of the
potable water in the system.
   INDUSTRIAL FLUIDS. Any fluid or solution which may be chemically,
biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration
which would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if
introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but not be limited
to: polluted or contaminated used water; all types of process waters and used
water originating from the public potable water system which may deteriorate in
sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form, planting acids and alkalies;
circulated cooling waters connected to an opening cooling tower and/or cooling
waters that are chemically or biologically treated and stabilized with toxic
substances; contaminated by natural waters such as from wells, springs,
streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems and the
like; oils, gases, glycerin, paraffin, caustic and acid solutions and other
liquid and gaseous fluids used industrially, for other processes or for
firefighting purposes.

not create a hazard to the public health, but which does adversely and
unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such waters for domestic use.
   SERVICE PROTECTION. The appropriate type or method of backflow protection at
the service connection, commensurate with the degree of hazard of the
consumer’s potable water system.
   WATER DEPARTMENT. The Town of Quartzsite (“Water Department”) is invested
with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective
cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter.
   WATER, POTABLE. Any public water supply, that has been investigated and
approved by the state’s Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). The system
must be operating under a valid health permit. In determining what constitutes
an approved water supply, ADEQ has final judgment as to its potability.
   WATER, NON-POTABLE. A water supply that has not been approved for human
consumption by ADEQ.
   WATER, SERVICE CONNECTION. The terminal end of a service connection from the
public potable water system, (i.e., where the Water Department may lose
jurisdiction and sanitary control of the water at its point of delivery to the
consumer’s water system). If a water meter is installed at the end of the
service connection, then the SERVICE CONNECTION shall mean the downstream end
of the water meter.
   WATER, USED. Any water supplied by the Water Department, from a public
potable water system to a consumer’s water system, after it has passed through
the service connection and is no longer under the control of the Water
Department.

immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the
first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following
conditions exist:
         (a)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line
commensurate with the degree of hazard.
         (b)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any
other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an
actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system
shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree
of hazard. This shall include the handling of processed waters and waters
originating from the water purveyor’s system which have been subject to
deterioration in quality.
         (c)   In the case of premises having internal cross-connections that
cannot be permanently corrected or protected against, or intricate plumbing or
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line.
   (C)   The type of protective assembly required by divisions (C)(1), (C)(2)
and (C)(3) below shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as
follows.
      (1)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply as stated in division (B)(2)(a) above and it is not subject to any of
the following rules, the town’s system shall be protected by an approved air
gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.
      (2)   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous
to health, which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the town’s system, the town’s system shall be protected by
an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions may exist
include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.
      (3)   In the case of any premises where there are unprotected cross-
connections, either actual or potential, the town’s system shall be protected
by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly at the service connection.
      (4)   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements
or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make
a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the town’s system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap or
an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each
service to the premises.
      (5)   Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a make,
model and size approved by the town’s Water Department. An APPROVED BACKFLOW
PREVENTION ASSEMBLY shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full
conformance with the standards established by the American Waterworks
Association (AWWA) entitled: AWWA/ANS1 C511-07, Standard for Reduced Pressure
Principle Backflow Prevention Assemblies.
   (D)   It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises where backflow
prevention assemblies are installed to have an initial field test performed by
a certified backflow prevention assembly tester at the time of the initial
installation and on a yearly basis herein after the initial installation.
   (E)   The town’s Water Department shall notify the consumer when the annual
test is required. Thirty days shall be allowed for the consumer to complete the
annual test. Failure to have the approved backflow assembly tested within the
30-day time period shall result in a ten-day door notice of disconnection of
service. Upon expiration of the ten-day notice without the completion and
submission to the Water Department of a satisfactory annual test, service to
the consumer shall be disconnected. Appropriate fees shall be assessed for
disconnection and reconnection of water service to the consumer.
   (F)   In those instances where the town’s Water Department deems the hazard
to be serious in the sole discretion of the Water Department, the Water
Department may require field tests at more frequent intervals. These tests
shall be at the expense of the consumer, and shall be performed by a certified
tester approved by the town’s Water Department. It shall be the duty of the
town’s Water Department, to see that these tests are made in a timely manner.
The consumer may notify the Department in advance when the tests are to be
undertaken so that an official representative may witness the field tests, if
so desired. Backflow prevention assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled or
replaced at the expense of the consumer whenever said assemblies are found to
be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhauls shall be kept and
copies filed with the town’s Water Department.
   (G)   The town’s Water Department shall keep an inventory of all records for
a period of at least three years for State Department of Environmental Quality
inspection purposes as required.
   (H)   All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not
meet the requirements of this chapter, but were approved devices for the
purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been
properly maintained, shall, except for the testing and maintenance requirements
under division (F) above, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so
long as the town’s Water Department finds that they will satisfactorily protect
the town’s water system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present
location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the town’s Water
Department finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the
backflow prevention assembly shall be replaced by an approved backflow
prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this chapter or any related
regulation.
   (I)   All backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed to allow
adequate space for testing and maintenance; provide for adequate drainage;
allow adequate room for shut off valve rotation; allow space for attaching
fittings and hoses to test cocks; include union coupling needed for removal of
or repair to backflow; include Y-type strainer used for protection of backflow
device; include riser uprights that are copper wrapped in a minimum ten mil
wrapping tape or PVC that may be wrapped; risers shall be a minimum of 12
inches above and a maximum of 30 inches above grade; dissimilar metals shall be
avoided to prevent electrolysis by using recommended PVC; consumers shall
assure there are no physical connections between the meter and the backflow
device; install a box cover to protect the backflow from heat and freezing; and
install new pipe at a depth of no less than 18 inches.
   (J)   The town’s Water Department shall submit to the state’s Department of
Environmental Quality and the local health authority a written cross-connection
incident report within five business days of a cross-connection problem, which
has resulted in the contamination of the public water system, including the
information required in A.A.C.R. 18-4-215.H.
   (K)   The town’s Water Department is authorized to make all necessary and
reasonable rules and policies with respect to the enforcement of this chapter.
All such rules and policies shall be consistent with the provisions of this
chapter and shall be effective 30 days after being filed with the Town Clerk.

responsible party through the issuance of a notice of violation.
      (2)   A notice of violation shall include:
         (a)   The identification of the property in violation; a street

the property;
         (b)   A statement of the violations in sufficient detail to allow an

completed within a time certain as determined to be reasonable by the code
official:
               a.   Securing the excavation by completely surrounding either
the excavation or the properly with a fence or other enclosure that is at least
five feet in height at all points;

         (e)   The address and telephone number of a town representative to
contact;
         (f)   A statement describing the town’s authority to abate should the

file an appeal of the notice in the manner specified in this chapter, and that

for compliance.
      (4)   The notice shall be served upon the owner of record and/or the
responsible party in the manner described in division (E)(5) below. In
addition, the notice shall be served on the holder of any legal interest in the
property, if known to the code official, and in cases involving an order to

person duly served and shall not relieve any such person from any obligation
imposed by this chapter.
      (5)   Any notice given for any purpose under this chapter, except any
notice that includes an order to vacate or an order to abate by demolition,

responsible party. Any notice served by first class mail shall be mailed to the
last known address of the owner, the owner’s authorized agent or the owner’s
statutory agent and to the address to which the tax bill for the property was
last mailed. For any notice given under this chapter, including any notice that
includes an order to vacate or an order to abate by demolition, if personal
service or mailed service is not practicable, service of notice shall also be

a newspaper of general circulation and by posting the property for a period of
30 days. Nothing herein shall preclude the town from giving additional verbal,
written or posted notice at its discretion. If the town does elect to give any
additional notice in any instance, it shall not thereby become obligated to

a notice unless the legal entity assuming an ownership interest in such
property, in writing, assumes responsibility for compliance with the notice of
violation and a copy of such writing is presented to the code official.
      (2)   Fraudulent transfer as a misdemeanor. Any person who has been
served with a notice of violation and who then transfers an ownership interest
in the real property against which the notice has been served is guilty of a
misdemeanor if the transfer is made without first obtaining a written
acceptance of liability from the new owner for the items listed in the notice.
   (G)   Recording a violation. If there is not compliance with a notice of
violation within the time specified in the notice, and no appeal has been
properly and timely filed, the code official may record a notice of violation
with the County Recorder. A recorded notice of violation shall describe the
property and the violations and shall certify that the owner has been notified.
Whenever the corrections ordered thereafter have been completed or the building
demolished so that the violations described in the notice have been abated, the
code official shall file a new certificate with the County Recorder certifying
that all required corrections have been made and that the property is no longer
in violation of this chapter. Failure to record a notice of violation shall not
affect the validity of the notice as to persons who receive the notice.

      (1)   Jurisdiction of all proceedings to enforce the provisions of this
chapter shall be in the Town Court.

(Ord. 20-05, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 92.06 ABATEMENT OF PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   (A)   Court ordered abatement.
      (1)   Upon finding a person guilty of a violation of any provision of
this chapter, the court shall order such person to perform whatever action is
reasonably necessary to correct and abate the violations, including clean-up,
board-up, extermination, repair, rehabilitation, vacation of the building or
structure, permanently securing or filling the excavation, and/or demolition.
An abatement order shall be effective for one year unless stayed on appeal. If
stayed on appeal, the order shall be effective for one year from the end of the
appeal if the judgment and sentence are upheld. If more than one person is
guilty of a violation, such persons shall be jointly and severally responsible
for completing the abatement.
      (2)   For violations of §
94.02 of this code of ordinances, upon a finding of responsibility, the court
shall order the abatement of the offending vehicle within 30 days of judgment,
unless additional time is requested by the defendant and granted by the court.
Upon expiration of the time for abatement, and upon request by the town, the
court shall order the town to abate a violation by towing and impounding the
vehicle; and the town shall dispose of the vehicle pursuant to the procedures
for such disposal as set forth in §
94.03 of this code of ordinances.
      (3)   When the court orders abatement pursuant to this section, the court
shall advise a violator that additional fines will be imposed for failure to
abate a violation, and that the town may bring criminal charges for failure to
obey an order to abate a violation.
   (B)   Abatement by the town.
      (1)   In addition to ordering abatement of a violation as provided in
division (A) above, upon finding a person guilty of a violation of any
provision of this chapter, the court may issue an order authorizing the town to
perform whatever action is reasonably necessary to correct and abate the
violation, including clean-up, board-up, extermination, repair, rehabilitation,
vacation of the building or structure, disconnection of utilities, permanently
securing or filling the excavation and/or demolition.
      (2)   The reasonable costs of any such abatement shall be the
responsibility of the person found guilty of the violation. If more than one
person is guilty or responsible for a violation, such persons shall be jointly
and severally responsible for the costs of the abatement. The town shall pay
the cost and expense of such abatement from any appropriation made available
for that purpose and shall certify a statement of account to the Finance
Director, who shall collect the amount due, together with interest at the rate
established by law.
      (3)   Costs incurred by town arising from the town taking action to abate
a violation pursuant to a court order shall be a lien filed against the real
property that is the subject of the violation, not to exceed the estimate set
forth in the notice.
      (4)   Upon commencement of action on the property or after mailing the
statement of account to the owner or responsible party, the town shall place a
lien on the property in the amount of the cost of work performed, including
actual costs of any additional inspection and other incidental connected costs,
and for associated legal costs for abatement or injunction, but not exceeding
the estimated cost set forth in the notice, and may pursue any or all means for
recovery of cost if the lien is not paid. If the lien is paid, the town shall
remove the lien. In the event it is necessary to enforce the lien by sale, the
sale shall be made from a judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. The town
shall have the right to enforce the lien in the Superior Court of the county at
any time after recording, but failure to enforce the lien shall not affect its
validity. The recorded lien shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all
matters recited therein, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the
recording. Prior lien or liens for the purposes provided for in this chapter
shall not be a bar to a subsequent lien or liens and any number of liens on the
same parcel may be enforced in the same action.
      (5)   A lien made pursuant to this section is prior and superior to all
other liens, obligations, mortgages or other encumbrances, except liens for
general taxes.
      (6)   Any liens filed with the County Recorder pursuant to previous
provisions of this chapter or any similar chapter shall remain in effect under
the same terms and conditions that existed at the time of recording.
      (7)   The purpose of charging costs to a utility services account is to
provide a means of billing and collecting costs, rather than to create a means
of discontinuing utility services.
   (C)   Temporary abatement. If it is determined that a public nuisance as
provided in §
150.20 of this code of ordinances is a hazard to the public safety and health,
the code official may declare such structure a hazard. After notice is
communicated to any owner of record to secure the structure and the owner does
not secure the structure to town specifications, the hazard may be summarily
abated by the town through boarding. The town may also post both the structure
and the exterior premises with signs to provide reasonable notice prohibiting
entry (i.e., “No Trespassing” signs). Any and all charges and costs arising
from the town taking action to secure the structure shall be a lien filed
against the real property containing such a structure.
   (D)   Emergency abatement.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter if, in the
opinion of the code official, the conditions at a property constitute an
imminent hazard, the code official may order immediate abatement of the hazard
without notice. Such abatement of an imminent hazard shall be limited to the
minimum work necessary to remove the hazard and may include disconnection of
utilities.
      (2)   The town shall pay the cost and expense of such abatement from any
appropriation made available for that purpose.
      (3)   A lien shall be recorded with the County Recorder’s office and
shall address the same costs and procedures identified in division (B) above.
      (4)   Whenever the code official finds that any structure contains an
imminent hazard or health hazard, the code official may declare such structure
unfit for human occupancy and order it to be vacated or to remain vacant. A
structure declared unfit for occupancy and ordered vacated or to remain vacant
under the provisions of this section shall not be leased, rented or occupied,
and the utilities cannot be reconnected, until it has been inspected and deemed
fit for occupancy by the town. The town shall reinspect, for the purpose of
reoccupancy, within three business days of the receipt of a written request by
the owner.
      (5)   Fire department suppression forces are responsible for emergency
operations related to fire conditions. In any case involving fire conditions at
a building or structure, fire suppression forces shall be responsible for fire
suppression and structure control until such time as the fire is fully
extinguished. After fire conditions are fully extinguished, and after any
necessary fire cause investigation, fire suppression forces shall transfer
control and responsibility for the building or structure to the Building
Official or other appropriate code official. After this transfer, all
subsequent enforcement actions, such as securing the structure, restoring
utilities or ordering demolition, as well as all follow up actions such as cost
recovery, shall be the responsibility of the Building Official or code
official. After the transfer of responsibility, fire cause investigators shall
retain authority over and responsibility for investigation of fire causation.
   (E)   Structures posted as hazardous.
      (1)   Whenever the code official has determined that a structure is unfit
for occupancy and orders the structure to be vacated, the code official shall
post a written notice at or upon each exit of the structure. The notice shall
be in substantially the following form:
 
DO NOT ENTER UNSAFE TO OCCUPY
It is unlawful to occupy this structure or to remove or deface this notice.
 
      (2)   No person shall remain in or enter any structure that has been so
posted, except to make repairs, demolish or remove such structure under permit.
No person shall remove or deface such notice after it is posted until the
required repairs, demolition or removal of the structure is completed and the
property is reinspected and found to be in compliance.
      (3)   Whenever a notice is posted pursuant to division (E)(2) above, the
code official shall provide notice of such posting to the property owner using
the procedures and provisions set forth in §
92.05(F) of this chapter. This notice shall recite the emergency and describe
the hazardous condition(s) that necessitate the posting.
   (F)   Abatement by demolition. Abatement by demolition shall be ordered only
where repair of the structure is unreasonable or impracticable, and demolition
and removal of a structure or building is necessary to correct and abate a
violation. Any action involving the demolition of a building or structure shall
be commenced by issuing a notice of violation to the owner and any responsible
parties in accordance with the provisions of §
92.05(F) of this chapter.
(Ord. 20-05, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 92.07 ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS.

provisions specified in §
92.05(E) of this chapter when there exists an unusual or unreasonable hardship
resulting from a literal interpretation of this chapter. The code official

application of this chapter impractical, and the variance is in conformity with
the intent and purpose of this chapter, and that the variance does not lessen
health, life safety and fire safety requirements or any degree of structural
integrity. The details of actions granting variances shall be recorded and
maintained by the code official.
   (D)   Appeals to the Council.
      (1)   An owner or responsible party who is not or was not a party to a

      (3)   In cases involving an order to vacate or suspend occupancy of a
group dwelling public nuisance, the property owner or a lawful tenant of the
property that is the subject of the order to vacate may appeal that order to
the Council on the grounds that the order to vacate is unreasonable or
arbitrary.
      (4)   The appellant shall prepare the appeal in a written application as

date of the service of such notice.
      (5)   Except for vacation orders made pursuant to §
92.06(D) and (E) of this chapter, the timely filing of an appeal shall act as
an automatic stay of enforcement of the notice of violation until the appeal is
finally determined by the Council. The filing of an appeal does not stay
enforcement of any notice or order, or any provision thereof, where the notice
or order includes an order to vacate.
      (6)   As soon as practicable after receiving the written appeal, the
Council shall fix a date, time and place for the hearing of the appeal. Such
date shall not be less than ten days, nor more than 60 days, from the date the
appeal was filed. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be
given at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing to each appellant by
the Town Clerk, either by causing a copy of the notice to be delivered
personally or by mailing a copy thereof, postage prepaid, addressed to the
appellant at the address shown on the appeal.
      (7)   Failure of any person to file an appeal in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall constitute a waiver of the right to an
administrative hearing of the appeal and adjudication of the notice of
violation, and such person shall be stopped to deny the validity of any order
or action of the town which could have been timely appealed.
      (8)   The Council shall decide any appeal immediately after the hearing,
or within a reasonable time thereafter, but in no event shall the Council keep
an appeal under consideration for more than five days after the hearing. The
Council shall render its decision in writing, and the decision of the Council
shall be filed with the Town Clerk, with a copy to the appellant or applicant.
The decision of the Council is final. No further appeal is available to town or
county boards or officials. In all other cases, persons aggrieved by decisions
of the Council may apply to Superior Court for relief in accordance with the
state’s Rules of Procedure for Special Actions. In the absence of a court
order, the filing of an appeal or special action will not stay enforcement.

to operate such a business, each individual having a 20% or greater interest in
the corporation must sign the application for a business license as an
applicant, in all cases, any person involved in the day-to-day operation of the
business or has the capacity to significantly influence the operation of the
business must sign the application as an applicant.

   (A)   Upon the filing of an application for a sexually-oriented business
employee license, the Town Clerk shall issue a temporary license to said

performing services on the sexually-oriented business premises so that said
license may be available for inspection upon lawful request. If application is
made for a sexually-oriented business license, the Town Clerk shall approve or
deny issuance of the license within 45 days of receipt of the completed

(Ord. 20-01, passed 1-14-2020)
§ 116.22 LICENSE ADMINISTRATION; ENFORCEMENT.
   Every license shall be subject to the following administrative and
enforcement provisions.
   (A)   The permission granted by a license is limited to the use areas, which
shall be identified in the system route map attached to an approved license.
New use areas may be approved upon application for a permit pursuant to
Ch. 152 of this code of ordinances for such new use areas. The applications
shall include specific information on the location of the new use areas and the
proposed facilities. Upon approval by the Town Engineer, the new use areas
shall be depicted on the system route map and shall be subject to all terms and
conditions of the license and lawful conditions, if any, imposed by the town.
   (B)   A licensee’s facilities shall meet the applicable standard
specifications and requirements of the town. The licensee’s use of the public
highway shall be according to plans approved by the Town Engineer; provided
that, such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Facilities
shall not be located above-ground unless there is no practical alternative and
any such facilities shall be earth-toned colors or screened to the extent
reasonably practical. The licensee’s installation of facilities shall be
coordinated with the town to accommodate opportunities for common installation.
Prior to the start of any construction work, the licensee shall notify all
affected residents or businesses at least 48 hours in advance of any street,
alley, sidewalk and driveway closures in order to allow them to make suitable
arrangements to have all vehicles moved to a satisfactory location outside the
closed area. If an emergency requires activity without such written notice, the
licensee shall use reasonable efforts to provide timely actual notice to the
owners or other persons having lawful control of the adjoining property. The
licensee shall identify a representative, such as a project manager, who shall
be the contact person for the town during any construction periods.
   (C)   A licensee shall maintain “as-built” drawings of its facilities
located within the public highway and furnish a copy electronically in a
mapping format compatible with the current town electronic mapping format and
in hard copy form. Upon completion of new or relocation construction of
underground facilities in the public highway, the licensee shall create and
maintain precise, up-to-date maps of any of its facilities and any above ground
equipment located in the public highway and precise and verifiable horizontal
and vertical location information and will make this information available to
the town upon the installation of any new facilities. A licensee will also
provide surface-location marking of the licensee’s facilities that are located
underground within any public highway within 30 business days of installation.
If complete updates are not provided in a compatible format, licensee shall pay
the actual, reasonable costs the town incurs to update the town’s electronic
mapping format due to the location or relocation of the licensee’s facilities.
In the event the licensee fails to supply records in the town specified format
and there is a cost to the town in converting licensee-provided files, the
licensee will be responsible for the conversion costs and will pay such costs
within 30 days of the date of the bill from the town invoicing the amount due.
   (D)   The authority granted by a license does not authorize the licensee’s
use of the facilities for the construction, installation or operation of
wireless facilities, a cable television system, a cable system or a video
services system or authorize the licensee to operate as a cable operator or
video services provider as those terms are defined in the Communications Act of
1934, being 47 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., state law or the town code. The authority
granted by a license does not authorize the use of the public highway for an
open video system as defined in the Communications Act of 1996, being 47 U.S.C.
§§ 571 et seq., or as defined or authorized by the federal communications
commission. The authority granted by a license is not in lieu of any other
license or franchise the town may require to occupy the public highways to
provide service other than as authorized under a license.
   (E)   A licensee shall comply with rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission and the state’s Corporation Commission that apply to
the services that licensee provides over the facilities in the public highway.
   (F)   In order for the town to determine a licensee’s compliance with the
terms of a license, within 30 days of a request for disclosure by the town, the
licensee shall provide the documentation requested by town. For purposes of
confirming that the licensee is providing solely services authorized under a
license, upon reasonable request and notice by the town, the licensee shall
make available for joint inspection and testing as requested by the town, the
current services being provided by licensee through the facilities authorized
by a license. If the licensee determines that in order to respond to the town’s
request for documentation and inspection that it must reasonably provide
proprietary information, the licensee shall so designate such claim to
proprietary treatment on documents provided to the town.
   (G)   If the facilities of a licensee or any other licensee equipment,
improvements or activities within the use areas present any immediate hazard or
impediment to the public, to the town, to other improvements or activities
within or without the use areas, or to the town’s ability to safely and
conveniently operate the public highway or perform the town’s utility, public
safety and other public health, safety and welfare functions, then licensee
shall immediately remedy the hazard, comply with the town’s requests to secure
the use areas, and otherwise cooperate with the town at no expense to town to
remove any such hazard or impediment. The licensee’s work crews shall report to
the use areas within four hours of any request by the town under this division
(G).
   (H)   If a licensee abandons use of its facilities, or upon cancellation,
revocation or termination of a license, the licensee shall notify the town and
may, subject to the town’s approval, permanently abandon the facilities in
place. In lieu of permanent abandonment, the town may require a licensee to the
reasonable satisfaction of the town and, without cost or expense to the town,
promptly to remove its facilities and to restore the public highway. If a
licensee fails or refused to remove the facilities required by town to be
removed, the town may do so and licensee shall pay the cost of such removal and
the restoration of the highway. Upon permanent abandonment, if the town does
not require removal, a licensee shall submit to the town a proposal and
instruments for transferring ownership to the city. Any facilities which are
not removed within 120 days of the town’s written request, automatically shall
become the property of the town. The Arizona Blue Stake Center must be notified
to record abandoned facilities.
   (I)   Any and all rights granted to a licensee shall be subject to the prior
and continuing right of the town to use the public highway, including the use
areas. Any and all rights granted to a licensee shall also be subject to all
deeds, easements, dedications, conditions, covenants, restrictions,
encumbrances and claims to title which may affect the public highway. A license
shall be construed to grant, convey, create or vest a perpetual real property
interest in land to a licensee.
   (J)   A licensee accepts the risk that there may now or in the future exist
in the use areas other work and improvements that the town may approve from
time to time. The town shall have full authority to regulate use of the use
areas and to resolve competing demands and preferences regarding use of the use
areas and to require a licensee to cooperate and participate in implementing
such resolutions.
   (K)   Neither the town nor any agent, contractor or employee of the town
shall be liable to a licensee, its customers or third parties with user
contracts for any service disruption or for any other harm caused them or the
facilities due to competing uses of the public highway.
   (L)   A licensee may enter into user contracts with unrelated third parties
in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business for use of portions of the
facilities of the licensee. All such third parties shall obtain a license from
the town pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-583(D). No person shall transmit data over the
facilities of the licensee or otherwise use the facilities, except under a user
contract with a licensee. The licensee shall provide to town:
      (1)   The name of the third party;
      (2)   The name, title, address, telephone number and email address of a
person with authority to speak for the third party;
      (3)   The route of the proposed service; and
      (4)   Any other information relevant to the use of the public highway by
the third party reasonably requested by the town.
   (M)   All signage is prohibited; except that, a licensee shall install and
thereafter maintain all signs and markings that the facilities and the
licensee’s activities may make necessary for safe use of the use areas by the
public, the town, the licensee and other persons who may be at the use areas at
any time for any reason.
   (N)   Licenses shall be personal to the licensee. Except as provided in the
license, no transfer of a license or licensee, or change of control over the
same (including, but not limited to, transfer by forced or voluntary sale,
merger, consolidation, receivership or any other means) shall occur unless
prior application is made to the town and the town’s prior written consent is
obtained, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In making
a determination as to whether to approve a transfer, the town may consider the
same information and qualifications required of an original application for a
license; whether the licensee is in compliance with its license and this
chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee’s commitment to cure such non-
compliance; whether the transfer would result in an evasion of other applicable
provisions of law, or impair lawful contracts; and the effect of the transfer
on the town’s interest. No application for a transfer of a license shall be
granted unless the proposed transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by
and accept all terms of the chapter and the license, and that it will assume
all obligations, liabilities and responsibility for all acts and omissions,
known and unknown, of the previous licensee under this chapter and the license
for all purposes, including renewal. Approval by the town of a transfer of a

regulatory and other powers as it now has or may later obtain, and a license
may not waive the application of the same.
   (P)   Every license shall be subject to revocation if the licensee fails to
comply with the material terms and conditions of the license, or applicable
law; provided, however, that, a license shall not be revoked unless the
licensee is given written notice of the defect in performance, and fails to
cure the performance within 60 days of the notice, except where the town finds
that the defect in performance is due to intentional misconduct, is a violation
of criminal law, or is part of a pattern of violations where the licensee has
already had notice and opportunity to cure. A hearing shall be held before a
license is revoked if the licensee requests a hearing.
   (Q)   (1)   Activities of a licensee and contractors of a licensee in the
public highway shall be subject to environmental laws, now or hereafter

machinery; and
         (b)   Electric backup batteries and other materials that may contain
hazardous substances that are commonly used in the provision of

violation.
   (R)   The town shall have the right, because of a public emergency, to
sever, disrupt, remove, tear out, dig up or otherwise damage and/or destroy
facilities of a licensee without any prior notice to licensee, if the action is
deemed necessary by the Town Manager. In such event, the town shall not be
liable to the licensee, its contractors or its customers or their parties for
any harm so caused to them or the facilities, except due to gross negligence or
willful misconduct of town. The town shall inform the licensee of any actions
taken. The licensee shall be responsible for repair at its sole expense of any
of its facilities damaged pursuant to any such action taken by the town.

limited by the recovery of any amounts pursuant to the insurance provisions of
the license or pursuant to any indemnity clause.

determine whether licensee has complied with its obligations under the license
or other applicable law.

charge to a telecommunications corporation for the use of a public highway to
provide telecommunications services, or levy a tax, fee or charge upon the
privilege of engaging in the business of providing telecommunications services;
except that, in connection with its provisions of telecommunications services
and its use of the highways to provide the same, each telecommunications
corporation shall:
      (1)   Pay a transaction privilege tax on the business of providing
telecommunications services or applicable use tax;
      (2)   Pay public highway construction permit fees and utility poles and
wires construction permit fees established from time to time by the town

public highways that carry interstate traffic between and among the
telecommunication corporation’s points of presence exclusive of facilities used
by the local network and the portion of the interstate network that carries

trench in the public highways. The rate per linear foot shall be set by Council
resolution and shall not exceed the highest rate per linear foot a political

provided to the town under the license shall remain in possession and ownership
of the town after the term of the license expires. The value of in-kind
benefits shall be less than or equal to, and may be offset against, payments of
interstate linear foot charges or transaction privilege tax on the business of
providing telecommunications service owed to the town, but shall not be offset
for any combination of intrastate and interstate charges.
   (B)   Disputes. If the licensee disputes the amount of town construction
permit fees or other fees payable under this chapter, the matter shall be
referred to a dispute resolution board. The board shall consist of three
members agreed upon by both parties. Expenses for the board shall be shared
equally by the town and the licensee. The board will hear the dispute promptly,

the board shall be admissible in any legal action. The town and the licensee
shall accept or reject findings of the board within 30 days after receipt of
the findings. If damages are assessed by the board, the licensee shall pay town
within 30 days of receipt of an invoice. Late charges of 5% and interest
charges of 1.5% per month shall be added for late payment.

Town Manager will provide the applicant with a written justification for the
denial with references to the applicable statutes, ordinances, codes or
substantive policy statements on which the denial is based. The notice of
denial will explain the applicant’s right to protest the denial to the Town
Council, that the applicant must specify the basis for its protest, including a
description for why it believes Town Council incorrectly denied the license,
and that the protest must be filed within 20 working days of the date of the
denial.

      (2)   If the same venue will be used multiple times for the same type of
special event, the applicant may request a blanket special event permit rather

      (3)   Prior to approval of a permit, if any sales at the event require a
transaction privilege tax license, the applicant shall obtain a transaction
privilege license for reporting and paying all taxes due under the tax code for
the person’s own activities. It shall be unlawful for any holder of a special
event permit to allow any vendor to conduct sales at the special event until

temporary facilities and activities, the plans required by §
118.03(A) through (G) of this chapter, and any other information required by §
118.03.

misleading statement, evasion, or suppression of a material fact;
         (b)   Another special event has been approved to occur on the same day
in the same area or traffic circulation would be impeded or public safety would
be compromised by having two or more special events in the same area;
         (c)   The application does not comply with this chapter and all other
applicable codes, ordinances, or other laws; and/or
         (d)   The proposed special event or short-term rental special event is

or short-term rental special event.

comply with all applicable federal, state, county and town ordinances,
statutes, and regulations.
      (10)   The special event shall not be advertised as a special event of
the town, nor shall the town be a sponsor of a special event, unless the Town
Council approves a contract for such sponsorship which sets forth the duties,
responsibilities, and participation of the town with respect to the special
event.
      (11)   The permit shall be displayed at the special event site or the
short-term rental special event site in a conspicuous location for the duration
of the special event.

owners and residents of the special event or short-term rental special event
prior to commencement of the special event due to its size or the activity
proposed.
   (B)   Permit fee.
      (1)   A non-refundable fee established by resolution of the Council shall
be required for each permit application, which fee shall be paid at the time of
submittal of the application.
      (2)   Except for vendors exempt pursuant to
Ch. 111 of this code of ordinances, vendors selling products at a special event
shall obtain a seasonal vendor business license permit pursuant to §
111.03 of this code and comply with all requirements of
Ch. 111.
   (C)   Special events on town property.
      (1)   In addition to a special event permit, if the special event will be
held on town property the applicant shall enter into a contract with the town

their original condition, including but not limited to removal of debris and
waste. The Town Manager may require a greater deposit if he determines that the
size or nature of the special event warrants a greater deposit.

submitted at the same time as the application for a special event permit. The
request shall be submitted at least 30 days prior to the scheduled start of the

permit fee for a special event solely sponsored and operated by, or in which
the entire proceeds accrue to, an entity which is exempt from federal income
taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. No such
waiver shall be granted where a for-profit entity is involved in organizing or
operating the special event.
   (E)   Appeal to Town Council. 
      (1)   If the Town Manager denies an application for a special event or
short-term rental special event, the applicant may appeal the decision to the

from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may
otherwise be obtained, he or she finds that:
         (a)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not
substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other pedestrian or
vehicular traffic contiguous to its route or location;
         (b)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not require
the diversion of so great a number of town police officers to properly police
the line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal
police protection of the town;

or public assembly points of the parade or public assembly will not unduly
interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to,
areas contiguous to such staging and public assembly areas;

time but not location is already granted or has been received and shall be
granted, and the police resources required for that prior parade or public
assembly are so great that in combination with the subsequent proposed
application, the resulting deployment of police services would have an
immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and
property; and
         (l)   No event is scheduled elsewhere in the town where the police
resources required for that event are so great that the deployment of police
services for the proposed parade or public assembly would have an immediate and
adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property.
      (2)   The Town Manager shall act promptly upon a timely filed application
for a parade or public assembly permit but in no event shall grant or deny a
permit less than five days prior to the event. If the Town Manager disapproves

(Ord. 21-04, passed 3-11-2021)
§ 152.04 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES IN PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   General. If the work to be performed in a public right-of-way involves
the installation, construction, erection, replacement or relocation of any
facilities, a permit shall be obtained from the Public Works Department. Such
permit shall be issued on such conditions as are reasonable and necessary to
ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of town standards. The
application shall include all information required in §
152.02 of this chapter. Each permittee is responsible for ensuring that its
facilities are installed, constructed and maintained in strict accordance with
town standards; that all required licenses, franchises and other permits are
applied for and obtained before any work commences; and that the terms and
conditions thereof are strictly followed. Where a facility is used by more than
one permittee, each permittee is fully responsible for ensuring that all
requirements are satisfied. Facilities shall be installed, constructed and
maintained so that no additional provision of this code, the Zoning Code or the
Subdivision Code, or the provisions of any license, permit, or franchise issued
by town shall be violated. This shall require, at a minimum, compliance with
the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Joint use of trenches. In order to minimize degradation of streets,
traffic impacts and other interference with the use of public right-of-ways,
work shall be coordinated so that to the greatest extent possible, consistent
with economic feasibility, joint trenching is utilized. The Public Works
Department shall adopt rules to facilitate joint trenching in the public right-
of-ways.
   (C)   Traffic safety. The facilities to be constructed, installed, operated,
and maintained by the permittee shall be so located or relocated as to
interfere as little as possible with traffic or other authorized uses over,
under, or through the right-of-way. Those phases of construction relating to
traffic-control, backfilling, compaction, and paving, as well as the location
or relocation of said facilities shall be subject to regulation by the Council.
   (D)   Records. The permittee shall keep accurate records of the location of
all facilities in the right-of-way and furnish them to the town upon request or
at such periodic intervals as the town may require. In order for the town to
regulate users in the right-of-way, upon completion of new or relocation
construction of underground facilities in the right-of-way, the permittee shall
provide the town with the location of the underground and aboveground
facilities in a format compatible with the current town mapping format.
   (E)   Landscaping. Landscaping, whether in the public rights-of-way or on
private property, which is damaged by a permittee shall be restored to its
condition as it existed prior to the work. A permittee shall exercise special
care when working near established trees or shrubs. If established trees or
shrubs die within six months of completion of work by a permittee, it is
presumed that the permittee caused such damage if the work performed was in the
location of the roots of such tree or shrub.
   (F)   Town’s facilities. The installation, use and maintenance of the
permittee’s facilities within the right-of-way authorized herein shall be in
such a manner as not to interfere with placement, construction, use, and
maintenance of public rights-of-way, street lighting, water pipes, drains,
sewers, traffic signal systems, or other utility systems that have been, or may
be, installed, maintained, used or authorized by the town. Upon the town’s
request, the permittee’s facilities will be relocated at permittee’s expense
(unless state law expressly requires otherwise). Upon the town’s request, by a
time specified by the town, if the permittee fails to move its facilities, the
town may do so and will bill the permittee the costs therefor and the permittee
shall pay those costs within 30 days after its receipt of the invoice therefor.
Further, the permittee shall reimburse the town any additional cost the town
incurs due to the location or relocation of the permittee’s facilities,
including all design and construction costs.
   (G)   Interference. The permittee shall not install, maintain, or use any of
its facilities in such a manner as to damage or interfere with facilities of
another located within the right-of-way.
   (H)   Location and maintenance of aboveground facilities. The location of
aboveground facilities, such as boxes, cabinets and similar equipment or
appurtenances, require the approval of the town prior to installation. The
permit shall set forth the location of such aboveground facilities. If the
Director determines that a proposed location would impair traffic visibility or
visibility of existing signage or would substantially harm existing
landscaping, or that similar conditions exist which would justify a denial of a
permit in that location, the permit shall be denied. Aboveground facilities
shall be maintained in good condition. If the town finds any of permittee’s
aboveground facilities are not maintained in good condition, permittee shall
correct such condition within three business days of receiving notice from the
town.
   (I)   Plans. All facilities shall be installed per plans prepared by a
registered professional engineer. All plans shall be approved by the town
before the work commences. A permittee may install facilities on existing
utility poles or in existing conduit where permission is granted by owner of
the utility pole or conduit, and such permission is verified by the town except
where those same poles are scheduled to be replaced with buried facilities. The
town may require the permittee to prove that it has such permission from the
owner to use the owner’s facilities. No new poles, or longer poles, will be
permitted in the public right-of-ways for any new facilities except where
otherwise required or permitted by law. If permittee installs facilities on
existing poles as provided herein, the permittee shall bury or remove its
facilities if such poles are removed and not replaced in kind for any reason.
If the permittee makes use of existing conduit of another person, the permittee
shall be subject to the provisions of this section in the use of such conduit
in the public right-of ways. As used herein, a pole installed to replace a
damaged pole or to remedy a safety hazard and which is substantially the same
size as the pole being replaced shall not be considered to be a new pole.
   (J)   Repairs. A permit shall be obtained from the Public Works Department
prior to a person removing, relocating, or reconstructing, if necessary, any
portion of a person’s facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town
understands and acknowledges there may be instances when a person is required
to make repairs, in compliance with federal or state laws, that are of an
emergency nature. The permittee will notify the town prior to such repairs, if
practicable, and will obtain the necessary permits in a reasonable time after
notification.
   (K)   Failure to complete work. If the permittee fails to complete the work
authorized by the permit within the time period set forth in the permit, or an
extended period of time as authorized by the Director, the town may draw on the
letter of credit to complete the work.
   (L)   Completion of work. Upon completion of work authorized by a permit,
the permittee shall request a final inspection. The permittee, at the
permittee’s expense shall:
      (1)   Restore the public and private improvements, including landscaping,
in the right-of-way;
      (2)   Restore natural features, including vegetation, in the right-of-
way;
      (3)   Remove any encroachments owned by permit holder (that are not
permitted); and
      (4)   Take other actions to return the right-of-way to its public uses.
   (M)   Stop work order. If the Director determines that work in the right-of-
way is being conducted in a manner that is contrary to the provisions of this
chapter or presents a public health or safety threat, the Director is
authorized to issue a written stop work order. The stop work order shall state
the reason for the order and the conditions under which it may resume. Upon
receipt, the permittee shall immediately cease work.
   (N)   Letter of acceptance. Upon acceptance, the Director shall issue a
letter of acceptance. The warranty period required by the mag standards begins
on the date the Director issues the letter of acceptance.
   (O)   Damaging of right-of-way. A permittee who damages right-of-way or
public improvements in the right-of-way shall reimburse the town the expense of
repairing the damage.
(Ord. 21-04, passed 3-11-2021)
§ 152.05 DAMAGE TO RIGHT-OF-WAY AND FACILITIES; PAVEMENT RESTORATION.
   (A)   A permit to work in the right-of-way which requires excavation of a
paved right-of-way shall comply with this section, in addition to other
requirements of this chapter. If the permittee damages or disturbs the surface
or subsurface of any rights-of-way or adjoining public property, or the public
improvement located thereon, therein, or thereunder, the permittee shall
promptly, at its own expense, and in a manner acceptable to the town, restore
the surface or subsurface of the right-of-way or public property, or repair or
replace the public improvement thereon, therein, or thereunder, in as good a
condition as before such damage or disturbance. If such restoration, repair or
replacement of the surface, subsurface, or any structure located thereon,
therein, or thereunder is not completed within a reasonable time, or such
repair or replacement does not meet town standards, the town shall have the
right to perform the necessary restoration, repair, or replacement, either
through its own forces, or through a hired contractor, and the occupant agrees
to reimburse the town for its expense in so doing within 30 days after receipt
of the invoice therefor.
   (B)   As used in this section:
      (1)   A paved right-of-way is considered “new” when it is first
constructed, when it is reconstructed or when it is renovated;
      (2)   A right-of-way is considered “reconstructed” when all lanes are
completely rebuilt by removing all the pavement and aggregate base course
material, re-compacting the sub-base and restoring the base material and then
completely repaving for a distance approved by the Director;
      (3)   A right-of-way is considered “renovated” when there is a major
rehabilitation, including a mill and overlay or other similar improvement work
that physically modifies the surface of the right-of-way prior to applying a
new surface or other similar work as determined by the Director; and
      (4)   The date of construction, reconstruction or renovation shall be the
date such work was accepted by the town.
   (C)   An application to work in the right-of-way which includes excavation
in a new paved right-of-way shall not be granted until at least two years after
completion and acceptance of the construction, reconstruction or renovation of
the paved right-of-way unless one of the following applies:
      (1)   Emergency which endangers life or property;
      (2)   Interruption of essential utility or communications service;
      (3)   Work that is mandated by town, county, state or federal
legislation; or
      (4)   Service for buildings where no other feasible means of providing
service exists.
   (D)   (1)   If an excavation is permitted pursuant to divisions (C)(1)
through (C)(4) above, the permittee shall restore the paved right-of-way by
mill and overlay/inlay, for a minimum of the full width of all lanes impacted
by the excavation(s) (outside lane includes to the curb). For arterial streets,
this shall require extending the restoration a minimum length of 50 feet both
directions from the area of the excavation(s) and, for collector streets, this
shall mean extending the restoration a minimum length of 25 feet both
directions from the area of the excavation(s), all as more specifically
directed by the Director. For excavations smaller than two square feet, the
requirement to restore by mill and overlay/inlay shall not apply. All
renovations shall comply with the town’s standard details and specifications.
The permittee may elect to fully reconstruct the paved right-of-way in
accordance with specifications provided by the Director in lieu of paying the
pavement restoration fee.
      (2)   For excavation commencing two years or later after the paved right-
of-way is new (as defined in division (B)(1) above) but before seven years
after a paved right-of-way is new (as defined in division (B) above), the
permittee may elect to renovate such paved right-of-way by mill and overlay/
inlay for a minimum of the full width of all lanes impacted by the excavation
(s) (outside lane includes to the curb) and for arterial streets extending a
minimum length of 50 feet both directions from the area of the excavation(s)
and for collector streets extending a minimum length of 25 feet both directions
from the area of the excavation(s), all as more specifically directed by the
Director, in lieu of payment of the pavement restoration fee.
   (E)   (1)   In addition to the other requirements of this section, a
permittee shall pay a pavement restoration fee established by resolution of the
Council. The pavement restoration fee shall be reviewed annually with the
budget for street repair.
      (2)   The pavement restoration fee shall be paid prior to or at the time
a permit to work in the public right-of-way is issued. In the event the
pavement restoration fee is amended after a permit to work in the public right-
of-way is issued, an adjusted fee shall be paid as follows:
         (a)   If the original permit was for one square yard through 20 square
yards, the pavement restoration fee shall be adjusted pursuant to the new fee
schedule if the increase/decrease to the pavement excavation is one square yard
or larger;
         (b)   If the original permit was for 21 square yards through 100
square yards, the pavement restoration fee shall be adjusted pursuant to the
new fee schedule if the increase/decrease to the pavement excavation is more
than 5% of the original;
         (c)   If the original permit was for more than 100 square yards, the
pavement restoration fee shall be adjusted pursuant to the new fee schedule if
the increase/decrease to the pavement excavation is more than five square
yards; or
         (d)   Such amended pavement restoration fee shall be applied for and
any additional fees shall be paid within one week of the field change or prior
to any new permit issued to permittee.
(Ord. 21-04, passed 3-11-2021)
§ 152.06 BOND.
   (A)   Each applicant with a project that the Director determines has a cost
of work of $25,000 or more must deposit with the town an amount in cash or a
performance bond of 100% of the amount of the cost of work proposed in the
application, as determined by the Director, as a guarantee that the work will
be completed in accordance with the permit and the town’s adopted or approved
details and specifications. If the applications solely for the placement of a
structure in the right-of-way which will require disturbance of the roadway or
other public facilities, the amount of the cash deposit or bond shall be 100%
of the estimated cost of restoration of the roadway or public facility.
   (B)   The bond required under division (A) above shall be joint and several
in form and made payable to the town. The bond shall be signed by the
applicant, or the property owner if he or she is not the applicant, and a
qualified surety company authorized to transact business in the state. The
condition shall be that the applicant will faithfully complete the work
described in the application in accordance with the plans, specifications and
conditions thereof.
   (C)   The bond required under division (A) above shall be released upon
satisfactory completion and acceptance of the work, or may be cancelled after
the applicant has provided other security satisfactory to the town, which will
cover obligations that remain.
   (D)   No deposit shall be less that $50 on work done under this subchapter.
   (E)   The bond required under division (A) above is subject to cancellation
as noted above, or may be terminated after all obligations are fulfilled which
were “permitted” prior to the Director receiving cancellation notice from the
surety. The surety shall not cancel, change or amend any bond without ten days’
prior written notice having been served on the Director.
(Prior Code, § 19-1-3) (Ord. 01-11, passed - -2001; Ord. 21-04, passed 5-11-
2021)
§ 152.07 INSURANCE.
   (A)   No applicant with a project that the Director determines has a cost of
work of $25,000 or more shall be entitled to a permit unless and until he or
she shall have filed and maintained on file with the town a certificate
certifying that he or she or his or her company or business firm carries public
liability and property damage insurance issued by an insurance carrier
authorized to do business in the state insuring the applicant and the town and
its agents against loss by reason of injuries to, or death of, persons or
damages to property arising out of or related to work performed by the
applicant, its agents or its employees while performing any work under such
permit. Such insurance shall be primary and provide coverage for all liability
assumed by the applicant under this section, and shall be provided by any
permittee in the following minimum amounts:
      (1)   Five hundred thousand dollars for death of, or injury to, any one
person in any one accident;
      (2)   One million dollars for death of, or injuries to, more than one
person in any one accident; and
      (3)   Five hundred thousand for damages to property.
   (B)   Failure by the applicant to provide the town with such a certificate
as required under division (A) above, and failure by the town to demand the
filing by the permittee of such a certificate before such a permit is issued,
shall not be deemed to waive the permittee’s obligation to provide the
insurance specified herein. Such insurance certificate shall remain in effect
and be kept on file with the Director until all work to be performed by the
permittee under the permit has been completed. Where an encroachment involves a
permanent obstruction, such insurance certificate requirements and other
resolution stipulations shall remain in effect until such construction is
removed. The insurance certificate shall provide that coverage cannot be
cancelled or expire without providing 15 days’ written notice of such action to
the town also noting the permit number.
   (C)   No evidence of liability insurance or surety bond shall be required as
condition precedent to the issuance of a permit to a federal, state, county or
political subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 19-1-4) (Ord. 01-11, passed - -2001; Ord. 21-04, passed 5-11-

§ 152.08 LIABILITY.
   (A)   The permittee shall be responsible for all liability imposed by law
for personal injury or property damage arising out of or related to work
performed by the permittee under the permit, or arising out of the failure on

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   In A.R.S. § 48-3610, the state legislature enabled the town to assume the
powers and duties for floodplain management and adopt regulations in
conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3609 designed to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the town does ordain as
follows.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage, also contribute to flood loss.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in special flood hazard areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize blight areas caused
by flooding;
   (G)   Notify potential buyers that the property is in a special flood hazard
area;
   (H)   Notify those who occupy special flood hazard areas that they assume
responsibility for their actions; and
   (I)   Participate in and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and
disaster relief.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)

abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in this definition.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map of a community, on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

elevation.
   FLOOD-RELATED EROSION. The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of
a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a

153.33 of this chapter, meaning the exceptional hardship that would result from
a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town Council requires that the
variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere
economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience,
aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the
disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an
exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means
without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or
requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different
use than originally intended.

the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the
basement. See BASEMENT. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other
than a basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided
that, such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of
the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”.

projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   PERSON. An individual or the individual’s agent, a firm, partnership,
association or corporation, or an agent of the aforementioned groups, or this

duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION (RFE). An elevation one foot above the base flood
elevation.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook and the like.
   SHEET FLOW AREA. See AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). An area in the floodplain subject to a 1%
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a Flood
Insurance Rate Map as Zone A, AO, AE, AH or A99.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued; provided,
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of
the permit. The actual START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground;
this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement to a structure, the total cost of which equals or exceeds 50%
of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided that, the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction or other uses of property in a manner that would otherwise
be prohibited by this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in
VIOLATION until such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height in relation to the National Geodetic

terrain); average depths determined. For areas of alluvial fan flooding,
velocities also determined.
   ZONE AR. Special flood hazard area formerly protected from the 1% annual
chance flood by a flood control system that was subsequently decertified. ZONE
AR indicates that the former flood control system is being restored to provide
protection from the 1% annual chance or greater flood.
   ZONE A99. Area to be protected from 1 % annual chance flood by a federal
flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations
determined.
   ZONE D. Areas in which flood hazards are undetermined, but possible.
   ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 0.2% annual chance flood; areas of 1% annual
chance flood with average depths of less than one foot or with drainage areas
less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from 1% annual chance
flood.

§ 153.06 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the
corporate limits of the town.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood
Insurance Study for La Paz County and incorporated areas, (FIS) dated August
28, 2008”, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated 8-28-2008,
and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference
and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is
the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which
are recommended to the Floodplain Board by the Floodplain Administrator. The
Floodplain Board, within its area of jurisdiction, shall delineate (or may, by
rule, require developers of land to delineate) for areas where development is
ongoing or imminent, and thereafter as development becomes imminent,
floodplains consistent with the criteria developed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the Director of the state’s Department of Water
Resources. The FIS and FIRM panels are on file at 465 N. Plymouth Avenue,
Quartzsite, AZ.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.08 COMPLIANCE.
   All development of land, construction of residential, commercial or
industrial structures, or future development within delineated floodplain areas
is subject to the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

§ 153.11 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall hot
create liability on the part of the town any officer or employee thereof, the
state or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 153.30 FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   The Town Manager is hereby appointed to administer, implement and
enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance
with its provisions.
   (B)   Duties of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be
limited to:
      (1)   Permit review.
         (a)   Review all development permits to determine that:
            1.   The permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
            2.   All other required state and federal permits have been
obtained;
            3.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and
            4.   In areas where a floodway has not been designated, the
proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas
where base flood elevations have been determined, but a floodway has not been
designated.
         (b)   For the purposes of this chapter, ADVERSELY AFFECT means that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Substantial improvement and substantial damage assessments. Review
all development permits for improvements and/or damages to existing structures
to determine if the application of the substantia] improvement rules apply,
including establishing a definition of market value determination and verifying
that the estimated improvement and/or repair costs are less than 50% of the
market value of the structure;
      (3)   Use of other base flood data. When Base Flood Elevation data has
not been provided in accordance with §
153.07 of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data available from a federal,
state or other source, in order to administer §§
153.45 through
153.51 of this chapter. Any such information shall be consistent with the
requirements of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Director of the
state’s Department of Water Resources and may be submitted to the Floodplain
Board for adoption;
      (4)   Obtain and maintain for public inspection. Obtain and maintain the
following for public inspection and make available as needed:
         (a)   Certification required by §§
153.45(C)(1) and
153.49 of this chapter (lowest floor elevations, bottom of the structural frame
and utilities);
         (b)   Certification required by §
153.45(C)(2) of this chapter (lowest floor elevations or flood-proofing of non-
residential structures and utilities;
         (c)   Certification required by §
153.45(C)(5) of this chapter (flood vents);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
153.48(A)(2) of this chapter (subdivisions and other proposed development
standards);
         (e)   Certification required by §
153.51 of this chapter (floodway encroachments);
         (f)   Records of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance; and
         (g)   Obtain and maintain improvement and damage calculations required
in division (B)(2) above.
      (5)   Notification to other entities.
         (a)   Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated:
            1.   Notify adjacent communities and the state’s Department of
Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and
submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
through appropriate notification means; and
            2.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse be maintained.
         (b)   Base flood elevation and rate of flow due to physical
alterations:
            1.   Base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from
physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not
later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with 44
C.F.R. § 65.3. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of
those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.
            2.   Within 120 days after completion of construction of any flood-
control protective works which changes the rate of flow during the base flood
or the configuration of the floodplain upstream or downstream from or adjacent
to the project, the person or agency responsible for installation of the
project shall provide to the governing bodies of all jurisdictions affected by
the project a new delineation of all floodplains affected by the project The
new delineation shall be done according to the criteria adopted by the Director
of the state’s Department of Water Resources.
         (c)   Corporate boundary changes. Notify the Federal Emergency
Management Agency of acquisition by means of annexation, incorporation or
otherwise, of additional areas of jurisdiction.
      (6)   Map determinations. Make interpretations, where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas (e.g., where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §§
153.33 and
153.34 of this chapter.
      (7)   Remedial actions. Take actions on violations of this chapter as
required in §
153.15 of this chapter.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.31 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   A development permit shall be obtained before construction or
development begins, including placement of manufactured homes, within any
special flood hazard area established in §
153.07 of this chapter. Application for a development permit shall be made on
forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be
limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions and elevation of the area in question, existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of
the foregoing.
   (B)   Specifically, the following information is required:
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest
floor (including basement) of all structures. In Zone AO, elevation of existing
highest adjacent grade and proposed elevation of lowest floor of all
structures;
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer, architect or
depending on type of project requirements and approval from the Administrator a

non-residential structure meet the flood-proofing criteria in §
153.45(C)(2) of this chapter;
      (4)   Base flood elevation data for subdivision proposals or other
development greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser; and
      (5)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.32 CRITICAL FACILITIES PLANNING.
   (A)   In an effort to provide for critical facilities planning (CFP), the
town has identified the necessity to develop a list of critical facilities that
are critical to the flood response if and when the need arises. A critical
facility is a structure or site that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety. Providing these identified facilities
with preparedness and early warning are essential for public safety during
emergency situations.
   (B)   The identified critical facilities are as follows:
      (1)   Town police station;
      (2)   Town fire stations;
      (3)   The town hospital and medical center; and
      (4)   The town water and wastewater treatment and distribution
facilities.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.33 VARIANCES; CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the Town Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious
that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued:
         (a)   Upon a determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
         (b)   For the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures
listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of
Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structures’ continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure;
         (c)   Upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
         (d)   Upon a showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (e)   Upon a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (f)   Upon a showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes
only facilities defined in §
153.05 of this chapter in the definition of “functionally dependent use”.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any floodway if any increase
in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the regulatory flood elevation; provided, the procedures of §§
153.30 through
153.32 and
153.45 through
153.51 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
§ 153.34 FLOODPLAIN REVIEW BOARD.
   (A)   The Town Council may establish a board of review, which may be the
advisory board or a committee of the advisory board to sit in review and make
decisions.
   (B)   The Floodplain Review Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
   (C)   In considering such applications, the Floodplain Review Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community:
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use,
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (C) above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Floodplain Review Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
regulatory flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the regulatory flood elevation increases
risks to life and property; and
      (3)   The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for
exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange
program provided by A.R.S. § 37-610. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in
the office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it
appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of ail variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (G)   A person aggrieved in any manner by an action of the Floodplain Review
Board may within 30 days appeal to the Floodplain Board.
(Ord. 18-09, passed 7-24-2018)
FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 153.45 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas, the following standards are required.
   (A)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored

of the process and the necessary actions to be taken with each stage.
(Ord. 21-11, passed 10-26-2021)
§ 154.031 STAGE 1 - PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   The pre-application conference stage of the subdivision process is an
investigatory period that affords the subdivider the opportunity to present
their development intentions and obtain preliminary advice and assistance from
the appropriate town departments prior to the expense of preparing a
preliminary plat. It also affords the town the opportunity to conduct a cursory
review of the proposed subdivision and give preliminary guidance at a time when
potential land development points of conflict can be most easily resolved,
subsequent relations improved, official action simplified, and undue expense
and delay saved by the subdivider.
   (A)   In carrying out the pre-application stage, the subdivider and the
department shall be responsible for the following actions:
      (1)   Actions by the subdivider. The subdivider shall request a pre-
application conference by submitting a completed pre-application form to the
Community Development Department. Applicants shall submit their completed pre-
application form at least 14 days prior to the desired pre-application meeting
date. In addition to the pre-application form, the subdivider shall provide a
general outline of his proposal, including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, street and lot
arrangement, tentative lot sizes;
         (b)   Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal,
surface drainage and street improvements.
      (2)   Actions by the Department. Prior to the scheduled pre-application
meeting the Department will review the submitted preliminary application
material and, depending upon the scope of the proposed development, will
proceed with the following investigations:
         (a)   Check existing zoning of the tract and make recommendations if a
zoning change is necessary or desirable;
         (b)   Determine the adequacy of existing proposed schools, parks and
other public spaces;
         (c)   Inspect the site or otherwise determine its relationship to
major streets, transit services, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, utility
systems, and adjacent land uses and to determine any unusual problems, such as
topography, utilities, flooding, etc.
   (B)   During the pre-application conference the Department will then discuss
the proposal with the subdivider; provide advice on procedural steps, design
and improvement standards, general plat requirements; and discuss tentative
timetables for the project.

federal, state, and/or local law, ordinance, code, rule, regulation, policy
and/or guideline; to protect the public from potential adverse impacts from the
proposed development; or to fulfill an identified need for public services.
      (3)   When in the opinion of the Council the location of the proposed
subdivision is such that a significant impact may develop between future
residents of the subdivision and existing land uses in the vicinity,
appropriate special easements dedicated to adjacent property owners may be

may provide for the continued occasional generation of smoke, odors, noise,
dust and spraying of pesticides as necessary.
      (4)   The action of the Town Council shall be communicated in writing to
the subdivider. Conditions of approval or disapproval shall be noted in the
Council meeting minutes and in a written correspondence provided to the
subdivider.
   (D)   Significance of preliminary approval. Preliminary plat approval
constitutes authorization for the subdivider to submit the final plat and the
improvement plans and specifications for the proposed project. Preliminary
approval is based on the following terms:
      (1)   The basic conditions under which preliminary approval of the
preliminary plat is granted will not be substantially changed prior to the
expiration date.
      (2)   After approval of the preliminary plat by the Council, the
subdivider shall, within one year, cause a final plat of the subdivision or any
part thereof to be prepared in accordance with a complete survey of the
subdivision and in compliance with the approved preliminary plat within the
provisions of this chapter.
         (a)   Upon application by the subdivider, the Council may grant an
extension for submission of the final plat of one year. In the event the
Council denies a subdivider’s application for extension, the decision shall be
final.

the recording of a final plat tract map shall be made in writing to the Council
not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the time allowed.
      (3)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of
approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the
preparation of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of the Town
Council upon fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and the
conditions of the conditional approval.
   (E)   Appeals.
      (1)   The decision of the Council to approve, approve with conditions or
deny the preliminary plat shall be final.
      (2)   Whenever standards of subdivision design or subdivision improvement
standards are requested to be modified or altered, application shall be made in
writing on a form provided by the Community Development Department, stating
fully the reasons for the application and the facts relied upon by the
subdivider. The Town Council may, after receiving a recommendation from the
Community Development Director and Public Works Director, allow a modification
from the subdivision regulations, provided facts are presented to the
satisfaction of the Council, that the modifications will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity.
   (F)   Preliminary plat required re-subdivision. A preliminary plat showing
data and information required by this section shall be required when the re-
subdivision of a lot, lots, tracts, or parcels previously recorded as a
subdivision or portion of a subdivision results in three or more additional
lots, tracts or parcels.
   (G)   Re-filing following disapproval. In the event that a preliminary plat
is disapproved by the Council, a new preliminary plat of the same area or
portion thereof may only be filed, within six months of the date of
disapproval, if the re-submittal is not in substantial conformance to the
original application. The applicant shall be required to submit a new
preliminary plat application, including fees and shall adhere to the same
review process.

STANDARDS OF SUBDIVISION DESIGN
§ 154.065 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of subdivision regulation is to create functional, attractive
developments, minimize adverse impacts on the community, and to ensure that
future subdivisions will conform to the community's expectations. To
accommodate this purpose, all subdivision plats shall conform to the following
standards, which are designed to result in a well-planned community without
adding unnecessarily to development costs.
(Ord. 21-11, passed 10-26-2021)
§ 154.066 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   All subdivisions shall conform to the following standards of
subdivision design, except in those cases where the Town Council has determined
that a modification is justified due to unusual topographical conditions or
other exceptional conditions. The layout and design of any, subdivision shall
be in conformance with the provisions of the General Plan, the Zoning Ordinance
and this Subdivision Ordinance.
   (B)   Land which is subject to periodic flooding, or land which cannot be
properly drained or other land which, in the opinion of the Commission is
unsuitable for the proposed use shall not be subdivided; however, the
Commission may approve subdivisions of such land upon receipt of evidence from
the County Health Department and the Town Public Works Director that the
construction of specific improvements can be expected to render the land
usable, in which event construction, upon such land shall be prohibited until
the specified improvements have been planned and construction guaranteed.
   (C)   Where the area proposed for development contains all or part of a
park, a school, flood control facility, or other public site, as shown on the
General Plan or as recommended by the Town Council, such site shall be reserved
for acquisition by the appropriate agency within a specific period of time as
prescribed in A.R.S. § 9-463.01(D) and (E). An agreement should be reached
between the subdivider and the appropriate public agency regarding time,
method, and cost of such acquisition. Dedication of such sites by the developer
may be considered by the town.
   (D)   Every subdivision shall conform to the goals, objectives, and policies
of the General Plan, the Zoning Code, Subdivision Ordinance, other ordinances
and regulations of the town, and the Arizona Revised Statutes. In the event two
or more requirements conflict, the most restrictive requirement shall apply.

lot, plot or parcel of land within the town limits of the Town of Quartzsite to
provide storage of sufficient volume to hold the total runoff from the design
storm falling on that lot, plot or parcel of land. An exception to this
requirement will be granted by the Public Works Director only when runoff can
be directed into a storm sewer, channel or natural drainage-way with sufficient
capacity to transport storm water to an approved ultimate disposal site. The
owner/developer shall not be required to provide storage for runoff from land
other than his or her own except where it can be proven that flow from adjacent
land has historically crossed or inundated the land of the owner/developer.

   (C)   Combination storage.
(Ord. 21-11, passed 10-26-2021)
§ 154.103 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR HANDLING WATER.
   (A)   When a retention basin is utilized to handle storm water runoff in a
commercial or residential subdivision, the following design standards shall be
applicable:
      (1)   The minimum storage volume shall be computed by estimating the area
under a hydrograph of a 100-year storm of two hours duration (1.22 inches per
hour). In addition, the greater of one foot of freeboard or 25% additional
basin capacity shall be provided in the facility.
      (2)   Maximum basin depth shall not exceed 3.5 feet unless otherwise
approved by the Public Works Director. If a basin is approved to exceed the
maximum depth, the facility shall be enclosed with a six foot high masonry
block fence and a 12 foot wide gate with lock.
      (3)   Maximum side slope shall be 4:1 unless otherwise approved by the
Public Works Director.
      (4)   An acceptable method of transporting water from the street into the
basin shall be provided so as to preserve the integrity of the basin walls and
floor.
      (5)   All residential streets shall be designed to carry the runoff from
a ten-year, two hour storm between the curbs. In cases where peak flows from
the design storm exceed the street capacity, storm sewers of sufficient size to
carry the excess must be installed. The minimum pipe size for underground storm
drainage shall be 12 inches. The peak flow from a 50-year storm must be carried
within the cross-section between buildings (front yards and streets) for
subdivisions served by retention basins. The floor elevations of all habitable
space shall be above flood levels equivalent to a 100-year storm.
      (6)   All streets with curb shall have a minimum longitudinal slope as
shown in the table below, designed in accordance with the Public Works Director
approval.
   Table 3: Street Slope
 
Minimum Slope
Straight (400 feet radius and over) curb 0.20%
Curved (less than 400 feet radius) curb  0.25%
Valley gutter flow-line                  0.30%
 
      (7)   Construction of the retention basin should follow the La Paz County
Public Works Design and Construction Manual.
      (8)   Each retention basin shall be constructed so that storm water will
not stand longer than five days after termination of the storm. Basin drainage
shall be accomplished by infiltration or by controlled flow into an existing
facility suitable to receive, transport and dispose of storm water. When
controlled flow is proposed, the owner/developer and the town shall obtain
approval from the owner of the existing facility, prior to formulating final
drainage for the retention basin. Final drainage plans shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Public Works Director.
      (9)   Subdivisions with more than one retention basin should interconnect
all basins.
      (10)   The owner/developer shall maintain the portion of drainage
improvements that fall within their subdivision following the La Paz County

streets) and the geometrics of the basin shall be coordinated with the Public
Works Director.
      (3)   With the approval of the Public Works Director, a retention basin
may be located on other streets, which allow a direct storm sewer route to an
arterial street. Additionally properly designed and sized inlets, manholes,
storm sewer lines and all other appurtenances shall be constructed to a point
where the storm sewer may be connected to a future storm main on an arterial
street.
