   A.   Street Naming in New Subdivisions: the process for initially assigning
street names to streets in new subdivisions is set forth in Section
14-03-080 of
Chapter 14 "SUBDIVISIONS" of this Code (as amended from time to time).
   B.   Other Street Naming: the method for initially assigning street names to
streets established, extended or realigned by a process other than a
subdivision plat process shall be -
      1.   by reversionary plat, approved by vote of the Town Council and
recorded in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder, showing the prior street
and street name as well as the new street configuration and street name;
      2.   by plat of dedication, accepted by vote of the Town Council and
recorded in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder, showing the new street
configuration and street name; or
      3.   by resolution of the Town Council, recorded in the Office of the
Yavapai County Recorder, generally showing the new street configuration and
street name.
      Except in cases of street extensions or realignments where an established
street name is continuing to be used, a street name will only be assigned after
the same has been reviewed and approved by the Building Department for
compliance with the street name standards set forth hereinafter.
(Ord. No. 350, Enacted, 02/09/95)
1-11-040   Street Name Standards.
   A.   Selection of Names:
      1.   Street names should generally be pleasant sounding, appropriate for
the community, and easily read and pronounced (for emergency purposes, taking
into account possible involvement of children).
      2.   Street names in Prescott Valley should be unique when compared to
other names within the telephone prefix areas which serve Prescott Valley (or
within any other areas required for efficient "911" or other emergency
communication service within the Town). Street names are generally not
considered unique (a) where the names themselves are the same, even though the
suffix designations differ, or (b) where the names are pronounced the same or
have a similar sound, even though spellings differ.
   B.   Selection of Suffix Designations:
      1.   Suffix designations for highways, major streets, or arterials shall
generally be -
         a.   Avenue (Av)
         b.   Boulevard (Bl)
         c.   Highway (Hw)
         d.   Parkway (Pw); or
         e.   Road (Rd).
      2.   Suffix designations for collectors, local streets, or frontage roads
shall generally be:
         a.   Drive (Dr)
         b.   Lane (Ln)
         c.   Loop (Lp)
         d.   Road (Rd)
         e.   Street (St); or
         f.   Trail (Tr).
      3.   Suffix designations for shorter streets or unique streets shall
generally be:
      a.   Circle (Cr)
         b.   Court (Ct)
         c.   Cove (Cv)
         d.   Pass (Pa)
         e.   Path (Pt)
         f.   Place (Pl)
         g.   Plaza (Pz)
         h.   Terrace (Te); or
         i.   Way (Wy).
   C.   Length of Street Names: Street names (including suffix designations)
shall be limited to spacing consistent with a 42-inch street sign (typically
15-17 letters plus suffix designation).
   D.   Special Circumstances:
      1.   "Cul-de-sacs" shorter than two hundred (200) feet and providing
access to five (5) or fewer lots should generally not be named but should
assume the name of the intersecting through-street. However, where there are a
series of cul-de-sacs off of the same through-street, all should generally be
assigned separate street names.
      2.   "Cul-de-sacs" may be assigned the same name as the intersecting
through-street (with a different suffix designation), without being considered
a name duplication for purposes of Subparagraph
1-11-040(A)(2) above.
      3.   Diagonal streets or streets which change direction or loop back onto
themselves (or other streets) should be given one (1) directional prefix based
on such streets' overall orientation in context with surrounding streets. [Note
that streets would change directional prefixes only where they cross a baseline
of the Grid Street Addressing System. Thus, highways, major streets or
arterials which change direction for a significant distance would still change
directional prefixes only where they cross an "0" point in the Grid Street
Addressing System.]
      4.   Streets located on the same alignment in the same geographical
region should bear the same street name and directional prefix (even though not
connected).
      5.   The naming of private access ways may be done solely in the interest
of public safety. However, such naming does not obligate the Town in any way to
install or maintain signs therefore or to maintain such streets. The Town
expressly does not accept any liability related to the existence, location or
condition of such signs or the design or condition of such streets.
(Ord. No. 350, Enacted, 02/09/95)
1-11-050   Street Signs.
   A.   Street signs conforming to the standards set forth hereinafter shall be
installed at the intersection of all streets (and at such other locations as
may be determined to be necessary from time to time by the Town Engineer or
his/her designee).
   B.   All street signs shall conform to the following standards at
installation:
   1.   The horizontal sign length shall not exceed forty-two (42) inches.
      2.   Signs shall be extruded aluminum, six (6) inches in vertical width,
with a .090 web thickness and a .250 flange thickness.
      3.   Sign letters shall be a minimum of four (4) inches high for names
and two (2) inches high for suffix designations (and directional prefixes if
used), and shall be reflectorized.
      4.   The sign legend and background shall be of contrasting colors,
namely a white message on a green background [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD)].
      5.   Sign letters shall be either heat activated 3M*2290 (or equivalent),
or pressure activated 3M*3290 (or equivalent). Normally a type "C" letter
should be used, but a type "B" letter may be used if necessary to fit the name
on the sign.
      6.   Sign backing material shall be engineer's grade 3M*2277 (or
equivalent).
   B.   Street signs installed by non-Town personnel shall first be approved by
the Town Engineer or his/her designee for conformance with these standards. The
Engineer or his/her designee may authorize placement of street name signs on
top of other traffic control signs.
(Ord. No. 350, Enacted, 02/09/95)
1-11-060   Street Name Changes.
   A.   Once established, street names may only be changed through one (1) of
the following methods:
      1.   Reversionary plat, approved by vote of the Town Council and recorded
in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder, showing the prior street name and
the new street name; or
      2.   Resolution of the Town Council, recorded in the Office of the
Yavapai County Recorder, showing the prior street name and the new street name.
   B.   Street name changes may be initiated in any of the following ways:
      1.   By any person (including Town staff on behalf of the Town), as part
of a reversionary plat application;
      2.   By Town staff requesting a Resolution of the Town Council; or
      3.   By any person filing a petition with the Building Department
requesting action by Resolution of the Council, and paying a fee specified in
the Comprehensive Fee Schedule. Said petition shall include the following:
         a.   A legal description of the street or portion thereof proposed for
street name change (including a map thereof).
         b.   The prior street name and the proposed new street name.
         c.   A narrative explanation of the reasons for changing the street
name (e.g. elimination of duplication, improvement of emergency services,
enhancement of neighborhood values, etc.).
         d.   Signatures of more than fifty percent (50%) of the persons owning
real property immediately adjacent to the portion of street proposed for name
change (said signatures complying with the standards and procedures established
by case law and statute for the collection of signatures on annexation
petitions pursuant to ARS § 9-471).
         e.   A certified list of the names and addresses of the persons owning
immediately adjacent real property, as well as the current addresses of
emergency services organizations that generally respond to those properties
(i.e. police, ambulance, and fire organizations).
   C.   Street name changes that are not pursued through a reversionary plat
process require a public hearing before the Town Council (after due notice).
Notice shall normally include mailing the date, time, location, and subject of
the hearing by first-class mail (postage prepaid) to (1) the listed persons
owning real property immediately adjacent to the portion of street proposed for
name change, (2) the listed emergency services organizations, and (3) the U.S.
Postal Service (local office), at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to
the public hearing date. In addition, notice shall normally include publishing
the same information once in the Daily Courier and posting the information at
each end of the portion of street proposed for name change (and at any
intersections in between), at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the public
hearing date.
   D.   Protests to a proposed street name change submitted in writing to the
Town Clerk at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to any public hearing thereon
shall be submitted to and considered by the Town Council at said hearing prior
to final action being taken on the name change.
   E.   The Town Council may initiate and pursue a street name change process
that varies from the above-described procedure if, under the particular
circumstances, equivalent notice and opportunity to be heard has been given to
affected property owners, service organizations, and the Postal Service prior
to final action being taken by the Council by resolution.

1-11-080   Address Numbers.
   A.   The system by which addresses are assigned in Prescott Valley shall be
based upon the Grid Street Addressing System adopted by Yavapai County on

location of the lot, parcel and/or building within the grid system.
      3.   A street name.
   C.   Addresses shall be assigned to lots, parcels and/or buildings at their
point of frontage on a named street. Buildings on corner lots or parcels shall
be assigned an address at their point of frontage on the street facing their
front elevation (regardless of which street is accessed by the driveway).
However, other large lots or parcels (or buildings thereon) may be assigned an
address on the street accessed by the driveway, at the point of access.
   D.   Where two (2) or more separate businesses or residences are contained
in one (1) building, a single address shall be assigned to that building or
complex and unit numbers or letters shall be assigned to each door thereof by
the property owner. Private clustered housing developments with no more than

   A.   Purchasing Officer. The Town Manager is the purchasing officer for the
Town. The Town Manager may, however, delegate purchasing duties to Department
Directors or other agents (and Department Directors may, in turn, delegate
purchasing duties to other responsible employees or agents). No purchase or
contract for purchase of any kind or description (payment for which is to be
made from funds of the Town) shall be made by the purchasing officer, or any
other officer, employee or agent of the Town, except in the manner set forth in
this Article and the related regulations adopted by the Town Council.
   B.   Purchase Defined. For purposes of this Article, a purchase involves
obtaining title, possession or use by means of monetary payment, including (but
expressly not limited to) renting, leasing or otherwise acquiring, any
materials, services, professional services or construction. Purchases hereunder
do not include obtaining title to or possession or use of real property.
   C.   Approving and Executing Required Documents. As purchasing officer, the
Town Manager may generally approve and execute all contracts or other documents
required for purchases as defined herein. However, purchases not expressly
anticipated in a Town Council-approved budget and requiring expenditures of
more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall require execution and
authentication by signature of the Mayor, following approval by the Council.
Nothing herein shall preclude Council approval and/or signature by the Mayor
based on other requirements set forth in Town regulations, other Town Code
provisions, Arizona statutes and regulations, or federal statutes and
regulations.
   D.   Public Bidding. Prior to approval and execution of contracts or other
documents required for purchases involving expenditures of more than fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) by either the Town Manager or the Mayor and
Council, the purchasing officer shall cause to be published in one (1) issue of
a newspaper of general circulation in the Town a notice inviting bids. The
notice shall be published at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the
receipt of the bids. The notice shall include a general description of the
articles to be purchased or services to be performed and the time and place for
opening bids. In addition, the purchasing officer shall post a notice inviting
bids in the Civic Center and may also mail to all responsible prospective
suppliers a copy of the notice inserted in the newspaper. To the extent other
requirements may apply based on related Town regulations, Town Code provisions,
Arizona statutes and regulations, or federal statutes and regulations, those
shall also be complied with. In the case of any conflicts with state or federal
statutes or regulations, the state or federal statutes or regulations shall
prevail.
   E.   Award to Low Responsive Bidder. The bid (and any related contract)
shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. However, the
Town Manager or Council may, in their respective discretion, reject any and all
bids and parts of all bids, and direct staff to re- advertise for bid or take
other action.
   F.   Change Orders. The Town Manager may approve and execute change orders
to contracts awarded after public bidding (regardless of whether the contracts
were initially approved and executed by the Town Manager or the Town Council
and Mayor) as follows:
   $000,000 to $1,000,000 award      up to $50,000 total
   $1,000,001 to $5,000,000 award      up to 10% with $250,000 maximum
   $5,000,001 award and up         up to 5%
   Change orders beyond those specified in this subsection may only be approved
by the Council for signature by the Mayor (regardless of whether the contracts
were initially approved and executed by the Town Manager or the Council and
Mayor). Nothing herein shall preclude the Town Manager from approving such
change orders if the Manager reasonably determines that doing so will avoid
unnecessary contractor delay claims or costs or public health or safety hazards
that would otherwise occur while awaiting Town Council approval (provided the
matter is presented to the Council for ratification as soon as practicable).

for resolution. On or before June 30 (August 17 in the first year), all areas
of agreement, as well as those areas in dispute and still under consideration,

impounded dog or cat bearing some form of identification and advise of the
location of the dog or cat and the requirements to reclaim the animal.

or safety of other animals may immediately impound any animal that appears to
be cruelly neglected or otherwise cruelly mistreated as described in this
Section. The Animal Control Officer shall then request a hearing pursuant to
Section 6-05-030 of this Chapter for the disposition of the impounded animal.
   F.   Nothing contained herein shall prohibit or restrict any activity
involving a dog, whether the dog is restrained or not, if the activity is

6-04-020   Confining Animals in Motor Vehicles.
   A.   No person having charge or custody of an animal, as owner or otherwise,
shall place or confine such animal or allow such animal to be placed or
confined or to remain in a motor vehicle under such conditions or for such
period of time as may endanger the health or well-being of such animal due to
heat, lack of food or drink, or such other circumstances as may reasonably be
expected to cause suffering, disability or death.
   B.   The Animal Control Officer or a peace officer may use reasonable force
to open a vehicle to rescue an animal if the animal is left in a vehicle in
violation of this Section. In the event the owner or custodian of the animal
cannot be located, the officer removing the animal shall place the animal in
the Town-authorized pound or veterinary hospital. The officer shall leave, in a
prominent place in the motor vehicle, a written notice bearing the address
where the animal may be claimed by the owner of the animal. The animal will be
surrendered to the owner if the owner claims the animal within ten (10) days
from the time the animal was removed from the motor vehicle and pays all
reasonable charges that have accrued for the maintenance of the animal,
including any and all costs for veterinary care. If the owner fails to claim
the animal within five (5) days after its removal from the motor vehicle, the
person or Town- authorized pound having custody of the animal will make a
reasonable effort to contact the owner and give notice that the animal is in
their custody and may be reclaimed upon payment of the reasonable maintenance
charges. If, after 10 days from the time the animal was removed from the motor
vehicle, the owner cannot be contacted, or fails or refuses to reclaim the
animal, the animal will be deemed unowned and the person or Town-authorized
pound having custody of the animal may dispose of the animal in accordance with
Section
6-01-130 of this Chapter.
   C.   Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prohibit the transportation
of horses, cattle, sheep, poultry or other agricultural livestock in trailers
or other vehicles designed and constructed for such purpose.

   A.   The Animal Services Officer or a peace officer who has impounded an
animal pursuant to Sections
6-02-010 and
6-02-020 of this Chapter, on a showing of probable cause that the animal is
vicious or may be a danger to the safety of any person or other animal, shall
request a disposition hearing before the Magistrate Court to determine whether
the animal is vicious. The hearing shall be set within fifteen (15) business
days after the request for a disposition hearing has been filed.
   B.   The Animal Services Officer or peace officer requesting the disposition
hearing shall, within seven (7) calendar days before the date of the hearing,

   A.   The Animal Services Officer or a peace officer who lawfully seizes an
animal pursuant to
Article 6-04 of this Chapter or A.R.S. §13-2910 shall affix a notice of seizure
in a conspicuous place where the animal was found or personally deliver the
notice of seizure to the owner or keeper of the animal, if known or
ascertainable after reasonable investigation. The Animal Services Officer shall
file proof of service with the Magistrate Court. If it is determined that the
suffering of the animal does not require humane destruction, the notice shall
include the following:
      1.   The name, business address and telephone number of the person
providing the notice.
      2.   A description of the seized animal.
      3.   The authority and purpose for the seizure, including the time, place
and circumstance under which the animal was seized.
      4.   A statement that in order to receive a post-seizure hearing the
owner or person authorized to keep the animal, or the owner or person s agent,
shall request the hearing by signing and returning to the Magistrate Court an
enclosed declaration of ownership or right to keep the animal within ten days,
including weekends and holidays, after the date of the notice.
      5.   A statement that the owner is responsible for the cost of care for
an animal that was properly seized and that the owner is required to post a
bond in the amount of twenty-five dollars per animal with the Magistrate Court
to defray the cost of care.
      6.   A warning that if the owner fails to post a bond within ten days
after the seizure, the animal will be deemed abandoned and become the property
of the seizing agency.
   B.   On receipt of a declaration of ownership and post-seizure hearing
request, the Magistrate shall set a hearing date within fifteen business days.
At the hearing, the Animal Control Office shall have the burden of establishing
by a preponderance of evidence that the animal was subjected to cruel
mistreatment, cruel neglect or abandonment in violation of
Article 6-04 of this Chapter or A.R.S. §13-2910 or will suffer needlessly if
humane destruction is delayed. On this finding, the Magistrate Court may
terminate the owner’s rights in the animal and transfer the rights to the
Animal Control Officer or a designated animal care agency and shall forfeit the
bond to pay the expenses incurred for the housing, care and treatment of the
animal. If at the conclusion of the hearing the animal is not forfeited under
this section, the court shall order the bond exonerated and returned to the
owner.
   C.   If the owner or person authorized to keep the animal fails to post bond
as prescribed by this section, fails to request a hearing or fails to attend a
scheduled hearing, the animal is deemed abandoned and all rights of the owner
in the animal are transferred to the Animal Control Officer.

7-01-030   Application to Existing Buildings and Building Service Equipment.
   A.   General. Buildings, structures and their building service equipment to
which additions, alterations or repairs are made shall comply with all the
requirements of the technical codes for new facilities except as specifically
provided in this section. For purposes of those technical codes, installations
or occupancies which are legally in existence on the effective date of those
codes shall be permitted to continue, as described in subparagraphs C and D
below, until such time as:
      1.    There is a change of occupancy or use classification; or
      2.    There is an addition or remodel which affects greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the existing floor area; or
      3.    There is an addition or alteration which will result in the
building or structure being more hazardous based on life safety, fire safety,
or sanitation.
      If a building permit for a structure under construction on the effective
date of those technical codes expires or has expired, the provisions of Section
7-01-160(D) of this administrative code shall apply.
      Determinations as to change of use or occupancy classification,
percentage of affected square footage, and change in hazard under this
provision shall be made by the building official.
   B.   Additions, Alterations or Repairs. Additions, alterations or repairs
may be made to a building or its building service equipment without requiring
the existing building or its building service equipment to comply with all the
requirements of the technical codes, provided the addition, alteration or
repair conforms to that required for a new building or building service
equipment.
      Additions or alterations shall not be made to an existing building or
building service equipment which will cause the existing building or building
service equipment to be in violation of the provisions of the technical codes
nor shall such additions or alterations cause the existing building or building
service equipment to become unsafe. An unsafe condition shall be deemed to have
been created if an addition or alteration will cause the existing building or
building service equipment to become structurally unsafe or overloaded; will
not provide adequate egress in compliance with the provisions of the technical
codes or will cause the existing building service equipment to become
overloaded or exceed its rated capacity; will create a health hazard or will
otherwise create conditions dangerous to human life. A building so altered,
which involves a change in use or occupancy, shall not exceed the height,
number of stories and area permitted by the technical codes for new buildings.
A building plus new additions shall not exceed the height, number of stories
and area specified by the technical codes for new buildings.
      Additions or alterations shall not be made to an existing building or
structure when the existing building or structure is not in full compliance
with the provisions of the technical codes except when the addition or
alteration will result in the existing building or structure being no more
hazardous, based on life safety, fire safety and sanitation, than before such
additions or alterations are undertaken.
      EXCEPTION: Alterations of existing structural elements, or additions of
new structural elements which are not required by subparagraph D and which are
initiated for the purpose of increasing the lateral-force-resisting strength or
stiffness of an existing structure need not be designed for forces conforming
to these regulations provided that an engineering analysis is submitted to show
that:
      1.    The capacity of existing structural elements required to resist
forces is not reduced, and
      2.    The lateral loading to required existing structural elements is not
increased beyond their capacity, and
      3.    New structural elements are detailed and connected to the existing
structural elements as required by these regulations, and

the greater safety to life shall govern. In other conflicts where sanitation,
life safety or fire safety are not involved, the most restrictive provisions
shall govern.

different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most
restrictive shall govern. When there is a conflict between a general
requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be
applicable.

installation of any material or to prohibit any design or method of
construction not specifically prescribed by the technical codes, provided that
any such alternative has been approved. An alternative material, design or
method of construction shall be approved where the building official finds that
the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the
provisions of the technical codes, and that the material, method or work
offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that

recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test
methods, the building official shall determine the test procedures.

public records.

technical codes. For such purposes, the building official shall have the powers
of a law enforcement officer.
      The building official shall have the authority to render interpretations
of this administrative code and the referenced technical codes, and to adopt
and enforce rules and regulations supplemental to this administrative code as
may be deemed necessary to clarify the application of the provisions of this
administrative code. Such interpretations, rules and regulations shall be in
conformity with the intent and purpose of this administrative code.
      Whenever the term or title "administrative authority", "responsible
official", "building official", "chief inspector", "code enforcement officer",
"code officer", or other similar designation is used herein or in any of the
technical codes, it shall be construed to mean the building official of the
Town of Prescott Valley.
   B.   Representatives. In accordance with prescribed procedures and with the
approval of the appointing authority, the building official may appoint
technical officers, inspectors and other employees as duly-authorized
representatives as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the code
enforcement agency.
   C.   Right of Entry. When necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of
the provisions of this administrative code and the technical codes, or when the
building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any
building or upon a premises a condition which is contrary to, or in violation
of, this administrative code or the technical codes which makes the building or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the building official is authorized to
enter the building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect or to perform
the duties imposed by this administrative code, provided that if such building
or premises be occupied, that credentials be presented to the occupant and
entry requested. If such building or premises be unoccupied, the building
official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other
persons having charge or control of the building or premises and request entry.
If entry is refused, the building official shall have recourse to the remedies
provided by law to secure entry.
   D.   Stop Work Orders. When work is being done contrary to the provisions of
this administrative code, the technical codes, or other pertinent laws or
ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this administrative code, the
building official may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on
persons engaged in the doing or causing such work to be done, and such persons
shall forthwith stop the work until authorized by the building official to
proceed with the work.
   E.   Occupancy Violations. When a building or structure or building service
equipment therein regulated by this administrative code and the technical codes
is being used contrary to the provisions of such codes, the building official
may order such use discontinued by written notice served on any person causing
such use to be continued. Such person shall discontinue the use within the time
prescribed by the building official after receipt of such notice to make the
structure, or portion thereof, comply with the requirement of such codes.
   F.   Authority to Connect and Disconnect Utilities. The building official
shall have the authority to disconnect a utility service or energy supplied to
the building, structure or building service equipment therein regulated by this
administrative code or the technical codes in case of emergency where necessary
to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The building official
shall, whenever possible, notify the serving utility, the owner and occupant of
the building, structure or building service equipment of the decision to
disconnect prior to taking such action, and shall notify such serving utility,
owner and occupant of the building, structure or building service equipment, in
writing, of such disconnection immediately thereafter.
      No sewer, water, electrical, natural gas, or propane services or meters
shall be connected for any new service by the utility providing sewer, water,
electrical, natural gas, or propane service until clearance has been issued by
the building official. Clearance shall not be issued until compliance with all
appropriate provisions of the Prescott Valley Town Code (including the
technical codes) has been verified by inspection. The building official may
designate persons to provide such clearance (oral or written) to the utility
providing sewer, water, electrical, natural gas, or propane service.
      Furthermore, a Certificate of Occupancy (CO) will be issued only after
all Prescott Valley zoning, engineering and building requirements are
completed, or enforceable arrangements have been made with the appropriate Town
departments for completion of those requirements. The building official may
issue clearance for temporary sewer, water, electrical, natural gas, or propane
service, or temporary occupancy if any non-compliance holding up permanent
service or occupancy will not result in hazard to health, safety or welfare. If
the building or structure is occupied prior to completion of the above
requirements, or if a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO) is revoked by
the building official, the building official may, at his option, order sewer,
water, electrical, natural gas or propane service disconnected after due notice
to the occupant and the affected utility.
   G.   Authority to Condemn Building Service Equipment. When the building
official ascertains that building service equipment regulated in the technical
codes has become hazardous to life, health or property, or has become
unsanitary, the building official shall order in writing that such equipment
either be removed or restored to a safe or sanitary condition, as appropriate.
The written notice itself shall fix a time limit for compliance with such
order. Defective building service equipment shall not be maintained after
receiving such notice.
      When such equipment or installation is to be disconnected, a written
notice of such disconnection and causes therefore shall be given within 24
hours to the serving utility, the owner and occupant of such building,
structure or premises.
      When any building service equipment is maintained in violation of the
technical codes and in violation of a notice issued pursuant to the provisions
of this section, the building official shall institute appropriate action to
prevent, restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   H.   Connection After Order to Disconnect. Persons shall not make
connections from an energy, fuel or power supply nor supply energy or fuel to
building service equipment which has been disconnected or ordered to be
disconnected by the building official or the use of which has been ordered to
be disconnected by the building official until the building official authorizes
the reconnection and use of such equipment.
   I.   Liability. The building official or employee charged with the
enforcement of this administrative code and the technical codes, while acting
for the Town in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the duties
required by this administrative code and the technical codes or other pertinent
laws or ordinances, shall not thereby be rendered personally liable and is
hereby relieved from personal liability for any damage accruing to persons or
property as a result of any act or by reason of an act or omission in the
discharge of official duties. Any suit instituted against an officer or
employee because of an act performed by that officer or employee in the lawful
discharge of duties and under the provisions of this administrative code and
the technical codes shall be defended by a legal representative of the Town
until the final termination of the proceedings, and any judgment resulting
therefrom shall be assumed by the Town.
      This administrative code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen
the responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling a building,
structure or building service equipment therein for damages to persons or
property caused by defects, nor shall the Town be held as assuming such
liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this administrative code
or permits or certificates issued under this administrative code.
   J.   Cooperation of Other Officials and Officers. The building official may
request, and shall receive, the assistance and cooperation of Town officials so
far as is required in the discharge of the duties required by this
administrative code, the technical codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances.
   K.   Recording Notices of Violation. The building official or a designee may
record notices of violation of this administrative code and the technical codes
in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder. Such notices of violation shall
run with the land and shall constitute notice for all purposes of this Chapter
to all persons or entities thereafter acquiring an interest in the property.
Failure to record any notice otherwise given by the building official under
this Chapter shall not affect the validity of said notice as to persons who
actually receive the same. When property is brought into compliance, the
building official (or designee) may record a satisfaction of notice of
violation in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder with or without a
request by any holder of an interest in said property.

and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit
therefore as soon as practicable.
   C.    Time Limitation of Application. An application for a permit for any
proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned 180 days after the date of
filing, unless such application has been pursued in good faith or a permit has
been issued. The building official is authorized to grant one extension of time
not exceeding 180 days. The extension shall be requested in writing and
justifiable cause demonstrated.
   D.    Submittal Documents. Plans, specifications (including fireplace and
sewer ejector pump specifications), engineering calculations, diagrams, soil
investigation reports, special inspection and structural observation programs,
a survey of lot and boundary monuments and other data shall constitute the
submittal documents and shall be submitted in one or more sets with each
application for a permit.
      When construction documents are required to contain a seal of a qualified
registrant according to ARS §32-144 (State Board of Technical Registration),
all mechanical and plumbing designs shall also contain a seal of a qualified
registrant. The building official may require the applicant submitting such
plans or other data to demonstrate that the State Board of Technical
Registration does not require that the construction documents, as submitted, be
prepared by a licensed professional. Where special conditions exist, the
building official may require plans, computations and specifications to be
prepared and designed by a qualified registrant.
         EXCEPTION:    The building official may waive the submission of plans,
calculations, construction inspection requirements and other data if it is
found that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of plans
is not necessary to obtain compliance with this administrative code and the
technical codes.
   E.    Information on Plans and Specifications. Plans and specifications
shall be drawn to scale on substantial paper or cloth and shall be of
sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work
proposed and show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this
administrative code, the technical codes and all relevant laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations.

occupancies except Group R-2, R-3, and U, the plans and specifications shall
designate the number of occupants to be accommodated on every floor and in all
rooms and spaces.
   F.    Manufacturer's Installation Instructions. Manufacturer's installation
instructions, as required by this administrative code and/or the technical
codes, shall be available on the job site at the time of inspection and may be

to be examined the accompanying construction documents and shall ascertain by
such examination whether the construction indicated and described is in
accordance with the requirements of this administrative code, the technical
codes and pertinent laws or ordinances. Such plans may be reviewed and approved
by other departments of the Town of Prescott Valley and other agencies with
jurisdiction in the area of public health and safety prior to permit issuance.
   H.    Review of Construction Documents. When the building official issues a
permit, the construction documents shall be designated “Reviewed for code
compliance” by stamp or in writing. One set of the reviewed construction
documents shall be retained by the building official. The other set shall be
returned to the applicant, shall be kept at the project site and shall be open
to inspection by the building official.
   I.    Previous Approvals. This administrative code shall not require changes
in the construction documents, construction or designated occupancy of a
structure for which a lawful permit has been issued or otherwise lawfully
authorized where the construction of same has been pursued in good faith within
180 days after the effective date of this administrative code and has not been
abandoned.
   J.    Phased Approval. The building official is authorized to issue a permit
for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or
structure before the construction documents for the complete building or
structure have been submitted, provided that adequate information and detailed
statements have been filed incompliance with pertinent requirements of the
technical codes as adopted by the Town of Prescott Valley. The holder of such
permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure shall
proceed at the holder’s own risk with the building operation and without
assurance that a permit for the entire structure or building will be granted.
   K.    Architect or Engineer of Record. When it is required that documents be
prepared by an architect or engineer, the building official may require the
owner to engage and designate on the building permit application an architect
or engineer who shall act as the architect or engineer of record. If the
circumstances require, the owner may designate a substitute architect or
engineer of record who shall perform all the duties required of the original
architect or engineer of record. The building official shall be notified in
writing by the owner if the architect or engineer of record is changed or is
unable to continue to perform the duties.
      The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing
and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred
submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building.
   L.    Deferred Submittals. For the purposes of this section, deferred
submittals are defined as those portions of the design which are not submitted
at the time of the application and which are to be submitted to the building
official within a specified period.
      Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the building
official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the deferred
submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal documents for
review by the building official.
      Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to
the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to
the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal
documents have been reviewed and found to be in general conformance with the
design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed
until their design and submittal documents have been approved by the building
official.
   M.    Amended Construction Documents. Work shall be installed in accordance
with the approved construction documents, and any changes made during
construction that are not in compliance with the approved construction
documents shall be resubmitted for approval as an amended set of construction
documents.
         EXCEPTION: The building official may waive the submittal of amended
construction documents if it is found that the nature of the changes are such
that review of amended plans is not necessary to obtain compliance with the
technical codes as adopted by the Town of Prescott Valley.
   N.    Retention of Construction Documents. One set of approved construction
documents shall be retained by the building official for a period of not less
than 90 days from the date of completion of the permitted work [for which a
certificate of occupancy is issued as per Section
7-01-190(C) of this administrative code] or as required by state or local laws,
whichever is more restrictive.
   O.    Inspection and Observation Program. When special inspection is
required by the technical codes, the architect or engineer of record shall
prepare an inspection program which shall be submitted to the building official
for approval prior to issuance of the building permit. The inspection program
shall designate the portions of the work to have special inspection, the name
or names of the individuals or firms who are to perform the special inspections
and shall indicate the duties of the special inspectors.
      When structural observation is required by the technical codes, the
inspection program shall name the individuals or firms who are to perform
structural observation and shall describe the stages of construction at which
structural observation is to occur.
      The special inspector shall be employed by the owner, the engineer or
architect of record, or an agent of the owner, but not the contractor or any
other person responsible for the work.
      The inspection program shall include samples of inspection reports and
provide time limits for submission of reports.

7-01-160   Permit Issuance.
   A.    Issuance. The application, plans, specifications, computations and
other data filed by an applicant for permit shall be reviewed by the building
official. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of the Town of
Prescott Valley to verify compliance with applicable laws. If the building
official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the
plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the
requirements of this administrative code and the technical codes and other
pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fees specified in Section
7-01-200 of this administrative code have been paid, the building official
shall issue a permit therefore to the applicant.
      The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of
a building, structure or building service equipment before the entire plans and
specifications for the whole building, structure or building service equipment
have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed
statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of the
technical codes. The holder of a partial permit shall proceed without assurance
that the permit for the entire building, structure or building service
equipment will be granted.
   B.    Validity of Permit. The issuance of a permit or approval of plans,
specifications and computations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or
an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this administrative
code, the technical codes or any other ordinance of the Town of Prescott
Valley. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions
of this administrative code, the technical codes or other ordinances of the
Town of Prescott Valley shall not be valid.
      The issuance of a permit based on plans, specifications and other data
shall not prevent the building official from subsequently requiring correction
of errors in said plans, specifications and other data, or from preventing
building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of these
codes or any other ordinances of the Town of Prescott Valley.
   C.    Expiration. Every permit issued under this administrative code and the
technical codes shall expire if the work authorized by the permit is not (1)
commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance of the
permit, or (2) completed within three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the
date of first approval of the first inspection date. Failure to commence or
complete work authorized by a permit within the time frames specified in this
section is a violation of
Chapter 7 “Building” of the Prescott Valley Town Code punishable pursuant to
Section
7-01-130 of this administrative code.
      Where a permit has expired because of permittee’s failure to commence
authorized work within one hundred eighty (180) days of issuance, no authorized
work may be commenced thereafter until a new permit is issued. If no change has
been made or will be made to the original plans and specifications for such
work, the fee for the new permit shall be one-half (1/2) the amount normally
required for a new permit. Otherwise, a full permit fee will be required.
      Where a permit has expired because of permittee’s failure to complete the
authorized work and obtain a Certificate of Occupancy (CO) within three hundred
sixty-five (365) days of first approval of the first inspection, the building
official may grant a one-time extension not to exceed one hundred eighty (180)
days. This extension will have a required, nonrefundable investigation fee, as
specified in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule, that shall accompany the written
request for extension. A second extension of one hundred eighty (180) days may
be approved by the Building Official upon payment of a new permit fee. Both
extension requests shall be in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.
      The permittee has the burden of producing, upon the request of the
building official, receipts, invoices, billing statements or other objective
evidence showing (respectively) when the building or other authorized work
commenced under the permit.
   D.    Suspension or Revocation. The building official may, in writing,
suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this administrative
code and the technical codes when the permit is issued in error or on the basis
of incorrect information supplied to the building official, or in violation of
an ordinance or regulation or the provisions of these codes.

   A.    General. Fees shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions of
this section and as set forth in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule.
   B.    Permit Fees. The fee for each permit shall be based upon valuation as
set forth in "Table 1 - Valuation Schedule" (hereinafter "Table 1"). However,
the building official has discretion to accept the valuation supplied by the
applicant in place of the "Valuation Schedule." There shall be no exemption
from fees other than that listed in subparagraph 5 below. Furthermore, with
regard to fees:
      1.   Permit fees for factory-built buildings and manufactured homes

on written request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the
control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. An application
shall not be extended more than once. An application shall not be extended if
this administrative code, the technical codes or any other pertinent laws or
ordinances have been amended subsequent to the date of application. In order to
renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit
plans and pay a new plan review fee.
   E.    Investigation Fees: Work Without the Required Permit.
      1.    Investigation Fee. Whenever work for which a permit is required by

special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such
work. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected
whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee
shall be equal to the amount specified in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule. The

codes, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the
job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection.
            Re-inspection fees may be assessed for any reason including but not
limited to the following:
            When the Building Display Card is not posted or otherwise displayed
on the work site.

building service equipment is concealed by permanent portions of the building.
      3.    Other Inspections. In addition to the called inspections specified
above, the building official may make or require other inspections of
construction work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this
administrative code and technical codes and other laws which are enforced by
the Town of Prescott Valley.
      4.    Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each
inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is
called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made.
         This section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees
the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of
the technical codes, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections
before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection.
         Reinspection fees may be assessed when the permit card is not posted
on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the
inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is

details of subsurface drains shall be shown as reported by the soils engineer.
The civil engineer shall state in a sealed letter of certification that the as-
built plan, to the best of his/her knowledge, certifies that the work within
his/her area of responsibility was performed in accordance with the final
approved Drainage and Grading Plan.
      *An as-built Drainage and Grading Plan may be required for drainage and
grading work completed under a regular grading and drainage permit if, in the
opinion of the building official, the finished drainage or grading work is
substantially different than that proposed in the drainage and grading plan
approved at the time of permitting. The as-built plan must include as-built
information on all items found on the earlier proposed Drainage and Grading
Plan.
      2.   A report prepared by a soils engineer including locations and
elevations of field density tests, summaries of field and laboratory tests,
other substantiating data, and comments on any changes made during grading and
their effect on the recommendations made in the approved soils engineering
investigation report. The soils engineer shall submit a statement in the report
that, to the best of his/her knowledge, the work within his/her area of
responsibility was performed in accordance with the approved soils engineering
report and applicable provisions of this Appendix.
      3.   A report prepared by an engineering geologist including a final
description of the geology of the site and any new information disclosed during
the grading, and the effect of same on recommendations incorporated in the
approved grading plan. The engineering geologist shall submit a statement in
the report that, to the best of his/her knowledge, the work within his/her area
of responsibility was performed in accordance with the approved engineering
geologist report and applicable provisions of this Appendix.
      4.   The grading contractor shall submit, in a form prescribed by the
building official, a statement of conformance to the as-built plan and the
specifications.
J104.6 Notice of Completion. The permittee shall notify the building official
when the grading operation is ready for final inspection. Final approval shall
not be given until all work, including installation of all drainage facilities
and their protective devices as well as all erosion-control measures, have been
completed in accordance with the final, approved grading plan and the Final
Reports referenced in Subsection J104.5 above have been submitted.
SECTION J105 GRADING AND DRAINAGE WORK
J105.1 Cuts. The slope of cut surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for the
intended use, and in no event shall be steeper than 2 horizontal to 1 vertical
(2:1) unless the permittee furnishes a soils engineering or an engineering
geology report (or both) stating that the site has been investigated, and
giving an opinion that a cut at a steeper slope will be stable and not create a
hazard to public or private property. Acceptance of slopes greater than 2:
1 shall be at the discretion of the building official.
      Exception: In the absence of an approved soils engineering report, the
requirements in Section J105.2 above may be waived in whole or part for minor
cuts not intended to support structures.
J105.2 Fills. Unless otherwise recommended in the approved soils engineering
report, fills shall conform to the provisions of this Appendix.
      Exception: In the absence of an approved soils engineering report, the
requirements in this Section J105.2 may be waived in whole or part for minor
fills not intended to support structures.
J105.2.1 Preparation of Ground. Fill slopes shall not be constructed on natural
slopes steeper than 2:1. The ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill
by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable
materials, and scarifying the ground to provide a bond with the new fill. Where
slopes are steeper than 5:1 and the height is greater than 5 feet, the ground
surface shall be prepared by benching into sound bedrock or other competent
material as determined by the soils engineer or the building official. The
bench under the toe of a fill on a slope steeper than 5:1 shall be at least 10
feet wide. Either the area beyond the toe of fill shall be sloped for sheet
overflow, or a drain shall be provided. When fill is to be placed over a cut,
the bench under the toe of fill shall be at least 10 feet wide. Furthermore,
the cut shall be made before placing the fill and shall first be accepted by a
soils engineer or engineering geologist (or both) as being suitable foundation
for fill.
J105.2.2 Fill Material. Detrimental amounts of organic material shall not be
permitted in fills. Except as permitted by the building official, no rock or
similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than 12 inches
shall be buried or placed in fills.
      Exception: The building official may permit placement of larger rock when
the soils engineer properly devises a method of placement, continuously
inspects its placement, and approves the fill stability. In that event, the
following conditions shall apply:
      1.   Prior to issuance of the grading permit, potential rock disposal
areas shall be delineated on the grading plan.
      2.   Rock sizes greater than 12 inches in maximum dimension shall be 10
feet or more below grade (measured vertically).
      3.   Rocks shall be placed so as to assure filling of all voids with
well-graded soil.
J105.2.3 Compaction. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of 90 percent of
maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557, modified proctor, in lifts not
exceeding 12 inches in depth.
J105.2.4 Slope. The slope of fill surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for
the intended use, and in no event shall fill slopes be steeper than 2
horizontal to 1 vertical (2:1) without the justification of a soils report.
J105.3 Setbacks. Cut and fill slopes shall be set back from site boundaries in
accordance with this Appendix. Setback dimensions shall be horizontal distances
measured perpendicular to the site boundary. Setback dimensions shall be as
shown in the following Figure A-J-1 of this Appendix.
FIGURE A-J-1 - SETBACK DIMENSIONS

IMAGES/0-0-0-2358.png]
J105.3.1 Top of Cut Slope. The top of cut slopes shall not be made nearer to a
site boundary line than one fifth of the vertical height of the cut, with a
minimum of 2 feet and a maximum of 10 feet. When a public or utility easement
exists on or through a site (or, in the opinion of the building official, may
be required in the future), the top of cut slopes shall be made not nearer to
the existing or proposed easement boundary than one-fifth of the vertical
height of the cut, with a maximum of 10 feet. The setback may need to be
increased for any required interceptor drains or berms. Interceptor drains or
berms are not allowed within existing easements unless the easement is
designated as a drainage easement. Where a cut slope is to be located near the
site boundary, or where a cut slope has a vertical height greater than 30
inches and less than 10 feet with a slope of 2’ horizontal to 1’ vertical (2:1)
or less, or where a cut slope has a vertical height greater than 10 feet with a
slope of less than 3’ horizontal to 1’ vertical (3:1), the owner/developer of
the property shall submit to the building official a plan endorsed by a
qualified engineer to implement reasonable safety precautions in order to
eliminate any and all hazards arising from the cut slope or, in the
alternative, shall install safety precautions in accordance with the standards
set forth in Section 1015 “Guards” in Chapter 10 “Means of Egress” of the
International Building Code (as hereinafter adopted and amended by
Chapter 7 of the Prescott Valley Town Code). Safety precautions endorsed by an
engineer may include, but are not limited to:
      1.   additional setbacks;
      2.   provision for walls, fencing or barricading for retaining and/or
fall protection;
      3.   mechanical, chemical or physical treatment of the cut slope surface
to minimize erosion; and
      4.   erosion control and provision for the control of surface waters.
J105.3.2 Toe of Fill Slope. The toe of fill slope shall be made not nearer to
the site boundary line than one-half the height of the slope, with a minimum of
2 feet and a maximum of 20 feet. When a public or utility easement exists on or
through a site (or, in the opinion of the building official, such an easement
may be required in the future), the toe of fill slope shall be made no nearer
than the existing or proposed easement boundary, with no fill material being
placed in the easement. Where a fill slope is to be located near the site
boundary, or where a fill slope has a vertical height greater than 30 inches
and less than 10 feet with a slope of 2’ horizontal to 1’ vertical (2:1) or
less, or where a fill slope has a vertical height greater than 10 feet with a
slope of less than 3’ horizontal to 1’ vertical (3:1), the owner/developer of
the property shall submit to the building official a plan endorsed by a
qualified engineer to implement reasonable safety precautions in order to
eliminate any and all hazards arising from the fill slope or, in the
alternative, shall provide safety precautions in accordance with the standards
set forth in Section 1015 “Guards” in Chapter 10 “Means of Egress” of the
International Building Code (as hereinafter adopted and amended by
Chapter 7 of the Prescott Valley Town Code). Safety precautions endorsed by an
engineer may include, but are not limited to:
      1.   additional setbacks;
      2.   provision for walls, fencing or barricading for retaining and/or
fall protection;
      3.   mechanical, chemical or physical treatment of the fill slope surface
to minimize erosion; and
      4.   erosion control and provision for the control of surface waters.
J105.3.3 Modification of Slope Location. The building official may require or
approve alternate setbacks. The building official may also require an
investigation and recommendation by a qualified engineer or engineering
geologist to demonstrate that the intent of this Appendix has been satisfied in
a particular case.
J105.4 Drainage and Terracing. Unless otherwise indicated on the approved
grading and drainage plan, drainage facilities and terracing shall conform to
the provisions of this Appendix for cut or fill slopes steeper than 3
horizontal to 1 vertical (3:1).
J105.4.1 Terrace. Terraces at least 6 feet in width shall be established at not
more than 30-foot vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes to control
surface drainage and debris. However, where only one terrace is required, it
shall be at mid-height. For cut or fill slopes greater than 60 feet and up to
120 feet in vertical height, one terrace at approximately mid-height shall be
12 feet in width. Terrace widths and spacing for cut and fill slopes greater
than 120 feet in height shall be designed by a civil engineer and approved by
the building official. Suitable access, including access for maintenance
vehicles, shall be provided to permit proper cleaning and maintenance of
terraces.
All swales or ditches on terraces shall be designed and constructed to prevent
erosion, provide suitable drainage and provide durability.
J105.4.2 Subsurface Drainage. Cut and fill slopes shall be provided with
subsurface drainage as necessary for stability.
J105.4.3 Disposal. All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry waters to
the nearest practicable drainage way approved by the building official (or by
another appropriate jurisdiction), as a safe place to deposit such waters. The
building official may require that the permittee secure necessary drainage
easements and provide a watercourse to a place approved by the building
official (or another appropriate jurisdiction) to receive such waters. Erosion
of ground in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of
noncorrosive downdrains or other devices.
Building pads shall have a drainage gradient of 2 percent toward approved
drainage facilities, unless the requirement is waived by the building official.
EXCEPTION: The gradient from a building pad may be 1 percent if all of the
following conditions exist throughout the permit area:
      1.   No fills are greater than 10 feet in maximum depth.
      2.   No finished cut or fill slope faces have a vertical height in excess
of 10 feet.
      3.   No existing slope faces which have a slope face steeper than 10
horizontal to 1 vertical (10:1) have a vertical height in excess of 10 feet.
J105.4.4 On-Site Detention. All developments, except single-family residential
or multi-family residential of 2 units or less on individually platted lots or
located in areas where regional detention has been approved through the
adoption of a master plan, shall be required to provide on-site detention of
storm water.
Wherever possible, storm water detention should be implemented on a regional
basis. The storm water detention program should utilize regional detention
based on a watershed-wide assessment of the effects of urbanization and
planning and development of facilities at the most effective locations to
minimize those effects. Such a watershed-wide assessment should include an
evaluation of the cumulative effects of urbanization such that the
implementation of the storm water detention program addresses both localized
increases in runoff and regional effects to the extent possible. Where such a
plan can be implemented, on-site detention should be avoided.
Where a regional watershed-wide detention program is not practical or
attainable, on-site detention shall be required to hold runoff to historic peak
levels for the full range of storm events from the 2-year through the 100-year
event. It is necessary to demonstrate that runoff peaks are maintained at
“undeveloped” levels for the 2-year, 10-year and 100-year storm events.
Policies, design procedures and safety considerations shall be as described in
the Yavapai County Drainage Criteria Manual, August 2005, Chapter 5,
“Stormwater Storage (Detention/Retention)."
J105.4.5 Interceptor Drains or Berms. Interceptor drains or berms shall be
installed along the top of all cut and/or fill slopes where the upslope
tributary area drains toward the cut or fill. Interceptor drains or berms shall
be graded to provide suitable drainage and shall be designed to prevent erosion
and provide durability.
J105.5 Erosion Control. The faces of cut and fill slopes shall be prepared and
maintained to control erosion, generally through effective planting. This
erosion protection shall be installed as soon as practicable and prior to
calling for final approval.
Exception:  Where cut slopes are not subject to erosion due to the erosion-
resistant character of the materials, such protection may be omitted upon
approval of the building official.
J105.5.1 Other Devices. Where necessary, check dams, cribbing, rip-rap or other
devices or methods shall be employed to control erosion.

Exception: Building sewers may be located in such a way as to preclude a
gravity-flow connection to an available public sewer if that building sewer is
otherwise connected to the available public sewer, and owners or developers
expressly agree in writing (for themselves and their successors-in-interest),
to 1) take complete financial responsibility for construction and on-going
maintenance of any non-gravity flow connection, and 2) to allow such agreement
to be recorded in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder upon payment of a
fee. Nothing herein shall otherwise modify any other provision of the Town Code
allocating responsibility for construction and maintenance of service
connections.
Prior to the availability of a public sewer as defined in Section 701.2 of the
International Plumbing Code, but after a preliminary design for such a public
sewer has been established and is available for review at the Development
Services Department, no building sewer shall be located in such a way as to
preclude a subsequent gravity-flow connection to that future public sewer.
Furthermore, the building sewer shall be located so as to minimize the length
of sewer service line that will be necessary to connect to the future public
sewer, by being located on the same half of the lot as the future public sewer
pipeline and by avoiding walls and fences wherever possible.
Exception: Building sewers may be located in such a way as to preclude a
subsequent gravity-flow connection to the future public sewer, or so as not to
minimize the length of sewer service line necessary to connect to the future
public sewer, if owners or developers expressly agree in writing (for
themselves and their successors-in-interest) to 1) take complete financial
responsibility for construction of any non- gravity flow connection at the time
of converting from private sewage disposal systems to the public sewer, 2) take
complete financial responsibility for on-going maintenance of any such non-
gravity flow connection at the time of converting from private sewage disposal
systems to the public sewer, 3) take complete financial responsibility for any
additional cost of constructing and maintaining sewer service lines beyond the
minimal length necessary at the time of converting from private sewage disposal
systems to the public sewer, and 4) allow such agreement to be recorded in the
Office of the Yavapai County Recorder upon payment of a fee. Nothing herein
shall otherwise modify any other provision of the Town Code allocating
responsibility for construction and maintenance of service connections.

SECTION 701 - GENERAL
. . .
701.2 Connection to Sewer Required. Every building in which plumbing fixtures
are installed and every premises having drainage piping thereon, shall have a
connection to a public or private sewer.
When a public sewer, intended to serve any lot or premises, is available in any
public easement, thoroughfare or right-of-way abutting such lot or premises,
drainage piping from any building or works shall be connected to the public
sewer.
Within the limits prescribed, the rearrangement or subdivision into smaller
parcels of a lot which abuts and is served by a public sewer shall not be
deemed cause to permit the construction of a private sewage disposal system,
and all plumbing or drainage systems on any such smaller parcel or parcels
shall connect to the public sewer.
The public sewer is considered available when such public sewer or any building
or any exterior drainage facility connected thereto, is located three hundred
(300) feet (91.2 m) or less from any proposed building or exterior drainage
facility on any lot or premises which abuts and is served by such public sewer.
No permit shall be issued for the installation, alteration or repair of any
private sewage disposal system or part thereof, on any lot for which a

connected with such public sewer.
   Exceptions:
      1.   Single family dwellings and buildings or structures accessory
thereto, existing and connected to an approved private sewage disposal system
prior to the time a public sewer is available may, when no hazard, nuisance or
unsanitary condition is evidenced and written permission has been obtained from
the building official, remain connected to such properly maintained private
sewage disposal system when there is insufficient grade or fall to permit
drainage to the public sewer by gravity. However, once the public sewer is
available, nothing herein shall be construed to authorize use of a private
sewage disposal system instead of connecting to the public sewer, including
insufficient grade or fall to permit gravity flow to the public sewer.
      2.    Any building, dwelling, facility or structure otherwise prohibited
from connecting to the public sewer by state or federal statute, rule or
regulation.
   B.   SECTION 701, GENERAL, Subsection 701.5, Damage to Drainage System or
Public Sewer, is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
SECTION 701 - GENERAL
. . .
701.5 Damage to Drainage System or Public Sewer. No rain, surface or subsurface
water shall be connected to, discharged into, or allowed to infiltrate in any
drainage system.
No building sewer shall be located in any lot other than the lot which is the
site of the building or structure served by such sewer; nor shall any building
sewer be located at any point having less than the minimum distances indicated
in Table 608.18.1 of the International Plumbing Code.
Nothing contained in this code shall be construed to prohibit the use of all or
part of an abutting lot to:
      1.    Provide access to connect a building sewer to an available public
sewer, when proper cause and legal easement not in violation of other
requirements has been first established to the satisfaction of the building
official.
      2.    Provide additional space for a building sewer when proper cause,
transfer of ownership, or change of boundary not in violation of other
requirements has been first established to the satisfaction of the building
official. The instrument recording such action shall constitute an agreement
with the building official, which shall clearly state and show that the areas
so joined or used shall be maintained as a unit (only for the purposes of this
Section) during the time they are so used. Such an agreement shall be recorded
in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder as part of the conditions of
ownership of said properties, and shall be binding on all heirs, successors and
assigns to such properties. A copy of the instrument recording such proceedings
shall be filed with the building official.
   C.    SECTION 704, DRAINAGE PIPING INSTALLATION, Subsection 704.1, Slope of
Horizontal Drainage Piping, is hereby amended by adding the following
subparagraphs and exceptions, to read as follows:
SECTION 704 - DRAINAGE PIPING INSTALLATION
. . .
704.1 Slope of Horizontal Drainage Piping.
. . .
No building sewer shall be located in such a way as to preclude a gravity-flow
connection to an available public sewer.
   Exception: Building sewers may be located in such a way as to preclude a
gravity-flow connection to an available public sewer if that building sewer is
otherwise connected to the available public sewer, and owners or developers
expressly agree in writing (for themselves and their successors-in-interest),
to 1) take complete financial responsibility for construction and on-going
maintenance of any non-gravity flow connection, and 2) to allow such agreement
to be recorded in the Office of the Yavapai County Recorder upon payment of a
fee. Nothing herein shall otherwise modify any other provision of the Town Code
allocating responsibility for construction and maintenance of service
connections.
Prior to the availability of a public sewer as defined in Section 701.2 of the
International Plumbing Code, but after a preliminary design for such a public
sewer has been established and is available for review at the Development
Services Department, no building sewer shall be located in such a way as to
preclude a subsequent gravity-flow connection to that future public sewer.
Furthermore, the building sewer shall be located so as to minimize the length
of sewer service line that will be necessary to connect to the future public
sewer, by being located on the same half of the lot as the future public sewer
pipeline and by avoiding walls and fences wherever possible.
   Exception: Building sewers may be located in such a way as to preclude a
subsequent gravity-flow connection to the future public sewer, or so as not to
minimize the length of sewer service line that will be necessary to connect to
the future public sewer, if owners or developers expressly agree in writing
(for themselves and their successors-in-interest) to 1) take complete financial
responsibility for construction of any non-gravity flow connection at the time
of converting from private sewage disposal systems to the public sewer, 2) take
complete financial responsibility for on-going maintenance of any such non-
gravity flow connection at the time of converting from private sewage disposal
systems to the public sewer, 3) take complete financial responsibility for any
additional cost of constructing and maintaining sewer service lines beyond the
minimal length necessary at the time of converting from private sewage disposal
systems to the public sewer, and 4) allow such agreement to be recorded in the
Office of the Yavapai County Recorder upon payment of a fee. Nothing herein
shall otherwise modify any other provision of the Town Code allocating
responsibility for construction and maintenance of service connections.
   D.   SECTION 708, CLEANOUTS, Subsection 708.1, Cleanouts Required,
Subsubsection 708.1.10, Cleanout Access, is hereby amended in its entirety to
read as follows:
   SECTION 708 - CLEANOUTS
   708.1 Cleanouts Required
   . . .
   708.1.10 Cleanout Access. Required cleanouts shall not be installed in
concealed locations. For the purposes of this section, concealed locations
include, but are not limited to, the inside of plenums, within walls, within
floor/ceiling assemblies, below grade and in crawl spaces where the height from
the crawl space floor to the nearest obstruction along the path from the crawl
space opening to the cleanout location is less than 24 inches (610 mm).
Cleanouts with openings at finished wall shall have the face of the opening
flush with the finished wall surface. Cleanouts located below grade shall be
extended to grade level so that the top of the cleanout plug is at or above
grade. A cleanout installed in a floor or walkway that will not have a trim
cover installed shall have a countersunk plug installed so the top surface of
the plug is flush with the finished surface of the floor or walkway.
   E.    SECTION 714, BACKWATER VALVES, Subsection 714.1, Sewage Backflow, is
hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

7-10-030   Street Pavement Cuts.
   A.   A Right of Way permit issued by the Public Works Department is required
for any person to cut into any street pavement or chip seal treatment, curb,
gutter, sidewalk, storm drain, culvert, bridge, pipe, or related improvement
maintained by the Town of Prescott Valley within any public right-of-way. An
inspection fee and bond calculated using the cut area may be applicable as
established from time to time by resolution of the Town Council.
   B.   Unless otherwise provided by supervening law, agreement, or permit
condition, any person who cuts into or otherwise damages any street pavement or
chip seal, pavement marking, curb, gutter, sidewalk, storm drain, culvert,
bridge, pipe or other related improvement maintained by the Town within any
public right-of-way (and is not a Town employee or Town contractor) must repair
said improvement at the person’s sole cost and expense and in accordance with
applicable Town standards and specifications (including, but not limited to,
those set forth herein).
      1.   There shall be no open trenching (pavement cut) on street pavements
less than five (5) years old. Any exceptions must be approved in writing by the
Town Engineer.
      2.   Patching for pavement cuts shall be made within twenty-four (24)
hours of completion of work as specified in Quad City Standard Detail 200Q-1.
      3.   Depending on condition of existing street pavements, additional
removal and replacement wider than the trench may be required. When the trench
of any lineal utility project is within three feet (3’) or less from lip of
gutter, the pavement area between the trench and lip of curb will also require
full removal and replacement. Any perpendicular pavement cut shall extend at a
minimum to the center of the travel lane to avoid a seam in the wheel path. Any
longitudinal joint/cut will not be allowed in the wheel path of the travel
lane. Pavement replacement shall be the minimum structural section for said
street classification. In no case shall the replacement of existing street
payments be less than three inches (3”) asphaltic concrete (AC) over six inches
(6”) aggregate base course (ABC) (the minimum residential section). In
addition, should any raveling or damage occur to the existing pavement within
the construction area, the damaged areas shall be saw cut, removed, and
replaced. Damage to curb, gutter and sidewalk shall require full panel removal
with saw cuts made at each joint. Removal and replacement of all existing
infrastructure, damaged pavement, concrete, landscaping, irrigation, etc.,
shall be at the person’s expense.
      4.   In lieu of street pavement cuts, persons may use boring and jacking.
Designs with pavement boring shall include a boring profile to ensure proper
separation is maintained from all existing utilities. Profiles of existing
utilities shall be potholed prior to start of work and included in the boring
profile. Utility potholes shall remain open with plate at critical crossings to
visually verify depth of bore and avoid utility conflicts.
   C.   Where the age of a street pavement is different for its respective
lanes based on phased construction, the applicable requirements may be applied
differently to the respective lanes to the extent reasonably possible.
   D.   For all pavements cut repair areas, a permittee must apply a tack coat
between the existing and new pavement areas prior to any pavement replacement.
   E.   For existing streets with chip seal treatment, a three-eighths inch (3/
8”) low volume chip seal with a fog seal may be applied. Repairs are intended
to match the existing surface treatment.

the Town. The actual impact fees to be assessed shall be disclosed and adopted
in the form of impact fee schedules adopted by Resolution of the Town Council
by the procedures contained herein.
   C.    Carry-over of Previously-Established Development Impact Fees and
Grandfathered Facilities. Notwithstanding the requirements of this Article,
certain development impact fees adopted by the Town prior to the effective date
of this Article shall continue in effect as follows:
      1.   Until August 1, 2014 or the date a new development impact fee is
adopted for the applicable Category of Necessary Public Services in a Service

established prior to January 1, 2012 shall continue in full force and effect to
the extent that the development impact fee is used to provide a Category of
Necessary Public Services that is authorized by Section
7-11-080 of this Article. Development impact fees collected prior to January 1,
2012, shall be expended on Capital Facilities within the same Category of
Necessary Public Services for which they were collected.
      2.   The Town may continue to collect and use any development impact fee
established before January 1, 2012, even if the development impact fee would
not otherwise be permitted to be collected and spent pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-

764, Rep&ReEn, 01/12/12)
7-11-080   Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
   A.   Infrastructure Improvements Plan Contents. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall be developed by Qualified Professionals and may be
based upon or incorporated within the Town’s Capital Improvements Plan. The
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall:
      1.   Specify the Categories of Necessary Public Services for which the
Town may impose a development impact fee, which may include any or all of the
following:
         a.   Storm Water, Drainage, and Flood Control
         b.   Libraries
         c.   Street Facilities
         d.   Police
         e.   Parks
      2.   Define and provide a map of one (1) or more Service Areas within
which the Town will provide each Category of Necessary Public Services for
which development impact fees will be charged. Each Service Area must be
defined in a manner that demonstrates a Substantial Nexus between the Capital
Facilities to be provided in the Service Area and the EDUs to be served by
those Capital Facilities. For Libraries and for Parks larger than thirty (30)
acres, each Service Area must be defined in a manner that demonstrates a Direct
Benefit between the Capital Facilities and the EDUs to be served by those
Capital Facilities. The Town may cover more than 1 category of Capital
Facilities in the same Service Area provided that there is an independent
Substantial Nexus or Direct Benefit, as applicable, between each Category of
Necessary Public Services and the EDUs to be served.
       3.   Identify and describe the Land Use Assumptions upon which the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based in each Service Area.
      4.   Analyze and identify the existing Level of Service provided by the
Town to existing EDUs for each Category of Necessary Public Services in each
Service Area.
      5.   Identify the Level of Service to be provided by the Town for each
Category of Necessary Public Services in each Service Area based on the
relevant Land Use Assumptions and any established Town standards or policies
related to required Levels of Service. If the Town provides the same Category
of Necessary Public Services in more than 1 Service Area, the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall include a comparison of the Levels of Service to be
provided in each Service Area.
      6.   For each Category of Necessary Public Services, analyze and identify
the existing capacity of the Capital Facilities in each Service Area, the
utilization of those Capital Facilities by existing EDUs, and the available
excess capacity of those Capital Facilities to serve new EDUs including any
existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage of such capacity.
The Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall additionally identify: (a) any
changes or upgrades to existing Capital Facilities that will be needed to
achieve or maintain the planned Level of Service to existing EDUs, or to meet
new safety, efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory requirements for
services provided to existing EDUs; and (b) those portions of Capital
Facilities that will be necessary to serve any new public school, private
school, or Town facility for which development impact fees will not be
assessed.
      7.   Identify any Grandfathered Facilities and the impact thereof on the
need for Necessary Public Services in each affected Service Area.
      8.   Estimate the total number of existing and future EDUs within each
Service Area based on the Town’s Land Use Assumptions and projected new EDUs in
each Service Area.
      9.   Based on the analysis in Subsections (3)-(6) above, provide a
summary table or tables describing the Level of Service for each Category of
Necessary Public Services by relating the required Capital Facilities to EDUs
in each Service Area, and identifying the applicable EDU factor associated with
each Category of Development.
      10.   For each Category of Necessary Public Services, analyze and
identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing
Capital Facilities, and all new or expanded Capital Facilities that will be
required to provide and maintain the planned Level of Service in each Service
Area as a result of the new projected EDUs in that Service Area, for a period
not to exceed ten (10) years. Nothing in this Subsection shall prohibit the
Town from additionally including in its Infrastructure Improvements Plan
projected utilization of, or needs for, Capital Facilities for a period longer
than 10 years, provided that the costs of such Capital Facilities are excluded
from the calculation of the Plan-Based Cost per EDU.
      11.   For each Category of Necessary Public Services, estimate the total
cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded Capital Facilities
that will be required to serve new EDUs, including costs of land acquisition,
improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to
design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs, as well as
projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include costs for
ongoing operation and maintenance of Capital Facilities, nor for replacement of
Capital Facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve
existing EDUs. If the Infrastructure Improvements Plan includes changes or
upgrades to existing Capital Facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned Level of Service to existing EDUs, or to meet new
regulatory requirements for services provided to existing EDUs, such costs
shall be identified and distinguished in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      12.   Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other
sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded Capital Facilities
identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, which shall include
estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad
valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and
the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based
on the approved land use assumptions. The Infrastructure Improvements Plan
shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct and
implement the new or expanded Capital Facilities.
      13.   Calculate required Offsets as follows:
         a.   From the forecasted revenues in Subsection (12) of this Section,
identify those sources of revenue that: (i) are attributable to new
development, and (ii) will contribute to paying for the capital costs of
Necessary Public Services.
         b.   For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to
Subsection (a) of this Subsection, calculate the relative contribution of each
Category of Development to paying for the capital costs of Necessary Public
Services in each Service Area.
         c.   Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to
Subsection (b) of this Subsection, for each Category of Necessary Public
Services, calculate the total Offset to be provided to each Category of
Development in each Service Area.
         d.   For each Category of Necessary Public Services, convert the total
Offset to be provided to each Category of Development in each Service Area into
an offset amount per EDU by dividing the total Offset for each Category of
Development by the number of EDUs associated with that Category of Development.
         e.   Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the
required Offset, if the Town imposes a construction, contracting, or similar
excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege
tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax
classifications in the Town, the entire excess portion of the construction,
contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the
capital costs of Necessary Public Services provided to new development unless
the excess portion is already utilized for such purpose pursuant to this
Section.
         f.   In determining the amount of required Offset for land included in
a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 4,
Article 6, the Town shall take into account any Capital Facilities provided by
the district that are included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and the
capital costs paid by the district for such Capital Facilities, and shall
offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district
proportionally.
      14.   Calculate the Plan-Based Cost per EDU by:
         a.   Dividing the total projected costs to provide Capital Facilities
to new EDUs for each Category of Necessary Public Services in each Service Area
as determined pursuant to Subsection (9) of this Section into the number of new
EDUs projected for that Service Area over a period not to exceed ten (10)
years, considering the specific EDU factor(s) associated with such EDUs for
each Category of Necessary Public Services.
         b.   Subtracting the required Offset per EDU calculated pursuant to
Subsection (11) of this Section.
   B.   Multiple Plans. An Infrastructure Improvements Plan adopted pursuant to
this Subsection may address one (1) or more of the Town’s Categories of
Necessary Public Services in any or all of the Town’s Service Areas. Each
Capital Facility shall be subject to no more than 1 Infrastructure Improvements
Plan at any given time.
   C.   Reserved Capacity. The Town may reserve capacity in an Infrastructure
Improvements Plan to serve 1 or more planned future developments, including
capacity reserved through a Development Agreement pursuant to Section
7-11-130 of this Article. All reservations of existing capacity must be
disclosed in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan at the time it is adopted.

      4.   The development fee schedules in the Fee Report adopted pursuant to
this Subsection shall become effective seventy-five (75) days after adoption of
the Fee Report by the Town.
(Ord. No. 764, Enacted, 01/12/12)
7-11-100   Timing for the Renewal and Updating of the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and the Land Use Assumptions.
   A.   Renewing the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. Except as provided in
Subsection (B) of this Section, not later than every five (5) years the Town

(Ord. No. 764, Enacted, 01/12/12)
7-11-110   Collection of Development Impact Fees.
   A.   Collection. Development impact fees, together with administrative
charges assessed pursuant to Subsection (A)(6) of this Section, shall be
calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence
development; specifically:
      1.   Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a Development Agreement
adopted pursuant to
7-11-130 of this Article, development impact fees shall be paid prior to
issuance of a building permit according to the current development impact fee
schedule for the applicable Service Area(s) as adopted pursuant to this
Article, or according to any other development impact fee schedule as
authorized in this Article.
      2.   If a building permit is not required for the development, but water
or wastewater connections are required, any and all development impact fees due
shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased. If only a
wastewater connection is required, the development impact fees shall be paid
prior to approval of a connection to the sewer system.
      3.   If the development is located in a Service Area with a Storm Water,
Drainage, and Flood Control development impact fee, and neither a building
permit, water, or sewer service connection is required, the Storm Drainage
development impact fee due shall be paid at the time a civil or site permit is
issued for the development.
      4.   No building permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of
occupancy shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed
in the previous Subsections.
      5.   If the building permit is for a change in the type of building use,
an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a
residential or non-residential point of demand to the water or wastewater
system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service
units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development
impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type.
      6.   For issued permits that expire or are voided, development impact
fees and administrative charges shall be as follows:
         a.   If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or
voided permit, and the development impact fees paid for such development have
not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any
development impact fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the
fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed.
         b.   If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being
sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit Applicant
shall pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in
effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original
permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit
Applicant, the new permit Applicant shall pay development impact fees as if it
were the original permittee.
   B.   Exceptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either of
the following conditions:
      1.   Development impact fees have been paid for the development and the
permit(s) which triggered the collection of the development impact fees have
not expired or been voided.
      2.   The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development impact
fees involve modifications to existing residential or non-residential
development that do not: (a) add new EDUs, (b) increase the impact of existing
EDUs on existing or future Capital Facilities, or (c) change the land-use type
of the existing development to a different category of development for which a
higher development impact fee would have been due. To the extent that any
modification does not meet the requirements of this Subsection, the development
impact fee due shall be the difference between the development impact fee that
was or would have been due on the existing development and the development
impact fee that is due on the development as modified.
   C.   Temporary Exemptions from Development Impact Fee Schedules. New
developments in the Town shall be temporarily exempt from increases in
development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or modified
development impact fee schedules as follows:
      1.   Residential Uses. On or after the day that the first building permit
is issued for a single-family residential development, the Town shall, at the
permittee’s request, provide the permittee with an applicable development
impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of twenty-four (24)
months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which
shall expire at the end of the first business day of the twenty-fifth (25 th )
month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development
impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same single-family
residential development shall not be subject to any new or modified development
impact fee schedule.
      2.   Commercial, Industrial and Multifamily Uses. On or after the day
that the final approval, as defined in A.R.S. § 9-463.05(T)(4), is issued for a
retail, commercial/office, industrial or multifamily development, the Town
shall provide an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in
force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that final development
approval of a site plan or final subdivision plat is given, and which shall
expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter.
During the effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule,
any building permit issued for the same development shall not be subject to any
new or modified development impact fee schedule.
      3.   Other Development. Any Category of Development not covered under
Subsections (1) and (2) of this Subsection shall pay development impact fees
according to the fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as
specified in Subsection (A) of this Section.
      4.   Changes to Site Plans and Subdivision Plats. Notwithstanding the
other requirements of this Subsection, if changes are made to a development’s
final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service
units after the issuance of a grandfathered development impact fee schedule,
the Town may assess any new or modified development impact fees against the
additional service units. If the Town reduces the amount of an applicable
development impact fee during the period that a grandfathered development
impact fee schedule is in force, the Town shall assess the lower development
impact fee.
   D.    Option to Pursue Special Fee Determination. Where a development is of
a type that does not closely fit within a particular Category of Development
appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development
has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated
with providing Necessary Public Services to that development will differ
substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified
Category of Development, the Town may require the Applicant to provide the Town
Development Services Director or authorized designee with an alternative
development impact fee analysis. Based on a projection of the actual burdens
and costs that will be associated with the development, the alternative
development impact fee analysis may propose a unique fee for the development
based on the application of an appropriate EDU factor to the applicable Plan-
Based Cost per EDU, or may propose that the development be covered under the
development impact fee schedule governing a different and more analogous
Category of Development. The Town Development Services Director or authorized
designee shall review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall make a
determination as to the development impact fee to be charged. Such decision
shall be appealable pursuant to Section
7-11-140 of this Article. The Town Development Services Director or authorized
designee may require the Applicant to pay an administrative fee to cover the
actual costs of reviewing the special fee determination application.
(Ord. No. 764, Enacted, 01/12/12; Ord. No. 894, Amended, 01/13/22)
7-11-120   Development Impact Fee Credits and Credit Agreements.
   A.   Eligibility of Capital Facility. All development impact fee Credits
must meet the following requirements:
      1.   One (1) of the following is true:
         a.   The Capital Facility, or the financial contribution toward a
Capital Facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a Credit
will be issued, must be identified in an adopted Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and Fee Report as a Capital Facility for which a development impact fee
was assessed; or
         b.   The Applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Town
that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject Capital Facility
should have been included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan in lieu of a
different Capital Facility that was included in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject
Capital Facility is determined to be eligible for a Credit in this manner, the
Town shall amend the Infrastructure Improvements Plan to (i) include the
subject replacement facility and (ii) delete the Capital Facility that will be
replaced.
      2.   Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a
developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by
the Town through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the
developer will be paid or reimbursed by the Town for any contribution, payment,
construction, or dedication from any Town funding source including an agreement
to reimburse the developer with future collected development impact fees
pursuant to Section
7-11-130 of this Article, any Credits claimed by the developer shall be: (a)
deducted from any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the Town; or (b) reduced
by the amount of such payment or reimbursement.
   B.   Eligibility of Subject Development. To be eligible for a Credit, the
Subject Development must be located within the Service Area of the eligible
Capital Facility.
   C.   Calculation of Credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the
costs for an eligible Capital Facility identified in the adopted Infrastructure
Improvements Plan for which a development fee was assessed pursuant to the Fee
Report. If the Gross Impact Fee for a particular category of Necessary Public
Service is adopted at an amount lower than the Plan-Based Cost per EDU, the
amount of any Credit shall be reduced in proportion to the difference between
the Plan-Based Cost per EDU and the Gross Impact Fee adopted. A Credit shall
not exceed the actual costs the Applicant incurred in providing the eligible
Capital Facility.
   D.   Allocation of Credits. Before any Credit can be issued to a Subject
Development (or portion thereof), the Credit must be allocated to that
development as follows:
      1.   The Developer and the Town must execute a Credit Agreement including
all of the following:
         a.   The total amount of the Credits resulting from provision of an
eligible Capital Facility.
         b.   The estimated number of EDUs to be served within the Subject
Development.
         c.   The method by which the Credit values will be distributed within
the Subject Development.
      2.   It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of
development impact fee Credits through an application for a Credit Agreement
(which may be part of a Development Agreement entered into pursuant to Section
7-11-130 of this Article).
      3.   If a building permit is issued or a water/sewer connection is
purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a Credit
Agreement for the Subject Development, no Credits may be allocated
retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any
remaining permits for the Subject Development in accordance with this Article.
      4.   If the entity that provides an eligible Capital Facility sells or
relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior
to execution of a Credit Agreement or Development Agreement, Credits resulting
from the eligible Capital Facility will only be allocated to the development if
the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor(s)
in interest for the Subject Development.
      5.   If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible Capital Facility,
both entities must enter into a single Credit Agreement with the Town, and any
request for the allocation of Credit within the Subject Development(s) must be
made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible Capital Facility.
      6.   Credits may only be reallocated from or within a Subject Development
with the Town’s approval of an amendment to an executed Credit Agreement,
subject to the following conditions:
         a.   The entity that executed the original agreement with the Town, or
its legal successor in interest and the entity that currently controls the
Subject Development are parties to the request for reallocation.
         b.   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
Credits already issued for the Subject Development.
      7.   A Credit Agreement may authorize the allocation of Credits to a non-
contiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met:
         a.   The entity that executed the original agreement with the Town or
its legal successor in interest, the entity that currently controls the Subject
Development, and the entity that controls the non-contiguous parcel are parties
to the request for reallocation.
         b.   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
Credits already issued for the Subject Development.
         c.   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same Service Area as that
served by the eligible Capital Facility.
         d.   The non-contiguous parcel receives a Necessary Public Service
from the eligible Capital Facility.
         e.   The Credit Agreement specifically states the value of the Credits
to be allocated to each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a mechanism for
future determination of the Credit values.
         f.   The Credit Agreement does not involve the transfer of Credits to
or from any property subject to a Development Agreement.
   E.   Credit Agreement. Credits shall only be issued pursuant to a Credit
Agreement executed in accordance with Subsection (D) of this Section. The Town
Manager or Authorized Designee is authorized by this Article to enter into a
Credit Agreement with the controlling entity of a Subject Development, subject
to the following:
      1.   The Developer requesting the Credit Agreement shall provide all
information requested by the Town to allow it to determine the value of the
Credit to be applied.
      2.   An application for a Credit Agreement shall be submitted to the Town
by the Developer within one (1) year of the date on which ownership or control
of the Capital Facility passes to the Town.
      3.   The Developer shall submit a draft Credit Agreement to the Town
Manager or authorized designee(s) for review in the form provided to the
Applicant by the Town. The draft Credit Agreement shall include, at a minimum,
all of the following information and supporting documentation:
         a.   A legal description and map depicting the location of the Subject
Development for which Credit is being applied. The map shall depict the
location of the Capital Facilities that have been or will be provided.
         b.   An estimate of the total EDUs that will be developed within the
Subject Development depicted on the map and described in the legal description.
         c.   A list of the Capital Facilities, associated physical attributes,
and the related costs as stated in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
         d.   Documentation showing the date(s) of acceptance by the Town, if
the Capital Facilities have already been provided.
         e.   The total amount of Credit to be applied within the Subject
Development and the calculations leading to the total amount of Credit.
         f.   The Credit amount to be applied to each EDU within the Subject
Development for each Category of Necessary Public Services.
      4.   The Credit Agreement shall be approved by the Town Council prior to
its execution. The Town’s determination of the Credit to be allocated is final.
      5.   Upon execution of the Credit Agreement by the Town and the
Applicant, Credits shall be deemed allocated to the Subject Development.
      6.   Any amendment to a previously approved Credit Agreement must be
initiated within two (2) years of the Town’s final acceptance of the eligible
Capital Facility for which the amendment is requested.
      7.   Any Credit Agreement approved as part of a Development Agreement
shall be amended in accordance with the terms of the Development Agreement and
Section
7-11-130 of this Article.
   F.   Issuance of Credits. Credits allocated pursuant to Subsection (D) of
this Section may be issued and applied toward the Gross Impact Fees due from a
development, subject to the following conditions:
      1.   Credits issued for an eligible Capital Facility may only be applied
to the development impact fee due for the applicable Category of Necessary
Public Services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another Category of
Necessary Public Services.
      2.   Credits shall only be issued when the eligible Capital Facility from
which the Credits were derived has been accepted by the Town or when adequate
security for the completion of the eligible Capital Facility has been provided
in accordance with all terms of an executed Development Agreement.
      3.   Where Credits have been issued pursuant to Subsection (2) of this
Subsection, an impact fee due at the time a building permit is issued shall be
reduced by the Credit amount stated in or calculated from the executed Credit
Agreement. Where Credits have not yet been issued, the Gross Impact Fee shall
be paid in full, and a refund of the Credit amount shall be due when the
Developer demonstrates compliance with Subsection (2) of this Subsection in a
written request to the Town.
      4.   Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to another
permit or parcel, except that Credits may be released for reuse on the same
Subject Development if a building permit for which the Credits were issued has
expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a refund under Section
7-11-150(A)(2)(a) of this Article.
      5.   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section
7-11-120, Credits issued prior to January 1, 2012 may only be used for the
Subject Development for which they were issued. Such Credits may be transferred
to a new owner of all or part of the Subject Development in proportion to the
percentage of ownership in the Subject Development to be held by the new owner.
(Ord. No. 764, Enacted, 01/12/12)
7-11-130   Development Agreements.
Development Agreements containing provisions regarding development impact fees,
development impact fee Credits, and/or disbursement of revenues from
development impact fee accounts shall comply with the following:
   A.   Development Agreement Required. A Development Agreement is required to
authorize any of the following:
      1.   To issue Credits prior to the Town’s acceptance of an eligible
Capital Facility.
      2.   To allocate Credits to a parcel that is not contiguous with the
Subject Development and that does not meet the requirements of Section
7-11-120(D)(7) of this Article.
      3.   To reimburse the developer of an eligible Capital Facility using
funds from development impact fee accounts.
      4.   To allocate different Credit amounts per EDU to different parcels
within a Subject Development.
      5.   For a single family residential Dwelling Unit, to allow development
impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit
as provided in this Section.
   B.   General Requirements. All Development Agreements shall be prepared and
executed in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and any applicable requirements
of the Town Code. Except where specifically modified by this Section, all
provisions of Section
7-11-120 of this Article shall apply to any Credit Agreement that is authorized
as part of a Development Agreement.
   C.   Early Credit Issuance. A Development Agreement may authorize the
issuance of Credits prior to acceptance of an eligible Capital Facility by the
Town when the Development Agreement specifically states the form and value of
the security (i.e. bond, letter of Credit, etc.) to be provided to the Town
prior to issuance of any Credits. The Town shall determine the acceptable form
and value of the security to be provided.
   D.   Non-Contiguous Credit Allocation. A Development Agreement may authorize
the allocation of Credits to a non-contiguous parcel only if all of the
following conditions are met:
      1.   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same Service Area as that served
by the eligible Capital Facility.
      2.   The non-contiguous parcel receives a Necessary Public Service from
the eligible Capital Facility.
      3.   The Development Agreement specifically states the value of the
Credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a mechanism
for future determination of the Credit values.
   E.   Uneven Credit Allocation. The Development Agreement must specify how
Credits will be allocated amongst different parcels on a per-EDU basis, if the
Credits are not to be allocated evenly. If the Development Agreement is silent
on this topic, all Credits will be allocated evenly amongst all parcels on a
per-EDU basis.
   F.   Use of Reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from impact fee
accounts for construction of an eligible Capital Facility must be utilized in
accordance with applicable law for the use of Town funds in construction or
acquisition of Capital Facilities, including A.R.S. § 34-201 et seq.
   G.   Deferral of Fees. A Development Agreement may provide for the deferral
of payment of development impact fees for a residential development beyond the
issuance of a building permit; provided that a development impact fee may not
be paid later than the fifteen (15) days after the issuance of the certificate
of occupancy for that Dwelling Unit. The Development Agreement shall provide
for the value of any deferred development impact fees to be supported by
appropriate security, including a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash bond.
   H.   Waiver of Fees. If the Town agrees to waive any development impact fees
assessed on development in a Development Agreement, the Town shall reimburse
the appropriate development impact fee account for the amount that was waived
and shall provide notice of the waiver to the Advisory Committee within thirty
(30) days.
   I.   No Obligation. Nothing in this Section obligates the Town to enter into
any Development Agreement or to authorize any type of Credit Agreement
permitted by this Section.

(Ord. No. 764, Enacted, 01/12/12; Ord. No. 894, Amended, 01/13/22)
7-11-150   Refunds of Development Impact Fees.
   A.   Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current owner
of property within the Town who submits a written request to the Town and
demonstrates that:
      1.   The permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development
impact fee have expired or been voided prior to the commencement of the
development for which the permits were issued and the development impact fees
collected have not been expended, encumbered, or Pledged for the repayment of
Financing or Debt; or
      2.    The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in
interest paid a development impact fee for the applicable Capital Facility on
or after August 1, 2014, and one (1) of the following conditions exists:
         a.   The Capital Facility designed to serve the subject real property
has been constructed, has the capacity to serve the subject real property and
any development for which there is reserved capacity, and the service which was
to be provided by that Capital Facility has not been provided to the subject
real property from that Capital Facility or from any other infrastructure.
         b.   After collecting the fee to construct a Capital Facility the Town
fails to complete construction of the Capital Facility within the time period
identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, as it may be amended, and
the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject real property
from that Capital Facility or any other infrastructure.
         c.   For a Category of Necessary Public Services, any part of a
development impact fee is not spent within ten (10) years of the Town’s receipt
of the development impact fee.
         d.   The development impact fee was calculated and collected for the
construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific Capital Facility
serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the
Capital Facility are less than the construction costs projected in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan by a factor of ten percent (10%) or more. In
such event, the current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request
as set forth in this Subsection (A), be entitled to a refund for the difference
between the amounts of the development impact fee charged for and attributable
to such construction cost and the amount the development impact fee would have
been calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the
Fee Report. The refund contemplated by this Subsection shall relate only to the
costs specific to the construction of the applicable Capital Facility and shall
not include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly
incurred for construction of the Capital Facility that are included in the
development impact fee as permitted by A.R.S. 9-463.05.
   B.   Earned Interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include any
interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development impact fee
by the Town from the date of collection to the date of refund. All refunds
shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is
paid.
   C.   Refund to Government. If a development impact fee was paid by a
governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity.

limitation the failure or refusal to make any return required by

penalty and interest when due.
      3.   Failure to provide complete and accurate information on the
applications required by this Chapter.

business in the state.
   B.   A notice of the refusal to issue or renew a license or the revocation
of an existing license shall be in writing and delivered or mailed to the
applicant(s) and licensee(s), specifying the nature of the violation(s). Notice
shall be delivered or mailed to the address of the applicant(s), licensee(s),
or statutory agent(s), as shown on the current business license application.
The giving of notice shall be completed upon the date of mailing or delivery.
Notice of revocation shall be given at least thirty (30) days before the
revocation is to take effect. Such written notice may be prepared and signed by
any Town official designated by the Town Manager to perform such duties.
   C.   A revocation notice arising from a violation of the provisions of this
Article shall be void in the event the licensee(s) corrects the violation and
complies with the requirements of this Article prior to the expiration of the
thirty (30) day notice period. If the licensee(s) fails to correct the noticed
violation within the thirty (30) day notice period, the license shall be
permanently revoked. The failure of the licensee(s) to correct a noticed
violation, resulting in the permanent revocation of a business license, may
constitute grounds for refusal to issue a new business license to the offending

in proper operating condition. Any remodeling or modification of building
structures or contents not approved by authorized fire, building, zoning,
health and safety personnel, and which may cause safety or code violations to
exist, is grounds for suspension or revocation of any license issued pursuant
to this Article. If the building structures or contents of a business licensed
under this Article are found to be faulty, unsafe or inoperable, the Town may
suspend the applicable license, and any violation occurring after issuance of
the business license must be corrected. Thereafter, the premises must be re-
inspected and approved (or evidence of re- inspection and approval must be
provided) before any reopening of the business shall occur. To continue
business to the public or as a private operation while such known violations
exist may result in immediate revocation of any license issued pursuant to this
Article without prior notice. A revocation notice arising from a violation of
this Section shall be void, and the revoked license shall be promptly
reinstated, as soon as the licensee has received notice in writing from the
appropriate Town official indicating that the violation(s) has/have been cured,
removed or rectified.
   F.   It is unlawful for any person to continue to engage in or conduct any
business within the Town upon the revocation or non-renewal of that person’s

In the event a person violates this subsection, the Town Clerk may seek, in
addition to all remedies available in this Code, an injunction in the Yavapai
Superior Court enjoining the violator from engaging or continuing in business
within the Town until such person has complied with this Article.

to the Town shall be made quarterly, or as otherwise provided in the license,
by delivery of the same to the Town Manager. This payment shall be in addition

   B.   The Town shall have the right to inspect the licensee's records showing
the gross receipts from which its license payments are computed and the right
of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under this Article. No

(Ord. No. 12, Enacted, 08/16/79; Ord. No. 178, Rep&ReEn, 05/26/88)
8-03-100   Acceptance by Licensee.
   A.   Within thirty (30) days after the passage of the ordinance awarding a
license or granting renewal of a license, or within such extended period of
time as the Council in its discretion may authorize, the licensee shall file
with the Town Clerk its written acceptance, in a form satisfactory to the Town

the Town Clerk. The licensee shall have no rights, remedies or redress in the
premises unless and until the Council, by resolution, shall determine that such
acceptance be received or filed, and then upon such terms and conditions as the
Council may impose.
   C.   In any case and in any instance, all rights, remedies and redress in
these premises, which may or shall be available to the Town, shall at all times
be available to the Town, and shall be preserved and maintained and shall
continually exist in and to the Town, and shall not be in any manner or means
modified, abridged, altered, restricted or impaired by reason of any of these
premises or otherwise.

   B.   No privilege or exemption shall be granted under this Article except
those specifically prescribed herein.
   C.   Any privilege claimed under any such license by the licensee in any
street or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior lawful
occupancy of the streets or other public property.
   D.   Time shall be of the essence of any such license granted hereunder. The
licensee shall not be relieved of his obligation to comply promptly with any of
the provisions of this Article or by any failure of the Town to force strict
compliance.
   E.   Any right or power in, or duty imposed upon any officer, employee,
department or board of the Town shall be subject to transfer by the Town to any
other officer, employee, department or board of the Town.
   F.   The licensee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the Town for any
loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of
this Article or of any license issued hereunder or because of its lawful
enforcement.
   G.   The licensee shall be subject to all requirements of this Code, Town
ordinances, rules, regulations and specifications heretofore or hereafter
enacted or established.
   H.   The licensee shall be subject to all laws, rules and regulations of the
State, County, the Town and the United States government, and any of its
agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission,
whether such rule or regulation is in force or hereafter enacted, relating to
the business of cable television systems.
   I.   Any of the provisions or terms of this Article shall be automatically
amended and made consistent with any new or amended rule or regulation of the
Federal Communications Commission if such new or amended rule or regulation of
the Federal Communications Commission renders such provisions or terms
prohibited or inconsistent. The licensee shall then comply with such amendments
of this Article within a reasonable time as determined by the Council. Any
provision of this Article presently prohibited by the rules and regulations of
the Federal Communications Commission which is subsequently allowed by that
agency shall automatically have full force and effect, and the licensee shall
comply within a reasonable time as determined by the Council.
   J.   Any such license granted shall not relieve the licensee of any
obligation involved in obtaining the necessary pole or conduit space from any
department of the Town, utility company, or from others maintaining poles,
conduits or utilities in streets.
   K.   Any license granted hereunder shall be in lieu of any and all other
rights, privileges, powers, immunities and authorities owned, possessed,
controlled or exercisable by the licensee, or any successor to any interest of
the licensee of or pertaining to the construction, operation or maintenance of
any CATV system in the Town. The acceptance of any license hereunder shall
operate, as between the licensee and the Town, as an abandonment of any and all
of such rights, privileges, powers, immunities and authorities within the Town,
to the effect that, as between the licensee and the Town, any and all
construction, operation and maintenance by any licensee of any CATV system in
the Town shall be, and shall be deemed and construed in all instances and
respects to be under and pursuant to such license, and not under or pursuant to
any other right, privilege, power, immunity or authority whatsoever.
   L.   In addition to the payment to the Town described in Section 8-03-090,
the licensee shall be subject to any local tax now imposed or hereafter imposed
by the Town which is not unique to CATV operations.
   M.   The licensee's service and extension policies shall show no
preferential or discriminatory practices and shall be on file with the Town
Clerk.
   N.   Any such license shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by
the original licensee.
      1.   Such license cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased,
assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary
sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, without prior
consent of the Council expressed by resolution, and then only under such
conditions as may therein be prescribed. Any such transfer or assignment shall
be made only by an instrument in writing, a duly executed copy of which shall
be filed in the Office of the Town Clerk within thirty (30) days after any such
transfer or assignment. The consent of the Council may not be unreasonably
refused, provided however, that the proposed assignee must show financial
responsibility as determined by the Council and must agree to comply with all
provisions of this Article, and meet all of the qualifications that must be met
by an original licensee; and provided, further, that no such consent shall be
required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation, in whole or
in part, to secure an indebtedness. The granting, giving or waiving of any one
or more such consents shall not render unnecessary any subsequent consent or
consents.
      2.   In the event that the licensee is a corporation, prior approval of
the Council, expressed by ordinance shall be required where there is an actual
change in control or when ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
voting stock or ownership control, the licensee is acquired by a person or
group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own fifty percent
(50%) or more of the voting stock, singly or collectively. Any such acquisition
occurring without prior approval of the Council shall constitute a failure to
comply with a material provision of this Article within the meaning of Section
8-03-160.
      3.   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial
part of the CATV system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a
substantial part of the CATV system, the licensee shall notify the Council of
such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a
change in control of the licensee company has taken place, and the provisions
of paragraph 4 of this Subsection governing the consent of the Council to such
change in control of the licensee company shall apply.
      4.   Upon written notification by the licensee to the Town of a proposed
assignment of the license or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee
company, the Council shall direct the Town Manager to issue and the Town
Manager shall issue his written notice fixing and setting forth the day, hour
and place certain when and where any persons having any interest therein may
appear and be heard, and otherwise pursuant to the procedure set forth in
Section
8-03-050(C), give notice, conduct a hearing and report to the Council for a
determination of the status of the license and the necessary or recommended
action to be taken, if any.
(Ord. No. 12, Enacted, 08/16/79; Ord. No. 178, Rep&ReEn, 05/26/88)
8-03-120   Renewal.
   A.   Any license granted under this Article is renewable for a term not to
exceed fifteen (15) years upon application of the licensee and after full
public proceedings, in the same manner and upon the same terms and conditions
as required for obtaining the original license, except those which are by their
terms expressly inapplicable; provided, however, that the Council may, at its
option, waive compliance with any or all of the requirements in Section
8-03-080 which are not required in renewal proceedings by the Federal
Communications Commission.
   B.   The Council shall also consider, in renewing a license, the performance
of the licensee and the adequacy of the license.
   C.   Upon the cancellation or termination by the Council or upon expiration
of the license, the Council may, by resolution, direct the licensee to operate
the same for a period up to six (6) months under the terms and conditions of
this Article and at no expense to the Town.
   D.   An application fee for renewal shall be accompanied by a fee given and
accepted under the same terms and conditions, and of the same amount as the
application fee described in Section
8-03-080(E).
(Ord. No. 12, Enacted, 08/16/79; Ord. No. 178, Rep&ReEn, 05/26/88)

than fifteen (15) years following the date of issuance of such license.

8-03-140   Bond Required.
The licensee shall, concurrently with the filing of and acceptance of award of
any license granted under this Article, file with the Town Clerk and, at all
times thereafter, maintain in full force and effect for the term of such
license or any renewal thereof, at the licensee's sole expense, a surety bond
in a company and in a form approved by the Town Attorney, in an amount to be
determined by the Council not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
Such bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the licensee,
and upon the further condition that in the event the licensee shall fail to
comply with any one or more of the provisions of the Article or of any license
issued to the licensee hereunder, there shall be recoverable jointly and
severally from the principal and surety of such bond any damages or loss
suffered by the Town as a result thereof, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property
of the licensee as prescribed hereby which may be in default, plus a reasonable
allowance for attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond.
Such condition shall be a continuing obligation for the duration of such
license and any renewal thereof and thereafter until the licensee has
liquidated all of its obligations with the Town that may have arisen from the
acceptance of such license or renewal by the licensee or from its exercise of
any privilege therein granted. The bond shall provide that sixty (60) days'
prior written notice of intention not to renew, cancellation or material change
be given to the Town.

   A.   The licensee shall, concurrently with the filing of an acceptance of
award of any license granted under this Article, furnish to the Town and file

granted hereunder, maintain in full force and effect, a general comprehensive
liability insurance policy, in protection of the Town, its officers, boards,
commissions, agents and employees, in a company approved by the Town Manager
and in a form satisfactory to the Town Attorney, protecting the Town and all
persons against liability for loss or damage for personal injury, death and

   B.   The policies mentioned in Subsection A of this Section shall name the
Town, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees as additional
insureds and shall contain a provision that a written notice of cancellation or
reduction in coverage of such policy shall be delivered to the Town fifteen
(15) days in advance of the effective date thereof. If such insurance is
provided by a policy which also covers the licensee or any other entity or
person other than those above named, then such policy shall contain the
standard cross-liability endorsement.
   C.   The licensee shall, at the sole risk and expense of the licensee, upon
demand of the Town, made by and through the Town Attorney, appear in and defend
any and all suits, actions or other legal proceedings, whether judicial, quasi-
judicial, administrative, legislative or otherwise, brought or instituted or
had by third persons or duly constituted authorities, against or affecting the
Town, its officers, boards, commissions, agents or employees, and arising out
of or pertaining to the exercise or the enjoyment of such license, or the
granting thereof by the Town.
   D.   The licensee shall pay and satisfy and shall cause to be paid and
satisfied any judgment, decree, order, directive or demand rendered, made or
issued against the licensee, the Town, its officers, boards, commissions,
agents or employees in any of these premises. Such indemnity shall exist and
continue without reference to or limitation by the amount of any bond, policy
of insurance, deposit, undertaking or other assurance required hereunder, or
otherwise, provided that the licensee shall not make or enter into any
compromise or settlement of any claim, demand, cause of action, action, suit or
other proceeding, without first obtaining written consent of the Town.

of expiration by the Council in the event that the Council shall have found

termination of the license upon the next regular Council meeting agenda. The
Town Manager shall cause to be served upon such licensee, at least ten (10)
days prior to the date of such Council meeting, a written notice of his intent
to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of
which shall be published by the Town Clerk at least once ten (10) days before

direct the licensee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms
and conditions as are reasonable.

then the Council may, by resolution, declare that the license of such licensee
shall be terminated and forfeited unless there be compliance by the licensee
within such period as the Council may fix.
   F.   The termination and forfeiture of any license shall in no way affect
any of the rights of the Town under this Article, the license or any provision
of law.

8-05-140   Police Officer Hold on Property.
   A.   Whenever any peace officer has probable cause to believe that property
in the possession of a dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction house is
stolen, the peace officer may place a hold on the property for a period not to
exceed ten (10) days. The hold shall be effective immediately upon oral or
written notice. If the hold is placed orally, it shall be followed by a written
notice mailed to the dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction house
within two days, excluding weekends and Town holidays. The written notice of
hold shall accurately describe the property, providing the item's brand name
and serial number, if applicable. During the hold period the dealer of used
articles, junk dealer or auction house shall not release or dispose of the
property, except pursuant to a court order or upon receipt of a written
authorization signed by any peace officer who is a member of the law
enforcement agency of which the peace officer placing the hold on the property
is a member. At the time of receipt of the written hold, the dealer of used
articles, junk dealer or auction house shall tag and mark the item placed on
hold with the following information: date and time of hold, name of law
enforcement agency placing the hold, and law enforcement report number. A
dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction house shall not be subject to
civil liability for compliance with this section.
   B.   Whenever property that is in the possession of a dealer of used
articles, junk dealer or auction house is subject to a hold and the property is
required by a peace officer in a criminal investigation, the dealer of used
articles, junk dealer or auction house, upon reasonable notice, shall produce
the property at reasonable times and places or may deliver the property to any
peace officer upon the request of any peace officer who is a member of the law
enforcement agency or which the peace officer placing the hold on the property
is a member.
   C.   Whenever property that is in the possession of a dealer of used
articles, junk dealer or auction house is subject to a hold and the property is
no longer required for the purpose of criminal investigation, the law
enforcement agency that placed the hold on the property shall undertake the
following:
      1.   With respect to the property being held, if the law enforcement
agency no longer has probable cause to believe that the property on hold is
stolen, the hold shall be released.
      2.   If the law enforcement agency has knowledge that property has been
reported stolen, the law enforcement agency may give written notification to
the person who reported the stolen property of the name and address of the
dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction house holding the property, and
may authorize the release of the property to that person and advise the person
that the law neither requires nor prohibits payment of a fee or any other
condition in return for the surrender of the property. A copy of the notice
with the address of the claimant deleted shall be mailed to the dealer of used
articles, junk dealer or auction house in possession of the property. The
person who reported the stolen property shall present a police hold release to
the dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction house prior to the person
receiving the item. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the alleged owner does
not choose to participate in the prosecution of an identified alleged thief,
the alleged owner shall pay the dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction
house the "out of pocket" expenses paid in the acquisition of the allegedly
stolen property in return for the surrender of the property. If no action is
taken to recover the property by the person who reported the property stolen
within sixty days after the date that the notice was mailed, or if the property
was not placed on hold, sixty days after a law enforcement officer advised the
dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction house that the property may be
stolen property, the dealer of used articles, junk dealer or auction house in
possession of the property may treat the property as regularly acquired in the

9-04-020   Owner, Lessee or Occupant to Maintain Property.
   A.   The owner, lessee or occupant of any property shall at all times remove
rubbish (including other accumulations of filth, related debris, and
dilapidated buildings) that constitute a hazard to public health and safety
from said property, maintain said property in a clean and safe condition, and
otherwise avoid keeping or maintaining any nuisance thereon. These requirements
also apply to appurtenant, adjacent or contiguous sidewalks, alleys and
portions of streets that are not hard-surfaced for vehicular traffic.
   B.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the owner, lessee or
occupant of any property shall have the following specific obligations and
responsibilities on the property and appurtenant, adjacent or contiguous
sidewalks, alleys and portions of streets that are not hard-surfaced for
vehicular traffic:
      1.   To control weeds and yard waste thereon and otherwise maintain said
areas free of dry bushes, trees, tumbleweeds, weeds or other dry vegetation
that create a visual blight upon the neighborhood, harbor insect or rodent
infestations, become a fire hazard, or otherwise threaten the health, safety or
economic welfare of adjacent property owners or occupants. In so doing, the
owner, lessee or occupant shall not allow grass or weeds to exceed twelve (12)
inches in height and shall otherwise maintain the property in a manner that
prevents weeds or yard waste from being carried or deposited by the elements
upon any public place.
      2.   To keep ditches or similar watercourses that are part of the storm
drainage system clean and free of rubbish (expressly including vegetation, yard
waste, and debris) that would obstruct the easy and natural flow of water
therein.
      3.   To maintain all installed landscaping and irrigation systems in
accordance with Site Development Standards set forth in Article 13-26 of this
Code.
      4.   To keep the portion of any sidewalk immediately adjacent to the
property clean and free of snow and ice (including any that accumulates from
passing snow plows and other traffic).
      5.   To refrain from keeping or maintaining any other nuisance thereon in
a manner that causes substantial diminution to the value of other property in
the neighborhood. In this regard, accumulations of personal property on
property as part of a yard sale are not a nuisance as defined herein if, and
only if:
         a.   The personal property consists of surplus household property
(regardless of ownership).
         b.   The personal property is publicly offered for sale.
         c.   The personal property is neatly displayed for sale (either within
or without any premises).
         d.   The personal property is neatly secured within premises during
those periods when it is not offered for sale.
         e.   The personal property is offered for sale over a period not
longer than three (3) consecutive calendar days.
For the purposes of this yard sale exception, personal property is offered for
sale through any method of informing or soliciting buyers of goods, including
(but not limited to) use of signs, handbills, newspaper advertisements, and
direct personal contacts. However, nothing in this Subsection shall permit
placement of rubbish or posting of signs on public property (including utility
poles), or improper disposal of hazardous materials otherwise prohibited in
this Code.
   C.   Beyond the access to property and removal of storm water provided by
adjacent sidewalks, alleys, and portions of streets that are not hard-surfaced
for vehicular traffic, nothing herein shall give the owner, lessee or occupant
of any property abutting any such area any special or exclusive right of use of
or control over such area. Moreover, nothing herein shall exclude the Town from
conducting in its sole discretion activities to maintain, repair, replace, or
build drainage structures in or hard-surface for vehicular travel any portion
of said sidewalks, alleys, and portions of streets that are not yet hard-
surfaced for vehicular traffic (expressly including removal of any lining
placed in ditches by property owners, lessees or occupants to suppress
vegetation). Nor shall anything herein impose on the Town any liability for
such activities.

No person shall (with or without permission) place rubbish (including trash,
garbage or related debris), appliances and vehicles, building material, soil &
concrete, brush and other yard waste, sewage, or any other dangerous byproduct
or waste, snow or ice on property not owned, leased or otherwise controlled by
that person (including, but not limited to, any public place). The sole
exception to this prohibition is placement (with permission) of such rubbish
and other materials on property that has been zoned and otherwise permitted for
disposal and storage of such items. Owners, lessees or occupants of property
shall use and maintain authorized private receptacles for collection in such a
manner that rubbish (including related debris) shall not be carried or
deposited by the elements upon any adjacent property (including, but not
limited to, any public place).

9-04-080   Assessment for Abatement.
   A.   Upon completion of the work, the Town Manager shall prepare a verified
statement of account of the actual cost of the removal, abatement, or
injunction (including the legal costs associated therewith and the actual cost
of additional inspections and incidental connected costs), the name and address
of the Town as the party imposing the assessment, the date the work was
completed, and the street address and the legal description of the property on
which said work was done, and shall serve a duplicate copy of such verified
statement upon the owner and upon the lessee or occupant in the manner
prescribed in Section
9-04-050.
   B.   The owner and the lessee or occupant shall have thirty (30) days from
the date the verified statement is served or mailed to pay the assessment or to
appeal in writing to the Town Council about the amount of the assessment. If an
appeal is not filed with the Town Council within such thirty (30) day period,
then the amount of the assessment as determined by the Manager shall become
final. If an appeal is taken, the Town Council shall, at its next regular
meeting, hear and determine the appeal and may affirm the amount of the
assessment, modify the amount thereof or determine that no assessment at all
shall be made. Upon affirmation or modification of the amount by the Council,
the owner and the lessee or occupant shall have five (5) days to pay the
assessment to the Town.
   C.   If no appeal is taken from the amount of the assessment or if an appeal
is taken and the Council has affirmed or modified the amount of the assessment,
and the assessment is not paid within the time specified:
      1.   Owner-occupied property or residential property of more than four
(4) units - the original assessment or the assessment as so modified shall be
recorded in the office of the County Recorder. Any assessment recorded after
July 15, 1996, is prior and superior to all other liens, obligations,
mortgages, or other encumbrances, except liens for general taxes.
      2.   Tenant-occupied Property - for residential properties of 4 or fewer
units, if a property is serving as a rental and is occupied by a tenant during
the time of the abatement, the Neighborhood Services Director, or designee,
will petition a court of competent jurisdiction for an order of judgment
against the tenant in the amount of the assessment.
   D.   A sale of the property to satisfy an assessment obtained under the
provisions of this Section shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure or order
of sale. The Town shall have the right to bring an action to enforce the
assessment in the Superior Court at any time after the recording of the
assessment, but failure to enforce the assessment by such action shall not
affect its validity. The recorded assessment shall be prima facie evidence of
the truth of all matters recited therein and of the regularity of all
proceedings prior to the recording thereof.
   E.   Assessments that are imposed under this Section
9-04-080 run against the property until paid and are due and payable in equal
annual installments as follows:
      1.   Assessments of less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be
paid within one (1) year after the assessment is recorded.
      2.   Assessments of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more but less than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) shall be paid within two (2) years after the
assessment is recorded.
       3.   Assessments of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more but less
than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) shall be paid within three (3) years
after the assessment is recorded.
      4.   Assessments of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more but less
than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) shall be paid within six (6) years after
the assessment is recorded.
      5.   Assessments of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more shall be
paid within ten (10) years after the assessment is recorded.
   F.    An assessment that is past due accrues interest at the rate prescribed
by ARS 44-1201.
   G.   A prior assessment for the purposes provided in this Section shall not
be a bar to subsequent assessment or assessments for these purposes, and any
number of assessments on the same tract of land may be enforced in the same
action.

To store or to permit the storage of any junked motor vehicle on any private
property within the Town in violation of this Article is hereby declared
dangerous to the public safety and a public nuisance. It is further declared
that such storage interferes with the enjoyment of property; reduces the value
of private property; invites plundering; creates fire hazards; extends and
aggravates urban blight and deterioration; represents a hazard to the health
and safety of minors; attracts rodents and insects; and poses a serious danger
to the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, welfare and happiness. Any
junked motor vehicle located upon private property in violation hereof, wherein
the owner of the vehicle is also the owner or person in control of the property
upon which it is located, shall be considered a prima facie case of such a
nuisance.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-040   Prohibited Storage.

within the Town, except as permitted by Section
9-04a-050 of this Article.

to store any junked motor vehicle or to permit such vehicle to remain on the

9-04a-050   Permitted Storage.
This Article shall not apply to any junked motor vehicle stored on private
property within the Town, if the vehicle is:
   A.   So stored as part of a lawful and properly licensed business
enterprise, operated in a proper zoning district and in compliance with the
applicable zoning standards, either as a primary or an accessory use; or
   B.   So stored for future restoration, completely within a "structure" as
defined in this Article.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-060   Right of Entry.
The Chief of Police or any police officer, a Town authorized certified

9-04a-070   Notice to Abate.

owner of the vehicle if known, that:
   A.   The junked motor vehicle constitutes a public nuisance under the
provisions of this Article; and
   B.   The public nuisance must be abated in accordance with the provisions of
Section
9-04a-090 herein within ten (10) calendar days;

(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-080   Service of Notice.
Any such notice shall be deemed to be properly served when a copy thereof is
delivered to the owner pursuant to Rules 4, 4.1, and 4.2 of the Arizona Rules
of Civil Procedure, by certified mail with return- receipt requested to the
owner's last known address, or, if the certified letter is returned with the
receipt showing that it has not been delivered, by posting a copy thereof upon
the junked motor vehicle. If the registered owner of a vehicle cannot be
determined in that there is not a license plate, registration or vehicle
identification number or other method to determine ownership of the vehicle,
service of notice to the vehicle owner is considered waived, and the Town may
immediately proceed without notice to the vehicle owner.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-090   Duty of Owner after Notice.
The owner of a junked motor vehicle or the owner or occupant of the property
upon which it is located shall (unless said owner or occupant appeals the
notice pursuant to Section
9-04a-100 herein), within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice as
provided in Sections
9-04a-070 and
9-04a-080 herein:
   A.   Lawfully register the vehicle and affix thereto unexpired number or
license plates assigned to the vehicle by any state and repair any and all
conditions set forth in Subsection
9-04a-020(A) which cause such vehicle to be a public nuisance;
   B.   Remove the vehicle or cause to have the vehicle removed to an
authorized salvage yard or to any other location, provided the same complies
with all applicable provisions of the Town Code; or
   C.   Lawfully store the vehicle pursuant to Section
9-04a-050 herein.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-100   Review.
   A.   Request for Public Hearing.
      1.   Upon receipt of a notice of public nuisance from the authorized Town
official, the owner of the vehicle or the owner or the lawful controller of the
real property upon which the vehicle is located may file a written request with
the Town Manager for a public hearing before the Board of Adjustment. Said
request must be filed with the Manager within ten (10) calendar days after the
mailing or service of the notice of public nuisance. The Board shall hold such
a hearing within a reasonable period thereafter and shall there determine
whether a nuisance exists and the appropriate manner of eliminating any
nuisance. No abatement or other enforcement action shall be taken during the
pendency of the appeal unless the nuisance constitutes a significant hazard to
life or property.
      2.   Notice of the hearing shall be mailed via certified mail in
accordance with Section 13-29-060 of this Code to the owner of the vehicle and/
or the owner or lawful controller of the real property on which the vehicle is
located, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers
are not available to determine ownership (in which case notice to the vehicle
owner is considered waived).
      3.   If such a request for a public hearing is not received within the
ten (10) days after serving the notice of public nuisance, the Town shall have
authority to abate the nuisance by removing the vehicle(s) giving rise to the
public nuisance without such a hearing being held.
   B.   Hearing Procedure. The Board of Adjustment shall hold any such public
hearing pursuant to the requirements of Section 13-29-060. In so doing, it
shall hear all facts and testimony related to the appeal that it deems
necessary. Facts and testimony may include testimony on the actual condition of
the vehicle and the circumstances surrounding the vehicle's present location
and condition. The Board shall not be limited by the technical rules of
evidence. The owner of the vehicle and/or the owner or occupant of the real
property on which the junked motor vehicle is located may appear in person and
present relevant evidence or testimony on these issues. Other interested third
parties may also present relevant evidence or testimony, at the discretion of
the Board.
   C.   Board Decision.
      1.   The Board may impose such conditions and take such actions as it
deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purposes of this
Article. For example, it may find that a particular vehicle is a public
nuisance and order the vehicle removed from the property on which it is
located, and disposed of as provided in this Article. The Board may also
determine that other remedies should be pursued by the Town, either in concert
with abatement or separately. On the other hand, the Board may determine that
removal of the vehicle or pursuit of other remedies is presently unjustified.
      2.   The owner of the vehicle and/or the owner or lawful occupant of the
real property, or any other interested party who makes a presentation to the
Board at such a hearing, shall be notified in writing of the Board's decision.
Any such decision shall be final.
   D.   Order of Removal. In the event that the Board determines, after
hearing, that a junked motor vehicle must be removed from the property, said
vehicle may be removed ten (10) calendar days after mailing of the written
decision to the appropriate parties, and disposed of pursuant to Article 3,
Chapter 11, Title 28 of the Arizona Revised Statutes.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-110   Abatement; Criminal and Civil Enforcement.
   A.   Failure of the owner of a junked motor vehicle and/or the owner or
occupant of the real property on which the junked motor vehicle is located to
abate the nuisance as set forth herein, shall empower the authorized Town
enforcement officials to remove such vehicles or cause them to be removed
according to Subsection
9-04a-090(B) of this Code and disposed of pursuant to ARS 28-4801 et seq., at
the expense of the owner of the vehicle and/or the owner or occupant of the
real property.
   B.   Failure of the owner of a junked motor vehicle and/or the owner or
occupant of the real property on which the junked motor vehicle is located to
abate the nuisance as set forth herein, shall also empower the authorized Town
enforcement officials to (a) issue a criminal complaint against the owner of
the vehicle, the owner or occupant of the real property on which the vehicle is
located, or both, (b) issue an appropriate civil complaint seeking to enjoin
continuation of the public nuisance and, where possible, to collect damages,
and (c) issue a civil citation in accordance with
Article 1-08 of this Code.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-120   Assessment of Costs.
   A.   In addition to any procedures for obtaining reimbursement for the costs
of abating the public nuisance found in Article 2, Chapter 11, Title 28 of the
Arizona Revised Statutes, the Town may receive reimbursement of abatement costs
from the owner or occupant of the real property on which the vehicle was
located. In pursuit thereof, the Town Manager or his designated representative
may prepare a verified statement of account of the actual costs of such removal
and abatement (including storage), the date the work was completed, and the
street address and the legal description of the real property on which said
work was done [including ten percent (10%) for administrative costs], and shall
serve a duplicate copy of such verified statement upon the owner or occupant of
said real property in the manner prescribed in Section
9-04a-080.
   B.   The owner or occupant of the real property shall have thirty (30)
calendar days from the date of service upon him to pay the assessment as
contained in the verified statement or appeal in writing to the Town Council
(through the Town Manager) from the amount of the assessment. If an appeal is
not so filed with the Town Council within such thirty (30) day period, then the
amount of the assessment as determined by the Town Manager shall become final
and binding. If an appeal is taken, the Town Council shall, at its next regular
meeting, hear and determine the appeal and may affirm the amount of the
assessment, modify the amount thereof, or determine that no assessment at all
shall be made.
   C.   If the assessment is not paid and no appeal is taken from the amount of
the assessment, or if an appeal is taken and the Town Council affirms or
modifies the amount of the assessment [and said amount is not paid within five
(5) calendar days of the Council decision], the original assessment or the
assessment as so modified shall be recorded in the Office of the Yavapai County
Recorder, and from the date of its recording it shall become a lien on the lot
or tract of adjacent land where the nuisance occurred until paid. Such liens
shall be subject and inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior
recorded mortgages and encumbrances of record.
   D.   If it is determined (either at the public hearing before the Board of
Adjustment or at a Council hearing on the assessment) that the junked motor
vehicle was placed on the real property without the consent of the owner or
person in lawful control of the property, and that said owner or person in
lawful control has not subsequently acquiesced in the presence of the vehicle,
the Council shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the
vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle was located, or otherwise
attempt to collect such costs from the owner or controller of the property.
   E.   A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under the provisions
of this Section shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure and order of sale.
The Town shall have the right to bring action to enforce the lien in the
Superior Court of Yavapai County at any time after the recording of the
assessment, but failure to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its
validity. The recorded assessment shall be prime facie evidence of the truth of
all matters recited therein, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to
the recording thereof. Failure to record a lien against the real property does
not in any way prohibit the Town from utilizing any and all other remedies it
may have against the person adjudged responsible for the nuisance, and the Town
may pursue any remedies in law or equity to recover its costs, including
administrative costs, involved in abating the nuisance, along with reasonable
attorney fees and investigative costs incurred.

In any criminal complaint proceeding for any violation of this Article:
   A.   Within ten (10) calendar days from the issuance of the complaint or at
the arraignment, whichever date comes first, the prosecution shall move to
dismiss the complaint if the defendant produces competent evidence of abatement
as set forth in Section
9-04a-090 herein. If necessary, the arraignment date may be continued to permit
Town verification of the abatement.
   B.   Photographic evidence showing that the vehicle did not have unexpired
number or license plates affixed thereto on the date the photographic evidence
was taken shall constitute prima facie evidence that the vehicle was not then
currently registered and licensed.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-140   Criminal Penalty.
Violation of this Article shall constitute a class 3 misdemeanor, and the

shall grant probation or suspend any fine established by this Section to a
payment lower than fifty dollars ($50.00) per violation.
(Ord. No. 559, Enacted, 07/10/03)
9-04a-150   Non-exclusive Remedies.
Nothing herein shall be construed to require selection of an exclusive remedy
to eliminate a public nuisance under this Article, and all available remedies,
including (but not limited to) abatement by the Town at the expense of the
vehicle owner and/or the property owner or occupant, criminal complaints, civil
citations, or civil actions for injunction, damages, etc., may be pursued
separately or concurrently.

         a.   Any building, unit, structure, facility, or installation from
which there is (or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which
commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under
Section 307(c) of the Act which will be applicable to such source if such
standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that Section, provided
that:
            (1)   The building, unit, structure, facility, or installation is
constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or
            (2)   The building, unit, structure, facility, or installation
totally replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge
of pollutants at an existing source; or
            (3)   The production or wastewater generating processes of the
building, unit, structure, facility, or installation are substantially
independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether
these are substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the
new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the
new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing
source, should be considered.
      b.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not
create a new building, unit, structure, facility, or installation meeting the
criteria of subparagraph (22)(a)(2) or (22)(a)(3) above, but otherwise alters,
replaces, or adds to existing process or production equipment.
      c.   Construction of a new source as defined under this subparagraph 22
has commenced if the owner or operator has:
         (1)   Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous onsite
construction program
            (a)   any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or
equipment; or
            (b)   significant site preparation work, including clearing,
excavation, or removal of existing buildings, units, structures, or facilities
which is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source
facilities or equipment; or
         (2)   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase
of facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation
within a reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be
terminated or modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility,
engineering, and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation
under this subparagraph 22(c).
      23.   "Noncontact Cooling Water" means water used for cooling which does
not come into direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste
product, or finished product.
      24.   "Pass Through" means a discharge which exits the wastewater system
into waters of the United States in quantities or concentrations which, alone
or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, is a cause
of a violation of any requirement of the Town's NPDES permit (including an
increase in the magnitude or duration of a violation).
      25.   "Person" means any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm,
company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate,
governmental entity, or any other legal entity; or their legal representatives,
agents, or assigns. This definition includes all federal, State, or local
governmental entities.
      26.   "pH" means the logarithm of the reciprocal of the weight of
hydrogen ions in grams per liter of solution, commonly referred to as a measure
of the acidity or alkalinity of a substance, expressed in standard units.

turbidity, color, BOD, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), toxicity, or odor.
      28.   “Premises,” “Real Property” or “Property” means the building, unit,
structure, designated turf area, or water storage area (including adjacent
areas and appurtenances) to which domestic water service, wastewater service,
and/or reclaimed water service is provided.
      29.   "Pretreatment" means the reduction of the amount of pollutants, the
elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant
properties in wastewater prior to (or in lieu of) introducing such pollutants
into the wastewater system. This reduction or alteration can be obtained by
physical, chemical, or biological processes; by process changes; or by other
means (except by diluting the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by
an applicable pretreatment standard).
      30.   "Pretreatment Requirements" means any substantive or procedural
requirement, other than a pretreatment standard, related to pretreatment and
imposed on a User.
      31.   "Pretreatment Standard or Standards" means prohibited discharge
standards, categorical pretreatment standards, and local limits.
      32.   "Prohibited Discharge Standards or Prohibited Discharges" means
prohibitions against the discharge of certain substances in this Article.
      33.   "Reclaimed Water" means all effluent discharged from the wastewater
treatment facility after treatment, and stored, transported, or recharged into
the underground aquifer by the reclaimed water system of the Town.
      34.   "Septic Tank Waste" means any sewage from holding tanks such as

wastewater to the wastewater system (excluding sanitary, noncontact cooling,
and boiler blowdown wastewater); or
            (2)   Contributes a process waste stream which makes up five
percent (5%) or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity
of the wastewater system treatment plant; or
             (3)   Is designated as such by the Town on the basis that it has a
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the wastewater system's operation
or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
         c.   Upon a finding that a User meeting the criteria in subparagraph
36(b) has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the wastewater
system's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Town may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition
received from a User [and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6)]
determine that such User should not be considered a Significant Industrial
User.
      37.   "Slug Load" means any discharge at a flow rate or concentration

9-05-030   Wastewater Treatment Fund Administration.
   A.   Establishment. A Wastewater Treatment Fund is hereby established to
account for all revenues and expenditures of the wastewater treatment system.
Nothing herein limits the authority of the Town, in conformance with standard
accounting and good financial management practices, to establish other funds,
subfunds, or accounts (i.e., debt service, replacement, etc.) and to transfer
monies between them and the Wastewater Treatment Fund for wastewater treatment
purposes and system administration purposes, or to make interfund loans as
allowed by law and approved by the Town Council.
   B.   Additional Regulations. The Town Council shall adopt additional
regulations for Fund administration from time to time by resolution.
(Ord. No. 284, Enacted, 10/08/92; Ord. No. 510, Amended, 08/23/01; Ord. No.
584, Amended, 03/25/04)
9-05-035   Establishing Wastewater Service.
   A.   Application. New wastewater treatment service to any building, Unit or
structure on real property, or any increase in the size of a wastewater service
connection to any building, Unit, or structure shall be initiated by
applications from Customers [or, in the case of the record owner(s) of real
property, their agent(s)] on forms established from time to time by the
Director. The information required at application and the consequences of
providing false information may be set from time to time by regulations adopted
by resolution.
   B.   Tenant Accounts. Applications by Customers who are Tenants must include
a copy of the lease or rental agreement for the property to be served. Tenants
applying for service to the leased/rental property shall be responsible to pay
all wastewater treatment rates, fees, charges, and penalties applicable to the
property. Where residential property consisting of five or more units is
occupied by multiple Tenants, Tenants may apply for utility service and place
their name on accounts only if each Tenant of the property is individually
metered for wastewater treatment services.
   C.   Deposit. Applications for wastewater treatment service shall be
accompanied by a deposit established from time to time by resolution, and
administered in accordance with regulations adopted from time to time by
resolution. An additional deposit may also be established by regulation from
time to time in cases of bankruptcy, as permitted under federal law.
   D.   Unauthorized Turn-On, Turn-Off, or Other Tampering. Except in emergency
circumstances, it shall be unlawful for any person to physically turn-on or
turn-off wastewater treatment service to any building, Unit, or structure, to
otherwise tamper with or damage the wastewater system, or to direct, aid, or
abet another in so doing without the approval of the Director after compliance
with established application requirements. In lieu of criminal prosecution for
such a misdemeanor violation, the Director may, at his/her sole discretion,
impose a civil penalty for such violation, which penalty shall be set from time
to time by resolution. The Director may also waive any per-day aspect of such
civil penalty in appropriate circumstances, and provide for set-off of such
penalties in return for payment of the actual costs of any damages.
(Ord. No. 510, Enacted, 08/23/01; Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16)
9-05-040   Wastewater Treatment Rates, Fees, Charges, and Penalties.
   A.   Classification of Users. For the purpose of establishing reasonable
wastewater treatment rates, fees, charges, and penalties, Users of the
wastewater system shall be classified into three (3) categories, as follows:
      1.   Residential. The residential classification shall include single
family homes and individual dwelling Units within multi-family residential
structures. A residential classification is not lost by reason of a "home
occupation" if the activity in no manner contributes to discharges to the
wastewater system. Each dwelling Unit in a multi-family dwelling is considered
a separate residential User.
       2.   Commercial. Unless required to have an Industrial Wastewater
Pretreatment Permit, the commercial classification shall include institutional
Users such as government entities, schools, churches, and nonprofit
organizations, as well as transient and group quarters (i.e., hotels/ motels,
rooming houses, nursing homes, etc.). [A residential Unit located within a
structure utilized for commercial purposes or located on property used for
commercial purposes (i.e., mini-storage manager/caretaker residences, etc.)
shall be considered a separate commercial User for purposes of establishing
Base User Rates.] Each separate or separately-metered commercial unit in a
structure or unified complex utilized for commercial purposes shall be
considered a separate commercial User.
      3.   Industrial. An industrial User shall be any entity required to have
an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit under this Article; otherwise it
shall be classified as commercial. Each separate or separately-metered
industrial Unit in a structure or unified complex utilized for industrial
purposes shall be considered a separate industrial User.
   B.   Wastewater Rates, Fees, Charges, and Penalties. Wastewater rates, fees,
charges, and penalties shall be set by resolution from time to time, in
accordance with the Intent and Scope of this Article and with applicable
Arizona and federal statutes.
      1.   Coordination with Other Fees and Assessments. Nothing herein shall
limit the authority of the Town to impose development fees in accordance with
ARS 9-463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time), or to
establish improvement district assessments per ARS 48-571 et seq. and fees in-
lieu of such assessments in order to upgrade and expand the wastewater
treatment system. However, any Wastewater System Connection Charges paid
hereunder shall be offset, in whole or in part, against any such fees and
assessments in accordance with law.
   C.   Billing. Billing of residential, commercial and industrial Customers
for wastewater treatment services shall be accomplished as set forth from time
to time by regulations adopted by resolution.
      1.   Taxes. In addition to the wastewater treatment rates, fees, charges,
and penalties established from time to time by resolution, wastewater treatment
billings shall include any applicable taxes on the business of wastewater
treatment service.
      2.   Time Covered by Rates. With regard to wastewater rates, fees,
charges, penalties, and taxes, any Base User Rates are applied to the current
billing period while any Volume Rates and all other wastewater rates, fees,
charges, penalties, and taxes are applied to the prior billing period.
      3.   Delinquency Dates. Wastewater rates, fees, charges, penalties, and
taxes are due on different dates for different Customers based on billing
cycles. Such dates shall be specified for each Customer when service begins and
shall be set forth in the billings received. Payment is due twenty (20) days
after the billing date. Wastewater rates, fees, charges, penalties, and taxes
are delinquent on the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the billing date. Nothing
herein shall preclude the Director from changing a Customer's billing period,
so long as adjustments are made in billings to reflect actual usage.
      4.   Consequences of Account Delinquencies. Account delinquencies in
relation to wastewater rates, fees, charges, penalties, or taxes shall result
in an "Active Account Processing Charge", set from time to time by resolution,
being applied to the account on the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the billing
date. Furthermore, wastewater treatment service will be subject to turn-off on
and after the fiftieth (50th) day after the billing date (unless emergency
circumstances justify immediate turn-off of wastewater treatment service).
      5.   Application of Partial Payments. The application of partial payments
to delinquent accounts shall be established from time to time by regulations
adopted by resolution. Partial payments shall not avoid wastewater treatment
service turn-off nor shall they renew wastewater treatment service (except as
specified in any payment agreements).
      6.   Prepayments. Nothing herein shall preclude the Town from limiting
prepayments by regulations adopted from time to time by resolution.
      7.   Customer Inquiry Required. Failure of a Customer to receive any
monthly wastewater treatment service billing or other communication from the
Director with regard to applicable wastewater rates, fees, charges, penalties,
or taxes, shall expressly not excuse the Customer from paying wastewater rates,
fees, charges, penalties, or taxes due.
   D.   Delinquency Procedures. Procedures to be followed in the event of
account delinquencies shall be established from time to time by regulations
adopted by resolution. Such procedures shall include such enforcement measures
as are available to the Town in law and in equity (including, but expressly not
limited to, domestic water service turn-off), and shall provided for such
notice to Customers and opportunities for administrative hearings prior to
application of enforcement procedures (including, but not limited to, turn-off
of domestic water service) as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances and
complies with requirements of due process.
      1.   Payment Agreements. Nothing herein shall preclude the Director from
offering to enter into Payment Agreements with Customers who have delinquent
utility accounts at any stage of the enforcement process, as set forth from
time to time by regulations adopted by resolution.
   E.   Procedure When Retrofitting Wastewater System to Already-Developed
Properties. With regard to wastewater treatment service, during the initial
start-up period for any phase or portion of the wastewater system (whether or
not constructed by the Town through an improvement district), Customers on
already-developed lots, parcels or properties included within such phase or
portion shall be responsible for payment of applicable rates, fees, charges,
penalties, and taxes from the time the system becomes "operational" in the
area. The wastewater system is operational in an area (with regard to
individual lots, parcels or properties) on 1) the date said lots, parcels, or
properties are connected to the phase or portion of the system by the
construction contractor, 2) the date said lots, parcels or properties would
have been connected to the phase or portion of the system had Customers
reasonably cooperated with the construction contractor in order to be connected
(i.e. had provided necessary construction easements, assisted and permitted
construction crews to construct necessary service lines, permitted construction
crews to actually connect appropriate structures on the lot, parcel, or
property to the system, etc.) or 3) the date Customers were told in writing was
the date appropriate structures on the lots, parcels or properties should be
connected by them to the system.
      1.   Later Responsibility Date Set in Writing. Nothing herein precludes
Department personnel, upon approval of the Town Council, from setting a later
date for Customers to be responsible for wastewater rates, fees, charges,
penalties, and taxes when those Customers' lots, parcels or properties have not
actually been connected to the system, but only in conjunction with a final
written notice to said Customers requiring that appropriate structures on their
lots, parcels or properties be connected by them to the wastewater system by a
date certain.
      2.   Coordination with Improvement District Assessments or Other
Development Charges. Furthermore, nothing herein shall preclude the Town from
applying wastewater rates, fees, charges, penalties, and taxes to Customers and
their particular lots, parcels or properties, simply because an improvement
district assessment or other development charge has been applied to the
property for purposes of financing initial construction of a phase or portion
of the wastewater system.
    F.   Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Permit Fees. In addition to any
other rates, fees, charges, and penalties authorized by this Article, the
Council may adopt reasonable Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Permit Fees for
reimbursement of various costs related to pretreatment programs, including (but
not limited to):
      1.   The cost of processing applications;
      2.   The cost of collecting and analyzing a User's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by Users;
      3.   Costs of reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction;
      4.   Costs of filing appeals; and
      5.   Other costs to carry out the requirements contained herein.
These Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Permit Fees relate solely to the
matters covered by this Article and are separate from all other rates, fees,
charges, and penalties chargeable by the Town.
(Ord. No. 284, Enacted, 10/08/92; Ord. No. 389, Amended, 07/11/96; Ord. No.
391, Amended, 06/27/96; Ord. No. 466, Amended, 07/08/99; Ord. No. 510, Amended,

Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16)
9-05-050   Wastewater Treatment System Extensions.
   A.   Approval. The Town shall approve the design of, issue permits for, and
conduct inspections of all extensions of public sanitary sewer lines and
related wastewater treatment facilities that are to be attached to the
wastewater system.
   B.   Design and Construction. The design and construction of all sanitary
sewer lines and related facilities under the jurisdiction of the Town must
conform to such design and construction specifications as are adopted by the
Town from time to time, as well as Arizona State Health Services Bulletin #11.
As to size, the Town may require sanitary sewer lines and related facilities to
be sized for future extensions.
   C.   Inspection. All sanitary sewer lines and related facilities to be
attached directly or indirectly to the wastewater system shall be subject to
inspection by the Town. Engineering plan review and inspection fees shall be
charged as provided for in Chapter 16 of this Code. No physical alteration of
or attachment to the Town's wastewater system shall commence without a Town
inspector being present or without the inspector's express permission. There
shall be no discharge into the wastewater system prior to obtaining necessary
Town inspections and approval of the completed construction.
   D.   Subdivisions. Extension of the wastewater system into subdivisions
shall be according to Subsections
14-04-040(G) and
14-04-070 of this Code.
   E.   Other Developments. All other developments requiring separate approval
by the Town shall construct extensions of the wastewater system, including
sanitary sewer lines and related facilities such as lift stations, provided
they are within a reasonable distance to the system. The determination of what
is a reasonable distance shall be made by the Town, based on (1) the nature and
size of uses proposed for the development, (2) whether service can be provided
by gravity flow or requires lift stations, (3) the capacity of existing public
sanitary sewer lines and related facilities to which an extension would be
attached, and (4) other considerations deemed appropriate by the Town.
      New developments which are determined by the Town to not be within a
reasonable distance to an operational existing sewer service area may be
required, where deemed appropriate, to construct sanitary sewer lines and
related facilities (including temporary treatment facilities) according to
standards and specifications approved by the Town, in preparation for future
connection to the wastewater system when it comes within a reasonable distance.
   F.   Coordination With Fees, Assessments and Charges. Nothing herein shall
limit the authority of the Town to impose development fees in accordance with
ARS 9-463.05 and Town Code
Article 7-11 (all as amended from time to time), to establish improvement
district assessments per ARS 48-571 et seq. and fees in-lieu of such
assessments, or to apply Wastewater System Connection Charges calculated to
recover the Town's costs to upgrade and extend the wastewater system to provide
wastewater treatment services to new development. However, such fees,
assessments and charges may be mutually offset, in whole or in part, or may be
offset in whole or in part by the value of the construction undertaken by
developers to extend the system, in accordance with law.
   G.   Replacement or Repair. Persons or entities that build or cause to be
built any extensions of the wastewater system shall pay for any repairs or
replacements made necessary as a direct or indirect result of such
construction, including (for example) repair or replacement of curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, road surfaces, drainage structures, and utilities damaged or
disturbed during the building of wastewater line extensions.
(Ord. No. 284, Enacted, 10/08/92; Ord. No. 357, Amended, 03/23/95; Ord. No.
389, Amended, 07/11/96; Ord. No. 510, Amended, 08/23/01; Ord. No. 815, Amended,
04/28/16)
9-05-060   Connections.
   A.   Wastewater Service Connections Required. Every separate building, Unit,
or structure to which wastewater treatment service is supplied shall have its
own service connection. Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the Department,
it is unlawful for any Customer having a wastewater treatment service
connection to supply or permit utility service to be supplied through said
connection to any other User, whether gratuitously or for consideration.
      In the event that a stub-out has been included in the main line for a
particular adjacent lot, parcel or property, then connection to the main line
from any building, unit, structure, designated turf area, or water storage area
on that lot, parcel or property shall be at that stub-out. If a stub-out has
not been constructed in the mainline for a particular adjacent lot, parcel or
property, then connection from any building, unit, structure, designated turf
area, or water storage area on the property must be at a location specified by
the Town and the necessary stub-out must be constructed at the Customer’s
expense.
   B.   Existing Developed Properties. All existing developed properties within
the appropriate distances established from time to time in the Town Code shall
connect to the wastewater treatment system at the record owner(s) expense
within ninety (90) days after the system is operational. If, as part of a
specific initial service plan for an area, the Town has assumed the
responsibility of providing connections to existing developed properties, this
time for connection may be extended until the Town makes (or would have made if
the property owner had given his or her timely written consent in a form
acceptable to the Town) the connection in conformance with the plan. All
connections shall be in accordance with the Town's Engineering Standards as
adopted from time to time.
      1.   When Wastewater System is "Operational". A phase or portion of the
wastewater treatment system is operational in an area (with regard to
individual lots, parcels, or properties) on either a) the date said lots,
parcels or properties would have been connected to the phase or portion of the
wastewater treatment system had customers reasonably cooperated with the
construction contractor in order to be connected (i.e. had provided necessary
construction easements, assisted and permitted construction crews to construct
necessary service lines, permitted construction crews to actually connect
appropriate structures on the lot, parcel, or property to the wastewater
system, etc.), or b) the date customers were told in writing was the date
appropriate buildings, Units, or structures on the lots, parcels or properties
should be connected to the wastewater system.
      2.   Option for Contractor to Make Connections. If, as part of a specific
initial service plan for an area, the construction contractor assumes
responsibility for connecting existing developed properties to a phase or
portion of the wastewater treatment system during construction [without cost to
the Customers], then the time for connection may be extended until the
contractor either makes the connection or would have made the connection if a)
the Customers had consented and cooperated as set forth hereinabove, or b) the
connection had not been outside the scope of the contractor's contract because
of physical barriers (however caused).
      3.   Default Connection by Customers. If Customers have not so consented
and cooperated, or if the connection is outside of the construction
contractor's contract (however caused), then said Customers must connect the
property at their own expense within the original ninety (90) days of
wastewater treatment system availability.
      4.   Option to Set Later Connection Date. Nothing herein shall preclude
Department personnel, upon approval of the Town Council, from setting a later
date in writing for Customers to connect to the wastewater treatment system.
      5.   Abandonment of Private Septic Systems. In the event buildings,
Units, or structures on lots, parcels or properties with private sewage
disposal systems are connected to a phase or portion of the wastewater
treatment system, the private sewage disposal systems must be abandoned within
sixty (60) days after such connection, in accordance with rules and regulations
promulgated by the Yavapai County Board of Health, the Arizona Department of
Health Services, and/or the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.
Failure of Customers to properly abandon private sewage disposal systems within
the time specified shall be reported to appropriate State or County agencies,
and Department personnel shall cooperate fully with such agencies to abate the
nuisance created by such failure.
         a.   Contractor Responsibility. If, as part of a specific initial
service plan for an area, the construction contractor assumes responsibility
for connecting existing developed properties to the wastewater treatment system
during construction (without cost to the Customers), and such plan includes
abandoning private sewage disposal systems, then enforcement of this
requirement may be "tolled" until the contractor either abandons the private
sewage disposal systems in the course of his contract or would have done so if
i) the Customers had consented and cooperated by providing necessary
construction easements, permitting entry onto property, etc., or ii) the
abandonment were not outside the scope of the contractor's contract because of
physical barriers (however caused).
         b.   Customer Non-Cooperation. If i) Customers do not so consent and
cooperate by the time that a construction contractor is released from an area
by the Town (after having abandoned the other private sewage disposal systems
on lots, parcels or properties in the area where permission had been granted
and which could reasonably be abandoned pursuant to contract), or ii) the
abandonment is outside of the construction contractor's contract (however
caused) and Customers do not themselves arrange to abandon their private sewage
disposal system in accordance with the regulations within sixty (60) days of
connection to the wastewater treatment system, then enforcement shall be sought
by the Town as set forth above.
            i.   Nothing herein shall preclude Department personnel, upon
approval of the Town Council, from setting a later date in writing for
Customers to abandon private sewage disposal systems on their lots, parcels or
properties, prior to seeking enforcement as set forth above.
      6.   Nothing herein shall preclude the Town from refunding wastewater
rates, fees, charges, penalties and taxes to Customers in the event it is
discovered that their particular lots, parcels or properties had not, in fact,
been connected to the wastewater treatment system through no failure on the
part of said Customers to comply with this Article.
   C.   After-Developed Properties. All developments (including single family
dwellings) within the appropriate distance as set from time to time in the Town
Code from the wastewater treatment system which are to be approved for
occupancy after the wastewater system is operational, shall be required to
connect to the system at the expense of the record owner(s) before occupancy is
approved by the Town. All connections shall be in accordance with the Town's
Engineering Standards as adopted from time to time.
   D.   Other Assessments, Fees, and Charges. In addition to any Wastewater
System Connection Charges which may be applied from time to time by resolution,
in areas previously included within improvement districts created by the Town
to extend the wastewater treatment system to such areas, if an assessment has
not been previously paid to the Town to make the system available to a property
(or if the assessment paid for that property was not in proportion to payments
made for other similar properties, e.g. because of a property split, increased
intensity of development, etc.), a separate in-lieu of assessment fee,
calculated to be equivalent to the original assessment, may be imposed by the
Town at the time development permits are issued as a condition of developing
the property. Such in-lieu of assessment fee may be established from time to
time by resolution. Furthermore, development fees pursuant to ARS 9- 463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time) and Wastewater
System Connection Charges may be imposed as a condition of developing the
property. However, any such assessments, fees and charges shall be subject to
mutual offset, in whole or in part, in accordance with law.
   E.   Permits and Inspections. No physical connection shall be made to the
wastewater system until a permit for the same has been acquired from the
Building Official in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Town Code (as amended
from time to time), after payment of all required fees and charges, unless the
connection is made by the Department. All connections shall conform to the
International Plumbing Code, as adopted and amended by the Town from time to
time. In addition to any other inspections, tests, and right-of-way permits
that may be required, inspection and approval of wastewater system connections
shall be required before any trench or hole is backfilled. Any plan review and
inspection fee adopted from time to time by resolution may be waived under an
initial service plan where the connection is made by the Town or a contractor
that assumes responsibility for connecting existing developed properties during
construction without cost to the Customer.
   F.   Damage. In accordance with Town Code
7-10-030, any damage done to the wastewater system or to the public right-of-
way as a result of construction of a connection or any related construction or
excavation activity shall be repaired to the Town's satisfaction at the
constructing party's expense. The Town may require a bond of the party doing
such construction or excavation prior to the activity being undertaken.
   G.   Inspection Manhole. All industrial Users must install an inspection
manhole at the location and to the specifications of the Town. This manhole
shall be available to Town personnel at all times for use in flow measurement
and testing.
   H.   Criminal Violation. The requirement that buildings, Units and
structures on lots, parcels or properties be connected to the wastewater
treatment system (as set forth herein) is subject to vigorous enforcement by
all equitable and legal means available, including civil and criminal actions
against Customers. In this regard, failure to connect to the wastewater
treatment system as set forth herein constitutes a class 1 misdemeanor (with
each separate day being a separate offense).
      1.   Deferred Enforcement. Deferred enforcement or non-enforcement of
this requirement by the Town should not be construed as a waiver of future
enforcement with regard to the particular Customers and lots, parcels or
properties involved.
   I.   Customer Agreements to Maintain Non-Gravity-Flow Facilities. In the
event individual Customers, the record owner(s), contractors, or developers
either cannot or choose not to develop particular lots, parcels or properties
so as to connect to the wastewater treatment system by gravity flow, a building
permit will only issue if said Customers, record owners, contractors, or
developers enter into a binding agreement with the Town to construct and
maintain at their sole expense any non-gravity flow facilities, including
lengthy service lines, needed to connect to the wastewater treatment system.

9-05-065   Wastewater System Maintenance.
   A.   Facilities Included in Wastewater Treatment System. The wastewater
treatment system includes the "trunk system" and the "collector system". The
"trunk system" includes all pipe larger than eight inches (8") in diameter. The
"collector system" includes all pipe 8" or less in diameter, including the
"service tap" between the main line and the property line. However, the
collector system does not include service lines from the building sewer or
private sewer out to the property line.
   B.   Responsibility for Maintenance of Wastewater Treatment System. The
Department is generally responsible for the care and maintenance of the
wastewater treatment system from manhole to manhole, including any emergency
responses. Unless otherwise expressly provided for by written contract,
Customers are responsible for the care and maintenance of service lines and
service taps serving their lots, parcels or properties. Procedures for the
handling of stoppages shall be set from time to time by regulations adopted by
resolution.
   C.   Requirements Prior to Excavations. No Customer, User, or person shall
make or begin any excavation in any public street, alley, right-of-way
dedicated to public use, utility easement, or express or implied private
property utility easement included in the wastewater treatment system without
first (1) determining whether utility system facilities (above-ground or
underground) will be encountered (and, if so, where they are located), and 2)
taking measures for control of the facilities in a careful and prudent manner.
No person shall begin excavating before the location of said facilities is
marked or he or she is notified that marking is unnecessary. Additional
provisions relating to excavation of public property shall be established from
time to time by regulations adopted by resolution.
   D.   Prohibition Against Damaging Wastewater Treatment System. No Customer,
User, or person shall knowingly or negligently damage the wastewater treatment
system (including, but expressly not limited to, damage caused by unlawful
discharge to the wastewater system, improper connection to the wastewater
system, and negligent excavation or other construction in, on, or around the
wastewater system).
      1.   Enforcement Options. Knowing or negligent damage to the wastewater
treatment system is subject to vigorous pursuit of any and all remedies
available to the Town, including (but expressly not limited to) injunction,
abatement, discontinuation of service, actions for damages, civil penalties,
and criminal penalties. [Note: exemption from civil penalty or liability for
gardening or tilling with hand tools on own property; ARS 40-360.28(F)(3)]
Procedures for discontinuing wastewater service in the event of damage to the
wastewater system shall be established from time to time by regulations adopted
by resolution.
(Ord. No. 510, Enacted, 08/23/01; Ord No. 839, Amended, 02/22/18)
9-05-070   Restrictions on Discharges.
   A.   Required Approval. Discharge into the wastewater treatment system of
any wastewater having one or more of the following attributes requires the
written approval of the Town:
      1.   A five (5) day BOD greater than three hundred (300) milligrams per
liter by weight;
      2.   TSS of more than three hundred fifty (350) milligrams per liter of
weight; or
      3.   An average monthly flow of greater than fifty thousand (50,000)
gallons.
   B.   Surcharge Factor. The Town shall impose a surcharge factor on
wastewater Volume Rates as provided from time to time by resolution, on
designated Users who discharge wastes having strength of BOD or TSS greater
than twice normal domestic waste. The surcharge factors shall only be applied
if the average of BOD and TSS together is greater than 500, and shall only be
applied in each case to the parts per million (ppm) above 500.
      In determining whether to add the surcharge factors to Volume Rates in
particular billings, staff may refer to the typical strengths of BOD and TSS
shown in Table A below, in lieu of laboratory analyses. However, Users who so
desire may supply analyses from certified laboratories at their own expense as
often as may be required in writing by the Utilities Director.

      Failure by a Customer to pay the surcharge factor imposed and to provide
corrective measures as may be required to prevent unauthorized discharges,
after due notice by the Town and after being given a reasonable time to comply,
shall be sufficient cause to discontinue wastewater services without further
notice.
   C.   Septage. Septage shall only be discharged at the wastewater treatment
facility in accordance with rules established by the Town, unless permission is
granted in writing to discharge at another location. This restriction shall not
apply to residential Users discharging (through adequate plumbing facilities on
their own property) the wastewater tank of a normal recreational vehicle owned
and operated solely by said Users.
(Ord. No. 284, Enacted, 10/08/92; Ord. No. 466, Amended, 07/08/99; Ord. No.
510, Amended, 08/23/01; Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16)
9-05-080   Discharge Prohibitions.
   A.   Prohibited Discharge Standards.
      1.   General Prohibitions. No User shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the wastewater system any pollutant or wastewater which causes
pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all Users of
the wastewater system whether or not they are subject to categorical
pretreatment standards or any other federal, State, or local pretreatment
standards or requirements.
      2.   Specific Prohibitions. In connection with
Article 7-03 of this Code (and except as provided in this Article), no User or
other person shall discharge or permit to be discharged any of the following
described waters or wastes into the wastewater system:
         a.   Wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred twenty
(120) degrees Fahrenheit, or which will inhibit biological activity in the
treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which
causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed
one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit [forty (40) degrees Celsius];
         b.   Any water or waste which contains fats, oil, or grease in amounts
that cause obstruction or interference of the wastewater treatment system, and
at no time in amounts greater than one hundred (100) parts per million;
         c.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the
wastewater system, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-

a hazard to humans, or create any hazard in the utilization of the reclaimed
water from the wastewater system;
         g.   Any waters or wastes containing dissolved or suspended solids of
such character and quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to
handle such materials in the wastewater treatment system;
         h.   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater
which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to
create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the
sewers for maintenance or repair;
         i.   Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which,
either singly or by interactions with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the wastewater system;
         j.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through;
         k.   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points approved
by the Town;
         l.   In connection with
Article 7-03 of this Code, any drainage waters, including (but not limited to)
storm water, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, or cellar or other
subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, or de-ionized water,
without the express permission of the Town;
         m.   Any noncontact cooling or unpolluted process water, without the
express permission of the Town;
         n.   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of

         o.   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Town in
an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit; or
         p.   Any material into a manhole through its top, unless specifically
authorized by the Town.
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this Subsection shall not
be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the
wastewater system.
   B.   Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment
standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby
incorporated and:
      1.   Equivalent Mass Limits. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is
expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant
in wastewater, the Town may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c);
      2.   Alternate Limit. When wastewater subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same
standard, the Town shall impose an alternate limit using the combined
wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e);
      3.   Obtaining Variance. A User may obtain a variance from a categorical
pretreatment standard if the User can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge
are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing
the categorical pretreatment standard; and
      4.   Net Gross Adjustment. A User may obtain a net gross adjustment to a
categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   C.   State Pretreatment Standards. State pretreatment standards and any
other applicable State standards or requirements are hereby incorporated.
   D.   Local Limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect
against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of the following (in milligrams per liter):
Total grease, oil, etc. 100.0    Copper     1.6
Dissolved Sulfides      0.5
Cyanide                 1.3      Fluoride   Reserved
Arsenic                 0.5      Lead       0.3
Antimony                Reserved Mercury    0.001
Barium                  Reserved Molybdenum Reserved
Beryllium               Reserved Nickel     Reserved
Cadmium                 0.1      Selenium   0.2
Chromium (total)        3.0      Silver     0.5
Chromium VI             Reserved Thallium   2.2
                                 Zinc       2.9
 
      The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to
the wastewater system. All concentrations for metallic substances are for
"total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The Town may impose mass limitations
in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
       No non-residential User shall discharge wastewater containing restricted
substances into the wastewater system in excess of limitations specified in its
industrial wastewater pretreatment permit, or adopted by resolution by the
Town. The Town shall publish and revise from time to time standards (local
limits) for specific restricted substances. These standards shall be developed
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.5 and shall implement the objectives of this
Article. Standards published in accordance with this Subsection will be deemed
pretreatment standards for the purposes of Section 307(d) of the Act.
      The Town may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of
concentration based limitations. The Town may also revise or modify the
standards (local limits) as required, or if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives or the general and specific prohibitions in this Article, or to
ensure compliance with federal, State, or local law.
   E.   Right of Revision. The Town reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in industrial wastewater pretreatment permits, more stringent
standards or requirements on discharges to the wastewater system.
   F.   Dilution. No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation, unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Town may impose mass limitations on Users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   G.   Application of Most Stringent Limitations. For a discharge regulated by
Categorical Pretreatment Standards or other federal, State, or local discharge
limitations or requirements, the most stringent limitations and requirements
will apply.
   H.   Deadline for Compliance with Categorical Standards.
      1.   Compliance Time. Compliance by existing sources with categorical
pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard
is effective, unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate
subpart of 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N.
      2.   New Sources. New sources shall install, have in operating condition,
and start up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable
pretreatment standards.
(Ord. No. 284, Enacted, 10/08/92; Ord. No. 391, Amended, 06/27/96; Ord. No.
510, Amended, 08/23/01; Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16; Ord. No. 839, Amended,
02/22/18)
9-05-090   Pretreatment of Wastewater.
   A.   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Article and shall achieve compliance with all
federal pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in
this Article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the
Town (whichever is more stringent). Any facilities necessary to meet the
requirements of this Article shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
User's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Town for review, and shall be approved by
the Town before such facilities are constructed. The review and/or approval of
such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the User from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the Town under the provisions of this Article.
   B.   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      1.   Town Authority to Restrict Discharge. Whenever deemed necessary, the
Town may require Users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams
from industrial waste streams, and apply such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the wastewater system and determine the User's compliance
with the requirements of this Article.
      2.   Town Authority to Require Flow-Control Facility. The Town may
require any person discharging into the wastewater system to install and
maintain, on that person's property and at that person's expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      3.   Town Authority to Require Grease Interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand
interceptors or traps shall be provided by user when, in the opinion of the
Town, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients;
except that such interceptors shall not normally be required for a building
used for residential purposes. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Town and shall be so located as to be easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall regularly be inspected,
cleaned, and repaired by the User at the User's expense in order to maintain
the same in a continuously operational condition.
      4.   Town Authority to Require Gas Detection Meter. Users with the
potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   C.   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. At least once every two (2)
years the Town shall evaluate whether each Significant Industrial User needs an
accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Town may require any User to
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the Town of any accidental or
slug discharge, as required by this Article. Such notification must also be
given for any discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in
this Article; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
The review and/or approval of such plans will in no way relieve the User from
the responsibility of modifying such plans or facilities as necessary to comply
with the provisions of this Article.
   D.   Hauled Wastewater.
      1.   Septic Tank Waste. Septic tank waste may be introduced into the
wastewater system only by certain dischargers at such locations and at such
times as are established by the Town. If such discharges comply with the
established requirements, the wastes discharged shall not violate this Article,
or any other requirements established by the Town. The Town may require
commercial septic tank waste haulers to obtain industrial wastewater
pretreatment permits.
      2.   Industrial Waste Haulers. The Town shall require haulers of
industrial waste to obtain industrial wastewater pretreatment permits. The Town
may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain industrial
wastewater pretreatment permits. The Town also may prohibit the discharge of
hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to
all other requirements of this Article.
      3.   Limits on Locations to Discharge Industrial Waste. Industrial waste
haulers may only discharge loads at locations designated by the Town. No load
may be discharged without prior consent of the Town. The Town may collect
samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The
Town may also require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior
to discharge.
      4.   Tracking Form for Industrial Waste Haulers. Industrial waste haulers
must provide a waste- tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at
a minimum, name and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck
identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known
or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous
wastes.
(Ord. No. 391, Enacted, 06/27/96; Ord. No. 510, Amended, 08/23/01; Ord. No.
815, Amended, 04/28/16)
9-05-100   Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Permit.
   A.   Introduction.
      1.   Discharge Subject to Terms of Permit. Any permit granted by the Town
to an industrial User granting the right to discharge to the wastewater system
shall be subject to the terms and conditions (including, but not limited to,
monitoring requirements and fees) set forth in the permit.
      2.   Application of Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Permits.
Industrial wastewater pretreatment permits shall be required of:
         a.   Any User needing written approval under this Article;
         b.   Any User who has a discharge which is permissible only if
pretreatment of the wastewater by the User is performed prior to its entry into
the wastewater system;
         c.   Any User whose discharge requires special handling or
extraordinary monitoring by wastewater treatment system personnel and
equipment, including (but expressly not limited to) grease traps, oil - water
separators, sand traps, silver recovery systems, lint traps or any similar
devices;
         d.   Any Significant Industrial User, except a Significant Industrial
User that has filed a timely application pursuant to this Article may continue
to discharge for the time period specified therein;
         e.   Any User whose discharge has or may have reasonable potential for
adversely affecting the wastewater treatment system's operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement; and
         f.   Other Users as necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Article.
      3.   Additional Compliance With Applicable Law. Any violation of the
terms and conditions of an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit shall be
deemed a violation of this Article and subjects the industrial wastewater
pretreatment permittee to the sanctions set out in this Article. Obtaining an
industrial wastewater pretreatment permit does not relieve a permittee of its
obligation to comply with all federal and State pretreatment standards or
requirements, or with any other requirements of federal, State, and local law.
   B.   Application.
      1.   Wastewater Analysis. When requested by the Town, a User must submit
information on the nature and characteristics of the User's wastewater. The
Town is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically
require Users to update the information. Failure to provide the information
shall be reasonable grounds for denying or terminating service to the User and
shall be considered a violation of this Article.
      2.   Existing Connections. Any User required to obtain an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit who was discharging wastewater into the
wastewater system prior to the effective date of this Article and who wishes to
continue such discharges in the future, shall, within ninety (90) days after
said date, apply to the Town for an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit
in accordance with this Article, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the
wastewater system to continue after one hundred fifty (150) days of the
effective date of this Article, except in accordance with an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit issued by the Town.
      3.   New Connections. Any User required to obtain an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit that proposes to begin or recommence discharging
into the wastewater system must obtain such permit at the same time it obtains
any building permit or other development permit under the technical building
codes of the Town Code. In no event shall an application for an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit be filed any later than sixty (60) days prior to
the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
      4.   Contents. All Users required to obtain an industrial wastewater
pretreatment permit must submit a permit application. The Town may require a
User to submit as part of an application the following information:
         a.   The information required by this Article;
          b.   Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on
the premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or

User subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Town a report containing the information described in this Article. For
Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in
accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the User's long-term production rate. For all other Users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with this Article.
   D.   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      1.   Report on Nature of Pollutants. All Significant Industrial Users
shall, at a frequency determined by the Town but in no case less than every six
(6) months, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
this Article.
      2.   Appropriate Monitoring. All wastewater samples must be
representative of the User's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained
in good working order at all times. The failure of a User to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the User to
claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
      3.   More Frequent Monitoring.  If a User subject to the reporting
requirement in this Subsection monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the Town, using the procedures prescribed in this Article, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   E.   Report of Changed Conditions. Each User must notify the Town of any
planned significant changes to the User's operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days
before the change. In addition:
      1.   Application for Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Permit May Be
Required. The Town may require the User to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of
an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit application under this Article.
      2.   Town Issuance of Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Permit May Be
Required. The Town may issue an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit under
this Article or modify an existing industrial wastewater discharge permit under
Subparagraph
9-05-100(D)(1) of this Article in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
      3.   Town Response A Prerequisite. No User shall implement the planned
changed conditions until and unless the Town has responded to the User's
notice.
      4.   Significant Changes Defined. For purposes of this requirement,
significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow changes of twenty
percent (20%) or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported
pollutants.
   F.   Reports of Potential Problems.
      1.   Town Notification. In the case of any discharge, including, but not
limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature,
a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential
problems for the wastewater system (including a violation of the prohibited
discharge standards in this Article), the User shall immediately telephone and
notify the Town of the incident. This notification shall include the location
of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if known), and
corrective actions taken by the User.
      2.   Subsequent Written Report. Within five (5) days following such
discharge, the User shall, unless waived by the Town, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater system, natural resources, or
any other damage to persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve
the User of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this Article.
      3.   Failure to Provide Notice. Failure to notify the Town of potential
problem discharges shall be deemed a violation of this Article.
      4.   Information to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on
the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a discharge described in Subparagraph F(1) above.
Employers shall ensure that all employees are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
   G.   Reports from Unpermitted Users. All Users not required to obtain an
industrial wastewater pretreatment permit shall provide appropriate reports as
may be required by the Town.
   H.   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Town as
soon as possible but no later than twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The User shall also immediately repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Town within the time
period specified by the Town, but at no time greater than thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. The User may not be required to resample
if the Town monitors at the User's facility at least once a month, or if the
Town samples between the User's initial sampling and when the User receives the
results of this sampling.
   I.   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
      1.   Notice of Discharge. Any User who commences the discharge of
hazardous waste shall notify the Town, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities (in writing) of any
discharge into the wastewater system of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40
CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the User discharges more than one hundred
(100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the wastewater system, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the User: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this Subparagraph
9-05-120(I)(1) need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under this
Article. The notification requirement in this Subsection
9-05-120(I) does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-
monitoring requirements of this Article.
      2.   Exemption From Notice Requirement. Dischargers are exempt from the
requirements of Subparagraph
9-05-120(I)(1) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous
waste do not require additional notification.
      3.   In Case of New Federal Regulations. In the case of any new
regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics
of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste,
the User must notify the Town, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
      4.   Certification of Reduction Program. In the case of any notification
made under this Subsection
9-05-120(I), the User shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce
the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
      5.   No Authorization of Prohibited Discharge. This reporting provision
does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to
be discharged by this Article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable
federal or State law.
   J.   Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses (including sampling
techniques) to be submitted as part of an industrial wastewater pretreatment
permit application or report, shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 unless otherwise specified in an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved
by the EPA.
   K.   Sample Collection.
      1.   Appropriate Technique. Except as indicated in Subparagraph
9-05-120(K)(2) below, the User must collect wastewater samples using flow
proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional
sampling is infeasible, the Town may authorize the use of time proportional
sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the User demonstrates that
this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits.
      2.   Specific Techniques. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH,
cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
   L.   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date post-marked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a
mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt
of the report shall govern.
   M.   Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
Article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this Article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available
for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the Town, or
where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the U.S. EPA, the State, or the Town.
(Ord. No. 391, Enacted, 06/27/96; Ord. No. 510, Amended, 08/23/01)
9-05-130   Compliance Monitoring.
   A.   Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling.  The Town shall have the right
upon presentation of proper credentials to enter the premises of any User to
determine whether the User is complying with all requirements of this Article
and any industrial wastewater pretreatment permit or order issued hereunder.
Users shall allow the Town ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
      1.   Arrangement for Town Entry. Where a User has security measures in
force which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto its
premises, the User shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards
so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Town will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
      2.   Town Right to Install Devices. The Town shall have the right to set
up on the User's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the User's operations.
      3.   User Monitoring Equipment. The Town may require the User to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the User at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually by a
certified technician to ensure their accuracy. Calibration records shall be
made available to the Town upon request.
      4.   Removal of Obstructions. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to
safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the User at the written or verbal request of the Town and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
User.
      5.   Unreasonable Delays. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town access
to the User's premises shall be a violation of this Article.
   B.   Search Warrants. If the Town has been refused access to a building,
structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Article, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the Town designed to verify compliance with this Article or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the Town may seek issuance of a
search warrant from the Prescott Valley Magistrate Court.
(Ord. No. 391, Enacted, 06/27/96; Ord. No. 510, Amended, 08/23/01)
9-05-140   Confidential Information.
Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit applications, industrial wastewater pretreatment
permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Town's inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction unless the
User specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Town, that the release of such information would be a misuse of public
records because it would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under the Arizona Open
Records law. Any such request must be asserted by the User at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
User furnishing a report that some or all of the information therein should be
held confidential, those portions of the report shall not be made available for
public inspection but the Town shall, instead, take reasonable steps in
accordance with State law to obtain an order closing those portions of the
record to inspection. However, nothing herein shall preclude the Town from
making such records available upon request to governmental agencies for uses
related to the APP or NPDES programs, the pretreatment program, or in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Note that
wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as
defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and

   A.   Types of Violation. Violations of this Article include, but are not
limited to, the following:
      1.   Exceeding Quantity Discharge Limitations. A User exceeding the
quantity discharge limitations as set forth herein or as made part of any
industrial wastewater pretreatment permit.
      2.   Discharging Excessive Concentrations. A User discharging or
permitting the discharge of excessive concentrations of substances limited by
this Article or any industrial wastewater pretreatment permit issued pursuant
to this Article.
      3.   Discharging Prohibited Substances. A User or other person
discharging or permitting the discharge of any substance prohibited by this
Article or by a permit issued pursuant to this Article.
      4.   Failure to Pay Charges. A Customer failing to pay any applicable
wastewater treatment charge established pursuant to this Article.
      5.   Knowing Misrepresentations. A Customer or User knowingly
misrepresenting or omitting any pertinent information from application permits
or reports required by this Article or by an industrial wastewater pretreatment
permit.
    B.   Responses to Noncompliance.  
      1.   Construction of an Inspection Manhole. If evidence of discharges of
prohibited substances or other violations of this Article is found, the Town
may require the construction of an inspection manhole at the expense of the
Customer and per the provisions of this Article.
      2.   Class 1 Misdemeanor. Except for failure to pay User fees and
charges, any violation of this Article shall constitute a Class 1 Misdemeanor,
and any such violation shall constitute a separate offense on each successive
day continued.
      3.   Discontinuance of Service. In addition to other remedies (civil and
criminal) available to it, the Town may discontinue wastewater treatment
services to any Customer or User who fails to comply with any provision of this
Article as otherwise provided in this Article for account delinquencies.
Discontinuance of services does not excuse payment of rates, fees, charges, or
penalties due under this Article.
      4.   Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
         a.   Notification of Violation. When the Town finds that a User has
violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this Article, an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town shall serve upon a
representative of the User (such representative meeting the criteria of
authorized signatory) a written Notice of Violation. Within five (5) days of
the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof (to include specific required
actions) shall be submitted by the User to the Town. Note that submission of
such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Also, nothing in
this subparagraph B(4) shall limit the authority of the Town to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a Notice of Violation.
         b.   Consent Orders. The Town may enter into Consent Orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the orders issued pursuant to this Article and shall
be judicially enforceable.
         c.   Show Cause Hearing. The Town may order a User which has violated
or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Town and show cause
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served
on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing.
Such notice shall be served on a representative of the User who meets the
criteria of an authorized signatory. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
         d.   Compliance Orders. When the Town finds that a User has violated
or continues to violate any provision of this Article, an industrial wastewater
pretreatment permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Town may issue an order to the User responsible
for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a
specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time
provided, wastewater service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the wastewater
treatment system. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a national pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
         e.   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Town finds that a User has
violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this Article, an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the User's past violations are
likely to recur, the Town may issue an order to the User directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the User to:
            (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
            (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
         f.   Administrative Fines.
            (1)   When the Town finds that a User has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this Article, an industrial wastewater pretreatment
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Town may fine such User in an amount not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation,
per day basis. The Town may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
            (2)   Unpaid fines shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. A
lien against the User's property (including but not limited to a judgment lien)
may be sought for unpaid fines.
            (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the Town to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Upon receipt of
such request, the Town Manager (or his/her designee) shall convene an
Administrative Review hearing on the matter as otherwise provided in this
Article. In the event the User's appeal is successful, the payment shall be
returned to the User.
            (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
         g.   Emergency Suspensions.  The Town may immediately suspend a User's
discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or property. The Town may also immediately suspend a User's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the wastewater system, or which presents or may present
an endangerment to the environment.
            (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Town
shall take such steps as deemed necessary (including immediate severance of the
wastewater service connection) to prevent or minimize damage to the wastewater
system or its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Town
shall allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Town that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in Subparagraph (B)(4)(h) herein are
initiated against the User.
            (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement to the Town within five (5) calendar days, describing the causes of
the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence.
      Nothing in Subsection
9-05-160(B) shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this subparagraph (B)(4)(g).
         h.   Termination of Discharge. Any User that violates the requirements
of this Article is subject to discharge termination. Such User will be notified
of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to
show cause under this Article why the proposed action should not be taken.
Exercise of this option by the Town shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User.
         i.   Administrative Review.  In the event of a dispute as to liability
for wastewater system rates, fees, charges, penalties or taxes (or the amount
of same), or the validity of proposed enforcement actions, a User may request
an administrative review.
            (1)   Request for Administrative Review. Requests must be received
by the Director at least five (5) business days prior to any deadline set for
(i) application of rates, fees, charges, penalties or taxes, or (ii)
enforcement actions. Requests may be made in writing, by facsimile
transmission, by telephone, by e-mail or in person, directed to the Office of
the Director at 7501 E. Civic Circle, Prescott Valley, Arizona 86314, (928)
759-3011 (ph.), (928) 759-5533 (fax), www.pvaz.net (website).
            (2)   Nature of Hearing. Within five (5) business days of receipt
of a request for administrative review, the Director shall arrange to meet with
the User or its representative. At the hearing, the User or its representative
may present their objection to the proposed rates, fees, charges, penalties,
taxes or enforcement action. The Director may schedule additional meetings, if
necessary.
            (3)   Decision. Within five (5) business days after the final
meeting with the User or its representative, the Director shall render a
decision in the matter, explaining the basis for the decision and the actions
that will be taken by the Director. A copy of the decision will be mailed
first-class, postage prepaid, to the User at the address provided by the User
on its account application.
            (4)   Appeal. Within five (5) business days from the date of the
Director’s decision, the User may appeal the Director’s decision to the Town
Manager. The Town Manager shall arrange to meet with the User or its
representative and the Director. At the hearing, the User or its representative
may present their objection to the proposed rates, fees, charges, penalties,
taxes or enforcement action. The Town Manager may schedule additional meetings,
if necessary. Within five (5) business days after the final meeting with the
User or its representative, the Town Manager shall issue a written
determination, which shall be final. The application of any rates, fees,
charges, penalties, taxes or enforcement action shall be tolled pending the
final determination of the Town Manager.
    5.   Judicial Enforcement Remedies.
         a.   Injunctive Relief. When the Town finds that a User has violated
(or continues to violate) any provision of this Article, an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town may petition the Yavapai County
Superior Court (through the Town's Attorney) for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the industrial wastewater pretreatment permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this Article on activities of the User. The Town may
also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
          b.   Civil Penalties.
            (1)   A User which has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this Article, an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
shall be liable to the Town for a maximum civil penalty of two thousand five
hundred dollars $2,500.00 per violation, per day.
            (2)   In addition to the above civil penalty, the Town may recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with
enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the
cost of any actual damages or fines incurred by the Town.
            (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the User's violation, corrective actions taken
by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor as
justice requires.
            (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
         c.   Criminal Prosecution.
            (1)   Except for failing to pay user fees and charges, Users that
willfully or negligently violate any provision of this Article, an industrial
wastewater pretreatment permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
Class 1 Misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not
more than six (6) months, or both.
            (2)   A User which has willfully or negligently introduced any
substance into the wastewater system which causes personal injury or property
damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a Class 1 Misdemeanor, punishable
by a fine of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) and/or
imprisonment for six (6) months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other
cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State
law. Furthermore, nothing herein shall preclude the Town from submitting such
violations to the County Attorney or other legal officer for prosecution of
other State or federal violations.
            (3)   A User that knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
Article, an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this Article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per violation per
day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.
         d.   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Article
are not exclusive. The Town may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the Town's enforcement response plan.
However, the Town may take other action against any User when the circumstances
warrant.
(Ord. No. 284, Enacted, 10/08/92; Ord. No. 391, Ren&Amd, 06/27/96, 9-05-100;
Ord. No. 510, Amended, 08/23/01; Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16)
9-05-170   Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
   A.   Upset.
      1.   Definition. For the purposes of this Subsection, "upset" means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond
the reasonable control of the User. An upset does not include noncompliance to
the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or
careless or improper operation.
      2.   Upset is Affirmative Defense in Specified Case. An upset shall
constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of Subparagraph A(3) are
met.
      3.   Basis For Affirmative Defense. A User who wishes to establish the
affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         a.   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         b.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         c.   The User has submitted the following information to the Town as
soon as possible but no later than twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days:
            (1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            (2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      4.   Burden of Proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      5.   Limitation on Judicial Determination. Users will have the
opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards.
      6.   Ability to Control Discharges in Event of Facility Failure. Users
shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or
failure of its treatment facility, until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   B.   Prohibited Discharge Standards.  A User shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
prohibitions in this Article if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference, and that either:
(a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or (b) no local limit exists but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when
the Town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   C.   Bypass.
      1.   Definitions. For the purposes of this Subsection,
         a.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a User's treatment facility.
         b.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      2.   Authorized Bypasses. A User may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this Subsection.
      3.   a.   Notice of Anticipated Bypass. If a User knows in advance of the
need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Town at least ten (10)
days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
         b.   Notice of Unanticipated Bypass. A User shall submit oral notice
to the Town of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards as soon as possible, but no later than twenty four (24) hours from
the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass.
The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause;
the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times; if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Town may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
      4.   a.   Exceptions to Enforcement Action. Bypasses are prohibited, and
the Town may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless
            (1)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            (3)   The User submitted notices as required under Subparagraph (3)
of this Subsection.
         b.   Authorization of Certain Anticipated Bypasses.  The Town may
approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the
Town determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subparagraph
(4)(a) of this Subsection.

9-05a-030   Domestic Water Fund Administration.
   A.   Establishment. A Domestic Water Fund is hereby established to account
for all revenues and expenditures of the Department in the operation of the
domestic water system. Nothing herein limits the authority of the Town, in
conformance with standard accounting and good financial management practices,
to establish other funds, subfunds, or accounts (i.e., debt service,
replacement, etc.) and to transfer monies between them and the water fund for
water service purposes and system administration purposes, or to make interfund
loans as allowed by law and approved by the Town Council.
   B.   Reserve Account. In the event debt financing is used to construct or
extend any portion of the domestic water system, a separate reserve account
shall be established and maintained in accordance with the terms of said
financing. The monies within said account may be used for emergency purposes in
accordance with the terms of said financing.
   C.   Additional Regulations. The Town Council shall adopt additional
regulations for Fund administration from time to time by resolution.

9-05a-040   Establishing Water Service.
   A.   Application. New domestic water service to any building, Unit,
structure, designated turf area, or water storage area on real property, or any
increase in the size of a water service connection to any building, Unit,
structure, designated turf area, or water storage area shall be initiated by
applications from Customers [or, in the case of the record owner(s) of real
property, their agent(s)] on forms established from time to time by the
Director. The information required at application and the consequences of
providing false information may be set from time to time by regulations adopted
by resolution.
   B.   Tenant Accounts. Applications by Customers who are Tenants must include
a copy of the lease or rental agreement for the property to be served. Tenants
applying for domestic water service to the leased/rental property shall be
responsible to pay all domestic water rates, fees, charges, and penalties
applicable to the property. Where residential property consisting of five or
more units is occupied by multiple Tenants, Tenants may apply for utility
service and place their name on accounts only if each Tenant of the property is
individually metered for domestic water.
   C.   Deposit. Applications for domestic water service shall be accompanied
by a deposit established from time to time by resolution, and administered in
accordance with regulations adopted from time to time by resolution. An
additional deposit may also be established by regulation from time to time in
cases of bankruptcy, as permitted under federal law.
   D.   Unauthorized Turn-On, Turn-Off, or Other Tampering. Except in emergency
circumstances, it shall be unlawful for any person to physically turn-on or
turn-off domestic water service to any building, Unit, structure, designated
turf area, or water storage area, to otherwise tamper with or damage the
domestic water system, or to direct, aid, or abet another in so doing without
the approval of the Director after compliance with established application
requirements. In lieu of criminal prosecution for such a misdemeanor violation,
the Director may (at his/her sole discretion) apply a civil penalty for such
violation, which penalty shall be set from time to time by resolution. The
Director may also waive any per-day aspect of such civil penalty in appropriate
circumstances, and provide for set-off of such penalties in return for payment
of the actual costs of any damages.

9-05a-045   Water Conservation.
   A.   The Mayor and the Town Manager are hereby authorized to declare Water
Conservation Levels, as set forth hereinafter, which shall have the effect of
restricting usage of water produced by the Town's domestic and reclaimed water
systems. Such Water Conservation Levels shall be based upon the Water Resource
Status Levels determined by the Utilities Director (or his designee) which, in
turn, are based upon the Utilities Director's assessment of the relationship
between water demand and safe water production capability. Safe water
production capability is defined as ninety percent (90%) of the total water
resources that can reasonably be produced through either the domestic water
system or the reclaimed water system, based upon distribution components,
storage reserves, weather conditions, and historic data.
   B.    Water Resource Status Levels are established as follows:
      1.   Status Level I: water demand is less than or equal to safe water
production capability.
      2.   Status Level II: water demand is greater than safe water production
capability for more than three (3) but less than fourteen (14) consecutive
days.
      3.    Status Level III: water demand is greater than safe water
production capability for fourteen (14) consecutive days or more.
      4.    Status Level IV: water demand is greater than the total water
resources that can reasonably be produced through either the domestic water
system or the reclaimed water system, based upon distribution components,
storage reserves, weather conditions, and historic data.
   C.    Water Conservation Levels are established as follows:
      1.   Conservation Level I (Water Awareness): water users are encouraged
to minimize waste when water is used for irrigation, vehicle and pavement
washing, construction, and similarly intensive water uses. Water Conservation
Level I may be declared by either the Town Manager or the Mayor.
      2.   Conservation Level II (Water Restrictions): water use is prohibited
or restricted as follows -
         a.   Irrigation, washing of vehicles, filling and refilling of
swimming pools, spas, and wading pools is restricted to Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, and Sunday for even-numbered addresses, and to Tuesday, Thursday,
Saturday, and Sunday for odd-numbered addresses.
         b.    Washing of vehicles is restricted to use of buckets and hoses
with positive cut-off nozzles, except that no restrictions apply to commercial
car washes, to washing of public safety vehicles, or to washing of vehicles for
specified public health, safety, or welfare reasons.
         c.    Washing of paved areas (e.g. drives, sidewalks and tennis
courts) is prohibited except for specified health, safety or welfare reasons.
         d.    Irrigation of golf courses is restricted to before Noon and
after 7 P.M. No restrictions apply if golf courses are irrigated with reclaimed
water.
         e.   Irrigation of landscaped areas is restricted to between 6 P.M.
and 10 P.M., and between 4 A.M. and 8 A.M. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday
for even-numbered addresses, and Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday for
odd-numbered addresses.
         f.    Operation of ornamental fountains is prohibited unless they are
equipped with recycling pumps.
         Water Conservation Level II may be declared by either the Town Manager
or the Mayor.
      3.   Conservation Level III (Water Emergency): water use is prohibited or
restricted as follows -
         a.    Filling and refilling of swimming pools, spas, and wading pools
is prohibited.
         b.    Irrigation of golf courses is prohibited, except that no
restrictions apply if golf courses are irrigated with reclaimed water.
         c.    Washing of vehicles and paved areas (e.g. drives, sidewalks and
tennis courts) is prohibited, except that no restrictions apply to commercial
car washes, to washing of public safety vehicles, or to washing of vehicles for
specified public health, safety, or welfare reasons.
         d.   Non-emergency use of hydrants is prohibited unless written
approval is first given by the Utilities Director for essential commercial
purposes.
         e.   Irrigation of landscaped areas is prohibited.
         f.    Operation of ornamental fountains is prohibited.
         Water Conservation Level III may only be declared by the Mayor.
      4.   Conservation Level IV (Water Crisis): water use is prohibited or
restricted as follows -
         a.    Filling or refilling of swimming pools, spas, and wading pools
is prohibited.
         b.    Irrigation of golf courses is prohibited.
         c.    Washing of vehicles and paved areas (e.g. drives, sidewalks and
tennis courts) is prohibited, except that no restrictions apply to washing of
public safety vehicles or to washing of vehicles for specified public health,
safety, or welfare reasons.
         d.   Non-emergency use of hydrants is prohibited.
         e.   Irrigation of landscaped areas is prohibited.
         f.    Operation of ornamental fountains is prohibited.
         g.    Compaction and dust control on construction projects is
prohibited, except that no restrictions apply to compaction and dust control
using reclaimed water.
         h.    Other water uses declared in writing by the Mayor to be unduly
consumptive are prohibited.
         Water Conservation Level IV may only be declared by the Mayor.
   D.   Water Conservation Levels are considered effective for all purposes
twenty-four (24) hours after posting of a writing declaring the same and signed
by the Town Manager or the Mayor (as the case may be) at the locations
established in accordance with ARS 38-431.02(A)(4), and after said writing has
been faxed, e-mailed or hand-delivered to a newspaper of general circulation
within the Town limits and to a radio station whose signal is generally
received within the Town limits.
   E.   Upon the effectiveness of a Water Conservation Level, water users shall
comply with the water use restrictions and prohibitions related thereto,
subject to the penalties set forth in Town Code
9-05a-100 hereinafter.
(Ord. No. 523, Enacted, 05/09/02; Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16; Ord. No.
839, Amended, 02/22/18; Ord. No. 2023-926, Amended, 11/09/23)
9-05a-050   Domestic Water Rates, Fees, Charges, and Penalties.
   A.   Classification of Users. For the purpose of applying domestic water
rates, fees, charges, and penalties, domestic water system Users shall be
classified into three (3) categories, as follows:
      1.   Residential. The residential classification shall include single
family homes and individual dwelling Units within multi-family residential
structures. A residential classification is not lost by reason of a "home
occupation" if water consumption is not significantly increased because of said
home occupation. Each dwelling Unit in a multi-family dwelling is considered a
separate residential User.
      2.   Commercial. The commercial classification shall include
institutional Users such as government entities, schools, churches, and
nonprofit organizations, as well as transient and group quarters (i.e., hotels/
motels, rooming houses, nursing homes, etc.). A residential unit located within
a structure utilized for commercial purposes or located on property used for
commercial purposes (i.e., mini-storage manager/caretaker residences, etc.)
shall be considered a separate commercial User for purposes of establishing
Base User Rates. Each separate or separately-metered commercial unit in a
structure or unified complex utilized for commercial purposes shall also be
considered a separate commercial User.
      3.   Industrial. The industrial User shall be any entity required to have
an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit under
Article 9-05 of the Town Code; otherwise it shall be classified as commercial.
Each separate or separately-metered industrial Unit in a structure or unified
complex utilized for industrial purposes shall be considered a separate
industrial User.
   B.   Water Rates, Fees, Charges, and Penalties. Water rates, fees, charges,
and penalties shall be set by resolution from time to time, in accordance with
the Intent and Scope of this Article and with applicable Arizona and federal
statutes.
      1.   Coordination with Other Fees and Assessments. Nothing herein shall
limit the authority of the Town to impose development fees in accordance with
ARS 9-463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time), or to
establish improvement district assessments per ARS 48-517 et seq. and fees in-
lieu of such assessments in order to upgrade or expand the domestic water
system. However, any Water System Connection Charges paid hereunder shall be
offset, in whole or in part, against any such fees and assessments in
accordance with law.
   C.   Billing. Billing of residential, commercial and industrial Customers
for domestic water services shall be accomplished as set forth from time to
time by regulations adopted by resolution.
      1.   Taxes. In addition to the domestic water rates, fees, charges, and
penalties established from time to time by resolution, domestic water billings
shall include any applicable taxes on the business of domestic water service.
      2.   Time Covered by Rates. With regard to domestic water rates, fees,
charges, penalties, and taxes, any Base User Rates are applied to the current
billing period while any Volume Rates and all other water rates, fees, charges,
penalties, and taxes are applied to the prior billing period.
      3.   Delinquency Dates. Water rates, fees, charges, penalties, and taxes
are due on different dates for different Customers based on billing cycles.
Such dates shall be specified for each Customer when service begins and shall
be set forth in the billings received. Payment is due twenty (20) days after
the billing date. Water rates, fees, charges, penalties, and taxes are
delinquent on the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the billing date. Nothing
herein shall preclude the Director from changing a Customer's billing period,
so long as adjustments are made in billings to reflect actual usage.
      4.   Consequences of Account Delinquencies. Account delinquencies in
relation to water rates, fees, charges, penalties, or taxes shall result in an
"Active Account Processing Charge", set from time to time by resolution, being
applied to the account on the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the billing date.
Furthermore, domestic water service will be subject to turn-off on and after
the fiftieth (50th) day after the billing date (unless emergency circumstances
justify immediate turn-off of domestic water service).
      5.   Application of Partial Payments. The application of partial payments
to delinquent accounts shall be established from time to time by regulations
adopted by resolution. Partial payments shall not avoid domestic water service
turn-off nor shall they renew domestic water service (except as specified in
any payment agreements).
      6.   Prepayments. Nothing herein shall preclude the Town from limiting
prepayments by regulations adopted from time to time by resolution.
      7.   Customer Inquiry Required. Failure of a Customer to receive any
monthly domestic water service billing or other communication from the Director
with regard to applicable water rates, fees, charges, penalties, or taxes shall
expressly not excuse the Customer from paying water rates, fees, charges,
penalties, or taxes due.
   D.   Delinquency Procedures. Procedures to be followed in the event of
account delinquencies shall be established from time to time by regulations
adopted by resolution. Such procedures shall include such enforcement measures
as are available to the Town in law and in equity (including, but expressly not
limited to, domestic water service turn-off), and shall provide for such notice
to Customers and opportunities for administrative hearings prior to application
of enforcement procedures (including, but not limited to, turn-off of domestic
water service) as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances and complies
with requirements of due process.
      1.   Payment Agreements. Nothing herein shall preclude the Director from
offering to enter into Payment Agreements with Customers who have delinquent
utility accounts at any stage of the enforcement process, as set forth from
time to time by regulations adopted by resolution.

9-05a-060   Domestic Water System Extensions.
   A.   Approval. The Town shall approve the design of, issue permits for, and
conduct inspections of all construction of water mains, water lines, and other
water system components that are to be attached to the Town's domestic water
system.
   B.   Design and Construction. The design and construction of all water
mains, water lines, and other water system components to be attached to the
Town's domestic water system must conform with good engineering practice,
including such standards as have been adopted from time to time by the Town
(i.e. the latest adopted technical building codes, the latest adopted
engineering standards, the current subdivision code, and the latest general
plan). As to size, in no case shall any water main be of a size less than six
inches (6") for residential areas and eight inches (8") for commercial and
industrial areas.
      The Town reserves the right to require an increase in size of water
mains, water lines, and other water system components constructed to be
attached to the Town's water system, in accordance with
Article 14-04 of the Town Code (as amended from time to time).
   C.   Inspection. In accordance with
Article 14-04 of the Town Code, all water mains, water lines, and other water
system components to be attached to the Town's domestic water system shall be
subject to inspection by the Town. Engineering plan review and inspection fees
may be charged as provided for in Chapter 16 of the Town Code.
   D.   Subdivisions. Extensions of the domestic water system into subdivisions
shall be regulated by
Article 14-04 of the Town Code.
   E.   Other Developments. All other developments requiring separate approval
by the Town shall construct extensions of the domestic water system, including
water mains, water lines, and related facilities, in accordance with the Towns
engineering standards, provided they are a reasonable distance from the water
system. The determination of what is a reasonable distance shall be made by the
Town, based on (1) the nature and size of uses proposed for the development,
(2)the capacity of existing domestic water mains and related facilities to
which any extension would be attached, and (3) other considerations deemed
appropriate by the Town.
      New developments which are determined by the Town to not be a reasonable
distance from the domestic water system may still be required, where
appropriate, to construct water mains, water lines, and related facilities
according to standards and specifications approved by the Town, in preparation
for future connection to the water system when it comes within a reasonable
distance.
   F.   Replacement or Repair. Persons or entities that build or cause to be
built any extensions of the domestic water system shall pay for any repairs or
replacements made necessary as a direct or indirect result of such
construction, including (for example) repair or replacement of curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, road surfaces, drainage structures, and utilities damaged or
disturbed during the building of water line extensions.
   G.   Coordination with Fees and Assessments. Nothing herein shall limit the
authority of the Town to impose development fees in accordance with ARS 9-
463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time), or to
establish improvement district assessments per ARS 48-571 et seq. and fees in-
lieu of such assessments in order to upgrade the Town's domestic water system.
However, such fees and assessments may be offset in whole or in part by the
value of construction to extend the system, in accordance with law.
(Ord. No. 386, Enacted, 07/11/96; Ord. No. 510, Amended, 08/23/01)
9-05a-070   Connections.
   A.   Water Service Connections Required. Every separate building, Unit,
structure, designated turf area, and water storage area to which domestic water
service is supplied shall have its own service connection. Unless otherwise
expressly permitted by the Department, it is unlawful for any Customer having a
domestic water service connection to supply or permit utility service to be
supplied through said connection to any other User, whether gratuitously or for
consideration. Domestic water supplied as part of utility service shall only be
delivered through meters supplied by the Town or by and through its third-
party contractors.
   For commercial properties, if a service connection has been included in the
main line for a particular adjacent lot, parcel or property, then connection to
the main line from any building, unit, structure, designated turf area, or
water storage area on that lot, parcel or property shall be at that service
connection. If a service connection has not been constructed in the mainline
for a particular adjacent lot, parcel or property, then connection from any
building, unit, structure, designated turf area, or water storage area on the
property must be at a location specified by the Town and the necessary service
connection must be constructed at the Customer’s expense.
      1.   Incidental Entry on Private Property. Department personnel are
expressly authorized at all reasonable times to incidentally enter upon private
property for the purpose of installing, reading, maintaining, and disconnecting
meters, and for the purpose of repairing and maintaining all components of the
domestic water system and for turning-on and turning-off domestic water
service.
   B.   Existing Developed Properties. All existing developed properties within
the appropriate distances established from time to time in the Town Code shall
connect to the Town's domestic water system at the record owner(s) expense
within ninety (90) days after the system is operational. If, as part of a
specific initial service plan for an area, the Town has assumed the
responsibility of providing connections to existing developed properties, this
time for connection may be extended until the Town makes (or would have made if
the property owner had given his or her timely written consent in a form
acceptable to the Town) the connection in conformance with the plan. All
connections shall be in accordance with the Town's Engineering Standards as
adopted from time to time.
      1.   When Water System is "Operational". A phase or portion of the
domestic water system is operational in an area (with regard to individual
lots, parcels, or properties) on either a) the date said lots, parcels or
properties would have been connected to the phase or portion of the domestic
water system had customers reasonably cooperated with the construction
contractor in order to be connected (i.e. had provided necessary construction
easements, assisted and permitted construction crews to construct necessary
service lines, permitted construction crews to actually connect appropriate
structures on the lot, parcel, or property to the water system, etc.), or b)
the date customers were told in writing was the date appropriate buildings,
Units, or structures on the lots, parcels or properties should be connected to
the water system.
      2.   Option for Contractor to Make Connections. If, as part of a specific
initial service plan for an area, the construction contractor assumes
responsibility for connecting existing developed properties to a phase or
portion of the domestic water system during construction [without cost to the
Customers], then the time for connection may be extended until the contractor
either makes the connection or would have made the connection if a) the
Customers had consented and cooperated as set forth hereinabove, or b) the
connection had not been outside the scope of the contractor's contract because
of physical barriers (however caused).
      3.   Default Connection by Customers. If Customers have not so consented
and cooperated, or if the connection is outside of the construction
contractor's contract (however caused), then said Customers must connect the
property at their own expense within the original ninety (90) days of domestic
water system availability.
      4.   Option to Set Later Connection Date. Nothing herein shall preclude
Department personnel, upon approval of the Town Council, from setting a later
date in writing for Customers to connect to the domestic water system.
      5.   Abandonment of Private Water Systems. In the event buildings, Units,
or structures on lots, parcels or properties with private water systems are
connected to a phase or portion of the domestic water system, the private water
systems must be abandoned within sixty (60) days after such connection, in
accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the Yavapai County Board
of Health, the Arizona Department of Health Services, and/or the Arizona
Department of Water Resources. Failure of Customers to properly abandon private
water systems within the time specified shall be reported to appropriate State
or County agencies, and Department personnel shall cooperate fully with such
agencies to abate the nuisance created by such failure.
         a.   Contractor Responsibility.  If, as part of a specific initial
service plan for an area, the construction contractor assumes responsibility
for connecting existing developed properties to the domestic water system
during construction (without cost to the Customers), and such plan includes
abandoning private water systems, then enforcement of this requirement may be
"tolled" until the contractor either abandons the private water systems in the
course of his contract or would have done so if i) the Customers had consented
and cooperated by providing necessary construction easements, permitting entry
onto property, etc., or ii) the abandonment were not outside the scope of the
contractor's contract because of physical barriers (however caused).
         b.   Customer Non-Cooperation. If i) Customers do not so consent and
cooperate by the time that a construction contractor is released from an area
by the Town (after having abandoned the other private water systems on lots,
parcels or properties in the area where permission had been granted and which
could reasonably be abandoned pursuant to contract), or ii) the abandonment is
outside of the construction contractor's contract (however caused) and
Customers do not themselves arrange to abandon their private water system in
accordance with the regulations within sixty (60) days of connection to the
domestic water system, then enforcement shall be sought by the Town as set
forth above.
            i.   Nothing herein shall preclude Department personnel, upon
approval of the Town Council, from setting a later date in writing for
Customers to abandon private water systems on their lots, parcels or
properties, prior to seeking enforcement as set forth above.
   C.   After-Developed Properties. All developments (including single family
dwellings) within the appropriate distance as set from time to time in the Town
Code from the Town's domestic water system which are to be approved for
occupancy after the water system is operational, shall be required to connect
to the water system at the expense of the record owner(s) before occupancy is
approved by the Town. All connections shall be in accordance with the Town's
Engineering Standards as adopted from time to time.
   D.   Permits and Inspections. No physical connection shall be made to the
domestic water system until a permit for the same has been acquired from the
Building Official in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Town Code (as amended
from time to time), after payment of all required fees and charges, unless the
connection is made by the Department. All connections shall conform to the
International Plumbing Code, as adopted and amended by the Town from time to
time. In addition to any other inspections, tests, and right-of-way permits
that may be required, inspection and approval of water system connections shall
be required before any trench or hole is backfilled. Any plan review and
inspection fee adopted from time to time by resolution may be waived under an
initial service plan where the connection is made by the Town or a contractor
that assumes responsibility for connecting existing developed properties during
construction without cost to the Customer.
      As part of any connection, an approved water meter must be installed by
the Department. The meters supplied may be changed from time to time as
technological advances provide for greater efficiency in domestic water
delivery and meter reading. Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the
Department, all such meters shall be located within an adjacent public right-
of-way, easement or license, and installed in accordance with the Engineering
Standards adopted from time to time by the Town. Such meters and meter boxes
shall not be obstructed in such a way as to prevent them from being accessed by
Department personnel for reading, maintenance and other purposes. Such water
meters are and remain part of the water system and are therefore property of
the Town.
   E.   Damage. In accordance with Town Code
7-10-030, any damage done to the domestic water system or to the public right-
of-way as a result of construction of a connection or any related construction
or excavation activity shall be repaired to the Town's satisfaction at the
constructing party's expense. The Town may require a bond of the party doing
such construction or excavation prior to the activity being undertaken.
      It is unlawful for any person to intentionally break, deface, tamper with
or damage any meter, hydrant, valve, line, pipe or other water system appliance
or fixture, or in any other manner to interfere with the operation of any part
of the domestic water system. Furthermore, it is unlawful for any person, with
intent to injure or defraud, to connect any pipe, line, tube or other
instrument with any water main, water line, or service line, whether or not
part of the water system, for conducting water supplied by the Town for the
purpose of taking such water without permission and/or payment.
   F.   Criminal Violation. The requirement that buildings, Units, structures,
designated turf areas, and water storage areas on lots, parcels or properties
be connected to the domestic water system (as set forth herein) is subject to
vigorous enforcement by all equitable and legal means available, including
civil and criminal actions against Customers. In this regard, failure to
connect to the domestic water system as set forth herein constitutes a class 1
misdemeanor (with each separate day being a separate offense).
      1.   Deferred Enforcement. Deferred enforcement or non-enforcement of
this requirement by the Town should not be construed as a waiver of future
enforcement with regard to the particular Customers and lots, parcels or
properties involved.
   G.   Related Assessments, Fees and Charges. In addition to any Water System
Connection Charges which may be applied from time to time by resolution, in
areas previously included within improvement districts created to extend the
domestic water system to such areas, if an assessment has not been previously
paid to the Town to make the water system available to a property (or if the
assessment paid for that property was not in proportion to payments made for
other similar properties, e.g. because of a property split, increased intensity
of development, etc.), a separate in-lieu of assessment fee, calculated to be
equivalent to the original assessment, may be imposed by the Town as a
condition of developing the property. Such in-lieu of assessment fee may be
established from time to time by resolution. Furthermore, development fees
pursuant to ARS 9-463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time) and Water
System Connection Charges may be imposed as a condition of developing the
property. However, any such assessments, fees and charges shall be subject to
mutual offset, in whole or in part, in accordance with law.

of-way in which they may be located.
   B.   Responsibility for Maintenance of Domestic Water System.  The
Department is generally responsible for the care and maintenance of the
domestic water system, including meters and all pipes, lines and other
facilities on the street side or right-of-way side of the meters. However,
Customers are responsible for the care and maintenance of their service lines
(and connections thereto), any private easements or rights-of-way in which they
may be located, and any internal water lines serving their properties.
   C.   Requirements Prior to Excavations. No Customer, User, or person shall
make or begin any excavation in any public street, alley, right-of-way
dedicated to public use, utility easement, or express or implied private
property utility easement included in the domestic water system without first
(1) determining whether utility system facilities (above-ground or underground)
will be encountered (and, if so, where they are located), and 2) taking
measures for control of the facilities in a careful and prudent manner. No
person shall begin excavating before the location of said facilities is marked
or he or she is notified that marking is unnecessary. Additional provisions
relating to excavation of public property shall be established from time to
time by regulations adopted by resolution.
   D.   Prohibition Against Damaging Domestic Water System. No Customer, User,

9-05a-080   Hydrants.
   A.   Hydrants for Domestic Water Supply. Customers [or, in the case of the
record owner(s) of real property, their agent(s)] may apply for limited
domestic water service through a hydrant (as described in Subsection D below)
by separate application on forms established from time to time by the Utilities
Director. Upon approval by the Department and payment of a deposit set from
time to time by resolution, a meter shall be installed on the hydrant from
which the water is to be supplied. Such deposit shall only be returned upon
return of the meter in operational condition. Customers shall thereafter be
responsible for paying all applicable Water Service Rates. No domestic water
service shall be obtained through a hydrant without use of backflow preventers
approved by applicable state or county agencies, and as set forth hereinafter
in Chapter VIII, Section 8.
   B.   Hydrant Locks. Hydrant meters are assigned to specific hydrants and may
not be moved to other hydrants without the permission of the Utilities
Director. Therefore, locks are placed upon hydrant meters for security purposes
and breaking of the same except by emergency services personnel in times of
emergency constitutes unauthorized tampering and is prohibited.
   C.   Unauthorized Tampering. Except in emergency circumstances, it shall be
unlawful to tamper with or damage a hydrant or hydrant meter, or to direct,
aid, or abet another in so doing, without the approval of the Utilities
Director after compliance with the above application requirements. In lieu of
criminal prosecution for such a misdemeanor violation, the Utilities Director
may (at his/her sole discretion) impose a civil penalty for such violation,
which penalty shall be set from time to time by resolution. The Utilities
Director may also waive any per-day aspect of such civil penalty in appropriate
circumstances and provide for set-off of such penalties in return for payment
of the actual costs of any damages.
   D.   Limited Use. Domestic water supply through a hydrant may only be used
for temporary construction activities occurring within the Town limits. Any use
of domestic water supply through a hydrant for other purposes on the date this
restriction became effective may continue for up to three (3) years to the
extent said usage otherwise complies with this Chapter and related regulations.
In the event no domestic water supply is used through a particular hydrant for
any sixty- (60) day period, the hydrant meter shall be subject to removal by
the Town and the service account closed. Thereafter, an account for domestic
water supply through that hydrant may only be reopened for purposes consistent
with this Subsection. Nothing herein shall prevent water being supplied through
a hydrant for temporary special events sponsored or permitted by the Town, use
by the Town or its contractors for such things as street cleaning, dust
control, and sewer system cleaning, or for emergencies.

9-05a-085   Water Fill Stations.
   A.   Water Fill Stations for Domestic Water Supply. Persons may use water
fill stations constructed and operated by the Town for domestic water supply
without formal application or separate service account (but on a first-come
first-served basis during such times and by such means as may be established
from time to time by the Department, and upon payment of fees established by
the Town Council).
   B.   Unauthorized Tampering. Except in emergency circumstances, it shall be
unlawful to tamper with or damage a water fill station, or to direct, aid, or
abet another in so doing, without the approval of the Utilities Director. In
lieu of criminal prosecution for such a misdemeanor violation, the Utilities
Director may (at his/her sole discretion) impose a civil penalty for such
violation, which penalty shall be set from time to time by resolution. The
Utilities Director may also waive any per-day aspect of such civil penalty in
appropriate circumstances and provide for set-off of such penalties in return
for payment of the actual costs of any damages.

9-05a-090   Cross-Connection Control Program.
   A.   Coordination with International Plumbing Code and the Arizona
Administrative Code. In addition to the applicable provisions of the
International Plumbing Code (as adopted and amended from time to time in
Chapter 7 "BUILDING" of the Town Code) and Title 18, Chapter 4 of the Arizona
Administrative Code, the provisions of this Section shall constitute a Cross-
Connection Control Program for the Town. In the event of a conflict between the
provisions of this Section and those of the International Plumbing Code and/or
the Arizona Administrative Code, the provisions of this Section shall apply.
   B.   Program Goal. The goal of the cross-connection control program is to
protect the Town's domestic water supply from the possibility of contamination
or pollution by isolating within users' systems such contaminants or pollutants
as might backflow into the domestic water supply. The program shall provide for
the monitoring and enforcement of a continuing program of backflow prevention
designed to prevent the contamination or pollution of the domestic water
supply.
   C.   Program Implementation. This cross-connection control program shall be
implemented as follows:
      1.   New Construction. With the adoption of this cross-connection control
program, all commercial/industrial new construction, additions, remodeling, or
tenant improvements on any property shall be evaluated to determine if a
backflow prevention assembly (BFPA) or air gap is required. If it is determined
that the property requires a BFPA or air gap, construction thereof shall be in
accordance with the engineering standards adopted from time to time in Article
16-01 of the Town Code.
      2.   Retrofit of Existing Construction. If the Town is alerted, by any
means, to potential backflow hazards involving existing properties, the
Customer shall install a BFPA or air gap in accordance with the cross-
connection control program. Retrofits shall be completed by a certified and
licensed contractor approved by the Town within 3 months from the date the Town
notifies the Customer. Customers are responsible to pay all costs for labor and
materials incurred to complete a retrofit.
      3.   Secondary Source of Water. If a secondary water supply is connected
to a customer system that is also served by the Town’s domestic water system,
the secondary connection shall be mechanically disconnected or, in the
alternative, a BFPA shall be installed. In the event the Customer fails to
disconnect the secondary water supply or install a BFPA, the Town shall
discontinue the domestic water service to the customer until such time as the
secondary water supply has been disconnected or a BFPA has been installed. The
Customer shall pay any and all charges associated with disconnecting and/or
reconnecting to the domestic water system.
      4.    Branching. Assemblies on a metered service shall be located
downstream of the meter before branching. On non-metered service, assembly
shall be located downstream of any branching.
      5.    Submergence. Assemblies shall be located above ground in an area
free from submergence or flood potential.
      6.    Concrete Enclosure Pad. The concrete pad shall be constructed above
final grade to help prevent eroded soil from obstructing enclosure drains.
      7.    Costs. All costs to purchase, install, operate, maintain, replace
and test BFPAs and air gaps are the responsibility of the customer.
      8.   Water Pressure and Volume. Any water pressure drop or loss of volume
caused by the installation of a BFPA or air gap is not the responsibility of
the Department.
      9.    Permits. Building permits will not be issued until all BFPAs and/or
air gaps have been specified and located on a plan approved by the Water
Department.
      10.    Prohibited Locations. Assemblies must not be located in traffic
visibility triangles or where utility devices are prohibited by Town Code.

less than one (1) inch.
      2.   "Backflow" means a reverse flow condition that causes water or
mixtures of water and other liquids, gases, or substances to flow back into the
distribution system. Backflow can be created by a difference in water pressure
(backpressure), a vacuum or partial vacuum (backsiphonage), or a combination of
both.
      3.   ”Backflow Prevention Assembly (BFPA)” means an assembly or means
designed to prevent the reversal of the normal flow caused by either
backpressure or backsiphonage.
      4.   "BFPA Tester" means any person who has proven his/her competency to
the satisfaction of the Department, is certified to install, make competent
tests or repair, overhaul and make reports on backflow prevention assemblies,
and who is conversant with applicable laws, rules and regulations, has had
experience in plumbing or pipe fitting, or has other qualifications which are
equivalent in the opinion of the Department.
      5.   "Double Check Valve Assembly" means an assembly of two (2)

defects are corrected.
   M.   Existing Devices and Users. If the Department determines that a User's
backflow preventive assembly does not meet applicable Engineering Standards,
the User shall retrofit, replace or repair the assembly so that it meets the
standards. Whenever it is determined by the Department that a water service
poses an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the domestic
water system or to the potability of the water system, an assembly complying
with this program must be installed. The cost of installation, testing and
maintenance shall be borne by the User.
   N.   Disclaimer of Liability. This cross-connection control program shall
not create any duty or liability on the part of the Town of Prescott Valley,
its officers, employees, agents or successors.

is prohibited.
         b.    Irrigation of golf courses is prohibited, except that no
restrictions apply if golf courses are irrigated with reclaimed water.
         c.    Washing of vehicles and paved areas (e.g. drives, sidewalks and
tennis courts) is prohibited, except that no restrictions apply to commercial
car washes, to washing of public safety vehicles, or to washing of vehicles for
specified public health, safety, or welfare reasons.
         d.   Non-emergency use of hydrants is prohibited unless written
approval is first given by the Utilities Director for essential commercial
purposes.
         e.   Irrigation of landscaped areas is prohibited.
         f.    Operation of ornamental fountains is prohibited.
         Water Conservation Level III may only be declared by the Mayor.
      4.   Conservation Level IV (Water Crisis): water use is prohibited or

twenty-four (24) hours after posting of a writing declaring the same and signed
by the Town Manager or the Mayor (as the case may be) at the locations
established in accordance with ARS §38-431.02(A)(4), and after said writing has
been faxed, e-mailed or hand-delivered to a newspaper of general circulation
within the Town limits and to a radio station whose signal is generally
received within the Town limits.
   E.   Upon the effectiveness of a Water Conservation Level, water users shall
comply with the water use restrictions and prohibitions related thereto,
subject to the penalties set forth in Town Code
9-05b-100 hereinafter.
(Ord. No. 523, Enacted, 05/09/02; Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16; Ord. No.
839, Amended, 02/22/18; Ord. No. 2023-926, Amended, 11/09/23)
9-05b-050   Reclaimed Water Rates, Fees, Charges, and Penalties.
   A.   Classification of Users. For the purpose of applying reclaimed water
rates, fees, charges, and penalties, reclaimed water system Users shall be
classified into three (3) categories, as follows:
      1.    Residential. The residential classification shall include single
family homes and individual dwelling Units within multi-family residential
structures. A residential classification is not lost by reason of a "home
occupation" if water consumption is not significantly increased because of said
home occupation. Each dwelling Unit in a multi-family dwelling is considered a
separate residential User.
      2.    Commercial. The commercial classification shall include
institutional Users such as government entities, schools, churches, and
nonprofit organizations, as well as transient and group quarters (i.e., hotels/
motels, rooming houses, nursing homes, etc.). A residential unit located within
a structure utilized for commercial purposes or located on property used for
commercial purposes (i.e., mini-storage manager/caretaker residences, etc.)
shall be considered a separate commercial User. Each separate or separately-
metered commercial unit in a structure or unified complex utilized for
commercial purposes shall also be considered a separate commercial User.
      3.    Industrial. The industrial User shall be any entity required to
have an industrial wastewater pretreatment permit under
Article 9-05 of the Town Code; otherwise it shall be classified as commercial.
Each separate or separately-metered industrial Unit in a structure or unified
complex utilized for industrial purposes shall be considered a separate
industrial User.
   B.   Reclaimed Water Rates, Fees, Charges, and Penalties. Reclaimed water
rates, fees, charges, and penalties shall be set by resolution from time to
time, in accordance with the Intent and Scope of this Article and with
applicable Arizona and federal statutes.
      1.   Coordination with Other Fees and Assessments. Nothing herein shall
limit the authority of the Town to impose development fees in accordance with
ARS 9-463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time), or to
establish improvement district assessments per ARS 48- 517 et seq. and fees in-
lieu of such assessments in order to upgrade or expand the reclaimed water
system.
   C.    Billing. Billing of residential, commercial and industrial Customers
for reclaimed water services shall be accomplished as set forth from time to
time by regulations adopted by resolution.
      1.    Taxes. In addition to the reclaimed water rates, fees, charges, and
penalties established from time to time by resolution, reclaimed water billings
shall include any applicable taxes on the business of reclaimed water service.
      2.   Time Covered by Rates. With regard to reclaimed water rates, fees,
charges, penalties, and taxes, Volume Rates and all other reclaimed water
rates, fees, charges, penalties, and taxes are applied to the prior billing
period.
      3.    Delinquency Dates. Reclaimed water rates, fees, charges, penalties,
and taxes are due on different dates for different Customers based on billing
cycles. Such dates shall be specified for each Customer when service begins and
shall be set forth in the billings received. Payment is due twenty (20) days
after the billing date. Reclaimed water rates, fees, charges, penalties, and
taxes are delinquent on the twenty-eight (28th) day after the billing date.
Nothing herein shall preclude the Director from changing a Customer's billing
period, so long as adjustments are made in billings to reflect actual usage.
      4.   Consequences of Account Delinquencies. Account delinquencies in
relation to reclaimed water rates, fees, charges, penalties, or taxes shall
result in an "Active Account Processing Charge", set from time to time by
resolution, being applied to the account on the twenty-eighth (28th) day after
the billing date. Furthermore, reclaimed water service will be subject to turn-
off on and after the fiftieth (50th) day after the billing date (unless
emergency circumstances justify immediate turn-off of reclaimed water service).
      5.   Application of Partial Payments. The application of partial payments
to delinquent accounts shall be established from time to time by regulations
adopted by resolution. Partial payments shall not avoid reclaimed water service
turn-off nor shall they renew reclaimed water service (except as specified in
any payment agreements).
      6.    Prepayments. Nothing herein shall preclude the Town from limiting
prepayments by regulations adopted from time to time by resolution.
      7.    Customer Inquiry Required. Failure of a Customer to receive any
monthly reclaimed water service billing or other communication from the
Director with regard to applicable reclaimed water rates, fees, charges,
penalties, or taxes shall expressly not excuse the Customer from paying
reclaimed water rates, fees, charges, penalties, or taxes due.
   D.    Delinquency Procedures. Procedures to be followed in the event of
account delinquencies shall be established from time to time by regulations
adopted by resolution. Such procedures shall include such enforcement measures
as are available to the Town in law and in equity (including, but expressly not
limited to, reclaimed water service turn-off), and shall provide for such
notice to Customers and opportunities for administrative hearings prior to
application of enforcement procedures (including, but not limited to, turn-off
of reclaimed water service) as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances
and complies with requirements of due process.
      1.    Payment Agreements. Nothing herein shall preclude the Director from
offering to enter into Payment Agreements with Customers who have delinquent
utility accounts at any stage of the enforcement process, as set forth from
time to time by regulations adopted by resolution.

667, Amended, 09/28/06; Ord. No. 815, Amended, 04/28/16)
9-05b-060   Reclaimed Water System Extensions.
   A.    Approval. The Town shall approve the design of, issue permits for, and
conduct inspections of all construction of reclaimed water mains, reclaimed
water lines, and other reclaimed water system components that are to be
attached to the Town's reclaimed water system.
   B.   Design and Construction. The design and construction of all reclaimed
water mains, reclaimed water lines, and other reclaimed water system components
to be attached to the Town's reclaimed water system must conform with good
engineering practice, including such standards as have been adopted from time
to time by the Town (i.e. the latest adopted technical building codes, the
latest adopted engineering standards, the current subdivision code, and the
latest general plan).
      The Town reserves the right to require an increase in size of reclaimed
water mains, reclaimed water lines, and other reclaimed water system components
constructed to be attached to the Town's reclaimed water system, in accordance
with
Article 14-04 of the Town Code (as amended from time to time).
   C.    Inspection. In accordance with
Article 14-04 of the Town Code, all reclaimed water mains, reclaimed water
lines, and other reclaimed water system components to be attached to the Town's
reclaimed water system shall be subject to inspection by the Town. Engineering
plan review and inspection fees may be charged as provided for in Chapter 16 of
the Town Code.
   D.    Subdivisions. Extensions of the reclaimed water system into
subdivisions shall be regulated by
Article 14-04 of the Town Code.
   E.    Other Developments. All other developments requiring separate approval
by the Town shall construct extensions of the reclaimed water system, including
reclaimed water mains, reclaimed water lines, and related facilities, in
accordance with the Towns engineering standards, provided they are a reasonable
distance from the reclaimed water system. The determination of what is a
reasonable distance shall be made by the Town, based on (1) the nature and size
of uses proposed for the development, (2) whether service can be provided by
gravity flow or requires pump stations, (3) the capacity of existing reclaimed
water mains and related facilities to which any extension would be attached,
and (4) other considerations deemed appropriate by the Town.
      New developments which are determined by the Town to not be a reasonable
distance from the reclaimed water system may still be required, where
appropriate, to construct reclaimed water mains, reclaimed water lines, and
related facilities according to standards and specifications approved by the
Town, in preparation for future connection to the reclaimed water system when
it comes within a reasonable distance.
   F.   Replacement or Repair.  Persons or entities that build or cause to be
built any extensions of the reclaimed water system shall pay for any repairs or
replacements made necessary as a direct or indirect result of such
construction, including (for example) repair or replacement of curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, road surfaces, drainage structures, and utilities damaged or
disturbed during the building of reclaimed water line extensions.
   G.   Coordination with Fees and Assessments. Nothing herein shall limit the
authority of the Town to impose development fees in accordance with ARS § 9-
463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time), or to
establish improvement district assessments per ARS § 48-571 et seq. and fees
in-lieu of such assessments in order to upgrade the Town's reclaimed water
system. However, such fees and assessments may be offset in whole or in part by
the value of construction to extend the system, in accordance with law.
(Ord. No. 510, Enacted, 08/23/01)
9-05b-070   Connections.
   A.   Reclaimed Water Service Connections Required. Every separate building,
Unit, structure, designated turf area, and water storage area to which
reclaimed water service is supplied shall have its own service connection.
Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the Department, it is unlawful for any
Customer having a reclaimed water service connection to supply or permit
utility service to be supplied through said connection to any other User,
whether gratuitously or for consideration. Reclaimed water supplied as part of
utility service shall only be delivered through meters supplied by the Town (by
and through its third-party contractors).
      1.   Incidental Entry on Private Property. Department personnel are
expressly authorized at all reasonable times to incidentally enter upon private
property for the purpose of installing, reading, maintaining, and disconnecting
meters, and for the purpose of repairing and maintaining all components of the
reclaimed water system and for turning-on and turning-off reclaimed water
service.
   B.   Permits and Inspections. No physical connection shall be made to the
reclaimed water system until a permit for the same has been acquired from the
Building Official in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Town Code (as amended
from time to time), after payment of all required fees and charges, unless the
connection is made by the Department. All connections shall conform to the
International Plumbing Code, as adopted and amended by the Town from time to
time. In addition to any other inspections, tests, and right-of-way permits
that may be required, inspection and approval of reclaimed water system
connections shall be required before any trench or hole is backfilled.
      As part of any connection, an approved reclaimed water meter must be
installed by the Department. The meters supplied may be changed from time to
time as technological advances provide for greater efficiency in domestic water
delivery and meter reading. Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the
Department, all such meters shall be located within an adjacent public right-
of-way, easement or license, and installed in accordance with the Engineering
Standards adopted from time to time by the Town. Such meters and meter boxes
shall not be obstructed in such a way as to prevent them from being accessed by
Department personnel for reading, maintenance and other purposes. Such
reclaimed water meters are and remain part of the reclaimed water system and
are therefore property of the Town.
   C.    Damage. In accordance with Town Code
7-10-030, any damage done to the reclaimed water system or to the public right-
of-way as a result of construction of a connection or any related construction
or excavation activity shall be repaired to the Town's satisfaction at the
constructing party's expense. The Town may require a bond of the party doing
such construction or excavation prior to the activity being undertaken.
      It is unlawful for any person to intentionally break, deface, tamper with
or damage any meter, hydrant, valve, line, pipe or other reclaimed water system
appliance or fixture, or in any other manner to interfere with the operation of
any part of the reclaimed water system. Furthermore, it is unlawful for any
person, with intent to injure or defraud, to connect any pipe, line, tube or
other instrument with any reclaimed water main, reclaimed water line, or
service line, whether or not part of the reclaimed water system, for conducting
reclaimed water supplied by the Town for the purpose of taking such reclaimed
water without permission and/or payment.
   D.   Related Assessments, Fees and Charges. In areas previously included
within improvement districts created to extend the reclaimed water system to
such areas, if an assessment has not been previously paid to the Town to make
the reclaimed water system available to a property (or if the assessment paid
for that property was not in proportion to payments made for other similar
properties, e.g. because of a property split, increased intensity of
development, etc.), a separate in-lieu of assessment fee, calculated to be
equivalent to the original assessment, may be imposed by the Town as a
condition of developing the property. Such in-lieu of assessment fee may be
established from time to time by resolution. Furthermore, development fees
pursuant to ARS §9-463.05 and
Article 7-11 of the Town Code (all as amended from time to time) and reclaimed
water system connection charges may be imposed as a condition of developing the
property. However, any such assessments, fees and charges shall be subject to
mutual offset, in whole or in part, in accordance with law.

   A.   Facilities Included in Reclaimed Water System. The reclaimed water
system includes (but is expressly not limited to) recharge wells, treatment
facilities, pumps, booster stations, storage tanks, storage ponds, mains,
lines, hydrants, valves, and meters, as well as any public rights-of-way,
easements (express or implied), or licenses within which they are located (but
expressly not including service lines and connections thereto located on the
Customer side of meters). "Mains" include all pipe larger than six inches (6")
in diameter and "service taps" between such pipes and meters. The reclaimed
water system expressly does not include service lines and connections thereto
from buildings, Units, structures, designated turf areas, or water storage
areas out to meters, or any private easements or rights-of-way in which they
may be located.
   B.   Responsibility for Maintenance of Reclaimed Water System. The
Department is generally responsible for the care and maintenance of the
reclaimed water system, including meters and all pipes, lines and other
facilities on the street side or right-of-way side of the meters. However,
Customers are responsible for the care and maintenance of their service lines
(and connections thereto), any private easements or rights-of-way in which they
may be located, and any internal lines serving their properties.
   C.   Requirements Prior to Excavations. No Customer, User, or person shall
make or begin any excavation in any public street, alley, right-of-way
dedicated to public use, utility easement, or express or implied private
property utility easement included in the reclaimed water system without first
(1) determining whether utility system facilities (above-ground or underground)
will be encountered (and, if so, where they are located), and 2) taking
measures for control of the facilities in a careful and prudent manner. No
person shall begin excavating before the location of said facilities is marked
or he or she is notified that marking is unnecessary. Additional provisions
relating to excavation of public property shall be established from time to
time by regulations adopted by resolution.
   D.   Prohibition Against Damaging Reclaimed Water System. No Customer, User,
or person shall knowingly or negligently damage the reclaimed water system
(including, but expressly not limited to, damage caused by improper connection
to the reclaimed water system and negligent excavation or other construction
in, on, or around the reclaimed water system).
      1.    Enforcement Options. Knowing or negligent damage to the reclaimed
water system is subject to vigorous pursuit of any and all remedies available
to the Town, including (but expressly not limited to) injunction, abatement,
turn-off of service, actions for damages, civil penalties, and criminal
penalties. [Note: exemption from civil penalty or liability for gardening or
tilling with hand tools on own property; ARS § 40-360.28(F)(3)] Procedures for
turning-off reclaimed water service in the event of damage to the reclaimed
water system shall be established from time to time by regulations adopted by
resolution.

9-05b-090   Hydrants.
   A.   Hydrants for Reclaimed Water Supply. Customers [or, in the case of the
record owner(s) of real property, their agent(s)] may apply for limited
reclaimed water service through a hydrant (where applicable, as described in
Subsection D below) by separate application on forms established from time to
time by the Utilities Director. Upon approval by the Department and payment of
a deposit set from time to time by resolution, a meter shall be installed on
the hydrant from which the reclaimed water is to be supplied. Such deposit
shall only be returned upon return of the meter in operational condition.
Customers shall thereafter be responsible for paying all applicable Reclaimed
Water Rates.
   B.    Hydrant Locks. Hydrant meters are assigned to specific hydrants and
may not be moved to other hydrants without the permission of the Utilities
Director. Therefore, locks are placed upon hydrant meters for security purposes
and breaking of the same except by emergency services personnel in times of
emergency constitutes unauthorized tampering and is prohibited.
   C.    Unauthorized Tampering. Except in emergency circumstances, it shall be
unlawful to tamper with or damage a hydrant or hydrant meter, or to direct,
aid, or abet another in so doing without the approval of the Utilities Director
after compliance with the above application requirements. In lieu of criminal
prosecution for such a misdemeanor violation, the Utilities Director may (at
his/her sole discretion) impose a civil penalty for such violation, which
penalty shall be set from time to time by resolution. The Utilities Director
may also waive any per-day aspect of such civil penalty in appropriate
circumstances and provide for set-off of such penalties in return for payment
of the actual costs of any damages.
   D.    Limited Use. Reclaimed water supply through a hydrant may only be used
for temporary construction activities occurring within the Town limits. Any use
of reclaimed water supply through a hydrant for other purposes on the date this
restriction became effective may continue for up to three (3) years to the
extent said usage otherwise complies with this Chapter and related regulations.
In the event no reclaimed water supply is used through a particular hydrant for
any sixty- (60) day period, the hydrant meter shall be subject to removal by
the Town and the service account closed. Thereafter, an account for reclaimed
water supply through that hydrant may only be reopened for purposes consistent
with this Subsection. Nothing herein shall prevent reclaimed water being
supplied through a hydrant for temporary special events sponsored or permitted
by the Town, use by the Town or its contractors for such things as street
cleaning, dust control, and sewer system cleaning, or for emergencies.

9-05b-095   Water Fill Stations.
   A.   Water Fill Stations for Reclaimed Water Supply. Persons may use water
fill stations constructed and operated by the Town for reclaimed water supply
without formal application or separate service account (but on a first-come
first-served basis during such times and by such means as may be established
from time to time by the Department, and upon payment of fees established by
the Town Council).
   B.    Unauthorized Tampering. Except in emergency circumstances, it shall be
unlawful to tamper with or damage a water fill station, or to direct, aid, or
abet another in so doing, without the approval of the Utilities Director. In
lieu of criminal prosecution for such a misdemeanor violation, the Utilities
Director may (at his/her sole discretion) impose a civil penalty for such
violation, which penalty shall be set from time to time by resolution. The
Utilities Director may also waive any per-day aspect of such civil penalty in
appropriate circumstances and provide for set-off of such penalties in return
for payment of the actual costs of any damages.

9-05b-100   Penalties and Remedies.
   A.   Violations a Class 1 Misdemeanor. Except for failure to pay reclaimed
water rates, fees, charges, and penalties, any violation of this Article shall
constitute a class 1 misdemeanor, and any such violation shall constitute a
separate offense on each successive day it is continued.
   B.   Turning-Off Reclaimed Water Service. In addition to other remedies
(civil or criminal) available to it, the Town of Prescott Valley may turn-off
reclaimed water services to any Customer or User who fails to comply with any
provision of this Article (including non-payment of rates, fees, charges,
penalties, and taxes) as provided in this Article. Turning-off of reclaimed
water services does not excuse failure to pay applicable rates, fees, charges,
penalties, and taxes due under this Article.

      4.   Consequences of Account Delinquencies. Account delinquencies in
relation to stormwater rates, fees, charges, penalties, or taxes shall result
in an "Active Account Processing Charge", set from time to time by resolution,
being applied to the account on the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the billing

utility accounts at any stage of the enforcement process, as set forth from
time to time by regulations adopted by resolution.

9-07-005   Purpose and Findings.
Based on information, studies and court decisions from other jurisdictions, the
Prescott Valley Town Council makes the following legislative findings and
statement of purpose:
The Council recognizes that some activities which occur in connection with
sexually-oriented businesses are protected as expression under the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Council further recognizes
that First Amendment rights are among the most precious and highly protected
rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights.
The Council is aware, however, that sexually-oriented businesses may and do
generate secondary effects which are detrimental to the public health, safety,
and welfare. Among these secondary effects are (a) prostitution and other sex
related offenses (b) drug use and dealing (c) health risks through the spread
of AIDS and other sexually- transmitted diseases and (d) infiltration by
organized crime for the purpose of drug and sex related business activities,
laundering of money, and other illicit conduct. This Article is not intended to
interfere with legitimate expression but to avoid and mitigate the secondary
effects enumerated above. Specifically, the Council finds that licensing of
persons who operate and manage sexually-oriented businesses and persons who
provide adult services will further the goals of this Article by enabling the
Town to ascertain if an applicant is underage or has engaged in criminal or
other behavior of the sort that this Article is design to limit. This
information will enable the Town to allocate law enforcement resources
effectively and otherwise protect the community. The Council finds that
limiting proximity and contact between adult service providers and patrons
promotes the goal of reducing prostitution and other casual sexual conduct and
the attendant risk of sexually-transmitted diseases. The Council finds the
foregoing to be true with respect to places where alcohol is served and where
it is not. The Council finds that individual and interactive sexual activities
in adult video facilities pose a risk of sexually-transmitted disease,
especially AIDS, and that the booth configuration options of this Article will
reduce that risk. The Council finds that the harmful secondary effects of
sexually-oriented businesses are more pronounced when conducted continuously or
during late night hours. The fees established for licenses and permits in this
Article are based on the estimated cost of implementation, administration, and
enforcement of the licensing program.

The Town of Prescott Valley recognizes the threat to the public health, safety,
peace and welfare of its citizens caused by inadequately supervised loud or
unruly parties where alcohol and/or illegal drugs are served to, consumed by,
or in the possession of underage persons. Youth who drink alcohol may
experience among other things, trouble at school, alcohol-related car crashes,
high risk sexual activity and alcohol poisoning. The service to and consumption
of alcohol by minors at such parties may also significantly disrupt citizens
quiet enjoyment of their households, especially in residential neighborhoods.
The purpose of this Article is to deter nuisance parties by targeting the
persons responsible for repeatedly hosting nuisance parties and allowing
underage persons to consume alcohol or drugs on their premises.

lawful occupants of the posted premises, the court shall set only one (1)
hearing and shall consolidate the petitions and notify all petitioners of the
hearing date and time. At the hearing, the Town has the burden of proving by a

pursuant to the provisions of this Article.

mailing of the notice, may petition the court for an order directing the
removal of the notice on the grounds that the owner has taken responsible and
necessary actions, such as evicting a tenant responsible for the violation, to
prevent the occurrence of a subsequent nuisance party at the posted location.
The court shall set a time and date for a hearing to be held no later than
fifteen days after receipt of the petition and shall notify both the petitioner
and the town prosecutor of the hearing date. At the hearing, the petitioner has
the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she has
taken reasonable and necessary actions to prevent the occurrence of a
subsequent nuisance party. This petition process is not available to an owner
who was present at the nuisance party and engaged in conduct causing the
gathering to be a nuisance as defined herein.

This Article is intended to regulate the activities and responsibilities of
those persons who purchase, own, lease or rent alarm systems and those persons
who own or operate businesses that monitor or service alarms or alarm systems.

10-05-020    Definitions.
For the purposes of this Article, the following terms, phrases, words, and
their derivations shall have the meanings given herein.

corporation, or other form of association that engages in business or accepts
employment to install, maintain, alter, sell on premises, monitor, or service
Burglar, Robbery or Panic Alarms or other Alarm Systems located in the Town of

limits of Prescott Valley which monitor alarms installed within the town
limits. Neither the Town nor its police department is an Alarm Company
Operator.
   D.    "Alarm Administrator". Any person, persons, company or independent

burglary, unauthorized entry (or attempted entry), or property damage which,
when activated, automatically or intentionally, generates an inaudible signal
to a central monitoring station designed to alert or cause to be alerted police
department personnel to an emergency situation occurring to or against an
individual or premises. A Burglary Alarm may also generate an audible sound on
the premises.
   I.    "Cancellation". The process where police response is terminated when
the alarm business or other responsible person (as designated by the Alarm
System User) notifies police dispatch that there is not an existing situation
at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If
Cancellation occurs prior to police arrival at the scene, this shall not be
considered a False Alarm for the purpose of this Article and no assessment
shall be charged.
   J.    "Common Cause". A common technical difficulty or malfunction which
causes an Alarm System to generate a series of False Alarms, all of which occur
within a twenty-four (24) hour period. The series of False Alarms shall be

by the Alarm System User.
   L.     "Person". Any individual, corporation, partnership, incorporated
association or other legal entity.
   M.    "Proprietary Alarm System". An Alarm System exclusively owned by an
individual or corporation that is (1) not rented, leased, installed,
maintained, monitored or serviced by an alarm business; (2) does not emit an
Audible Alarm; and (3) to which response is provided solely by the user or his
or her own security force.
   N.    "Responder". A private guard, alarm company guard, private entity, or
person who verifies that there is evidence of intrusion, commission of an
unlawful act, or emergency on the premises that would warrant a call for police

Operators requesting police response will notify the police dispatch which
Alarm Company Operator requested them to respond. Responders will meet police
at the premises (unless the Responder verified the Burglar Alarm by other than
on-site verification).
   O.    "Robbery Alarm or Panic Alarm". Any system, device, or mechanism,

criteria:
      1.   It is installed on real property;
      2.   It is designed to be manually activated by an individual for the
purpose of summoning assistance,
      3.   It transmits a telephonic, wireless, electronic, video or other form
of message (or emits an audible, visible, or electronic signal that can be
heard, seen, or received by persons outside the real property).

will substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms, or that a valid
reason for the false alarm(s) has been shown, and the aggrieved party is not
liable for the assessment as imposed by the Alarm Administrator, or

or to be taken will not substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms or
that a valid reason for the false alarm(s) has not been shown and the aggrieved
party is liable for the assessment as imposed by the Alarm Administrator.
      5.   Written notice shall be sent to the aggrieved party indicating the
decision of the Alarm Coordinator and shall set forth the findings and
conclusions with respect to the review of the report submitted.

11-04-150   Assessment of Costs.
   A.   In addition to the disposal procedures set forth in Article 2, Chapter
11, Title 28 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, following the removal of the
abandoned motor vehicle, the Town Manager, or his authorized representative,
may prepare a verified statement of account of the actual costs of such removal
and abatement (including storage), the date the work was completed, and the
street address and the legal description of the immediately adjacent real
property [including ten percent (10%) as provided in Section
11-04-070], and serve a duplicate copy of such verified statement upon the
owner or occupant of said adjacent real property in the manner prescribed in
Section
11-04-090. This procedure may only be used where the owner or occupant of the
adjacent real property is also the owner of the abandoned vehicle.
   B.   The owner or person controlling the adjacent real property shall have
thirty (30) calendar days from the date of service upon him to pay the
assessment as contained in the verified statement or appeal in writing to the
Town Council (through the Town Manager) from the amount of the assessment. If
an appeal is not so filed with the Town Council, then the amount of the
assessment as determined by the Town Manager shall become final and binding. If
an appeal is taken, the Town Council shall, at its next regular meeting, hear
and determine the appeal and may affirm the amount of the assessment, modify
the amount thereof, or determine that no assessment shall be made.
   C.   If the assessment is not paid and no appeal is taken from the amount of
the assessment, or if an appeal is taken and the Town Council affirms or
modifies the amount of the assessment [and said amount is not paid within five
(5) calendar days of the Council decision], the original assessment or the
assessment as so modified shall be recorded in the Office of the Yavapai County
Recorder, and from the date of its recording it shall become a lien on the lot
or tract of adjacent land until paid. Such liens shall be subject and inferior
to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and
encumbrances of record. No assessment shall be made and no lien shall be
recorded unless it was determined (either at the public hearing before the
Board of Adjustment or at a Council hearing on the assessment) that the owner
or occupant of the adjacent real property was responsible for the nuisance.
   D.   A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under the provisions
of this Section shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure and order of sale.
The Town shall have the right to bring action to enforce the lien in the
Superior Court of Yavapai County at any time after the recording of the
assessment, but failure to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its
validity. The recorded assessment shall be prime facie evidence of the truth of
all matters recited therein, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to
the recording thereof. Failure to record a lien against the real property does
not in any way prohibit the Town from utilizing any and all other remedies it
may have against the person adjudged responsible for the nuisance, and the Town
may pursue any remedies in law or equity to recover its costs, including
administrative costs, involved in abating the nuisance along with reasonable
attorney fees and investigative costs incurred.

In ARS § 48-3610 (as amended), the Arizona State Legislature enabled the Town
of Prescott Valley to assume the powers and duties for Floodplain Management
and adopt regulations in conformance with ARS § 48-3609 (as amended) designed
to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

Amended, 05/13/21)
12-01-020   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The Special Flood Hazard Areas (“SFHAs”) of the Town of Prescott Valley
are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for Flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare. expenditures for Flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   B.   These Flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in SFHAs which increase Flood heights and velocities and, when
inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately
Floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from Flood damage, also
contribute to the Flood loss.

12-01-030   Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to Flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly Flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
Flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in SFHAs;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of SFHAs so as to minimize blight areas caused by Flooding;
   G.   Participate in and maintain eligibility for Flood insurance and
disaster relief.

12-01-040   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and
provisions to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or Erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
Erosion or Flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to Floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against Flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural Floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other Development which may
increase Flood damage; and
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of Flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase Flood hazards in other
areas.

The degree of Flood protection required by this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger Floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Chapter does not
imply that land outside the SFHAs or uses permitted within such areas will be
free from Flooding or Flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the Town, any officer or employee thereof, the State of Arizona, or
FEMA for any Flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

12-05-050   Standards for Manufactured Homes.
All Manufactured Homes that are placed on site or receive Substantial
Improvement shall:
   A.   Be elevated to conform with Subsection
12-05-010(C) (1), (2) or (3) herein (as amended) (as applicable) so that the
bottom of the structural frame or the lowest point of any attached appliances
(whichever is lower) is at or above the RFE; and
   B.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include (but are not limited to) use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local

12-05-070   Floodways.
Located within SFHAs established in Section
12-03-020 herein (as amended) are areas designated as Floodways. Since the
Floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and Erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
   A.   Prohibit Encroachments (including, but not limited to, fill, New
Construction, Substantial Improvements and other Development) unless
certification by an engineer registered in the State of Arizona is provided
demonstrating that Encroachments shall not result in any increase in Flood
levels during the occurrence of the Base Flood discharge.
   B.   If the requirements of this Section are satisfied, all New Construction
and Substantial Improvements shall comply with all other applicable Flood
hazard reduction provisions in this Article 12- 05 (as amended).

12-06-020   Appeal Board.
12-06-030   Conditions for Variances.
12-06-010   Nature of Variances.
   A.   The Variance criteria set forth in this Article 12-06 (as amended) are
based on the general principle of zoning law that Variances pertain to a parcel
of property and are not personal in nature. A Variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this Chapter would create an exceptional Hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to Structures, inhabitants
or property owners.
   B.   It is the duty of the Town Council (serving as the Floodplain Board) to
avoid Program Deficiencies and thereby help protect the citizens of the Town
from Flooding. This need is so compelling (and the implications of the cost of
insuring a Structure built below the RFE are so serious) that Variances from
the Flood elevation or from other requirements in this Chapter are quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing Flood loss and damage can only be
met if Variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the Variance guidelines
provided in this
Article 12-06 (as amended) are more detailed and contain multiple provisions
that must be met before a Variance can be properly granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
Variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. No. 671, Enacted, 09/28/06; Ord. No. 889, Amended, 05/13/21)
12-06-020   Appeal Board.
   A.   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide Appeals and requests for
Variances from the requirements of this Chapter.
   B.   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide Appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
Chapter.
   C.   In considering such applications, the Floodplain Board shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
Articles and Sections of this Chapter, and:
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger to life and property due to Flooding or Erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
Flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the Town;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location (where
applicable);
      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to Flooding or Erosion damage;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
Development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
Floodplain Management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in time of Flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after Flood
conditions, including (but not limited to) maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities (e.g. sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems),
streets and bridges.
   D.   Upon consideration of the factors of this Subsection
12-06-020(C) (as amended) and the purposes of this Chapter, the Floodplain
Board may attach such conditions to the granting of any Variance as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.
   E.   Any applicant to whom a Variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a Town official that:
      1.   The issuance of a Variance to construct a Structure below the RFE
will result in increased premium rates for Flood insurance up to amounts as
high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage;
      2.   Construction below the RFE increases risks to life and property; and
   F.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all Variance
actions, including the justification for their issuance.

12-06-030   Conditions for Variances.
   A.   Variances shall only be issued:
      1.   Upon a determination that the granting of a Variance will not result
in increased Flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
      2.   Upon a determination that the Variance is the minimum necessary
(considering the Flood hazard) to afford relief;
      3.   Upon a showing of good and sufficient cause;
      4.   Upon a determination that failure to grant the Variance would result
in exceptional Hardship to the applicant;
      5.   Upon a showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes
only facilities described in the definition “Functionally Dependent Use” in
Article 12-02 (as amended).
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any Floodway if any increase in
Flood levels during the Base Flood discharge would result.
   C.   Variances may be issued:
      1.   For New Construction and Substantial Improvements to be erected on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing Structures constructed below the RFE, provided the procedures of
Articles 12-04 and
12-05 (as amended) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the Variance
increases;
      2.   For the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of Structures listed
in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the Structures continued designation as a Historic Structure and
the Variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the Structure.

12a-01-010   Findings of Fact.
Illicit discharges of stormwater occur to the municipal separate storm sewer
system (MS4) from residential, business, industrial or commercial facilities.
This often results in contaminated stormwater, wastes or wastewater entering
into receiving waters without treatment. This, in turn, may negatively impact
public health and welfare, and the environment. Because treatment is difficult
to provide, the regulatory focus is on avoiding such discharges in the first
place. And, because illicit discharges from facilities may be inadvertent, any
program of regulating such discharges by the Town of Prescott Valley to its MS4
must include a strong educational component along with regulation and
enforcement.
(Ord. No. 842, Enacted, 06/14/18)
12a-01-020   Purpose and Intent.
   A.   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for health, safety, and
general welfare within the Town through the regulation of non-stormwater
discharges to the MS4 to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) as required by
federal and state law. To that end, this Chapter requires that unless expressly
authorized or exempted no person shall cause, participate in, or allow
discharge to the MS4 of any substance not composed entirely of stormwater. This
Chapter establishes authority for designated Town personnel to conduct and
require inspection, monitoring, reporting, enforcement and education activities
to identify, prevent and remediate illicit discharges to the MS4.
   B.   It is the intent of this Chapter to comply with Arizona pollutant
discharge elimination system (AZPDES) regulations for stormwater discharges, to
be consistent with the stormwater quality provisions of the Clean Water Act (33
U.S.C. 1151 et seq.), and to otherwise enable the Town to comply with all
applicable stormwater quality provisions of federal, state, and local laws and
regulations to ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens
and protect and preserve the local environment.
   C.   Because the standards promulgated by this Chapter are minimum
standards, it is not intended or implied that compliance with the specific
provisions hereof will ensure that there is no actual contamination, pollution,
or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.

are adhered to.
   C.   It is the responsibility of persons discharging from any facility
connected directly or indirectly to the MS4 to demonstrate through testing,
records, plans, and other documents that the discharge is permitted under this
Chapter.
(Ord. No. 842, Enacted, 06/14/18)
12a-01-090   Plan Review, Inspections, Access and Reports.
   A.   Persons required to submit any grading, building, or other improvement
plans under the Town Code shall disclose any illicit discharge, stormwater, or
permitted non-storm water discharge of any type to the MS4 that may occur as a
result of, or in conjunction with, implementation of the plans. To the extent
the discharge would be an illicit discharge, the plan shall include BMPs to
remove or prevent the illicit discharge during and after construction (and said
BMPs shall be subject to approval of the Town Engineer).
   B.   Persons (including heirs and assigns) shall maintain any approved BMPs
during and after construction. Any changes to approved BMPs shall be at least
as effective in preventing pollution as the original BMPs and shall be timely
disclosed to the Town Engineer. The Town Engineer may require adjustments to
the proposed changes as necessary to assure that discharges to the MS4 are of a
quantity and quality that will not result in violations of the Town’s
stormwater permits.
   C.   Town representatives shall be granted reasonable access to all
facilities discharging to the MS4.
   D.   Further development of parcels and/or lots, regardless of time elapsed,
shall require use of current BMPs that are at least as effective as those
identified in the original plans in complying with applicable regulations,
laws, and codes. Any new State permits shall also be required.
   E.   Site-specific stormwater pollution prevention plans are required for
all construction projects one acre or greater in size. Such plans shall
identify minimum BMPs to be used upon further development of the project area.
      1.   Smaller areas may develop site-specific plans or provide a notice of
intent to abide by the Town’s general stormwater pollution guidelines. The
notice of intent shall be of a format approved by the Town Engineer and shall
at a minimum contain the following:
         a.   The name of the development (as applicable).
         b.   The name of the property owner.
         c.   The name of the person responsible for compliance with the
pollution prevention plan.
         d.   The anticipated time frame for constructing the project.
         e.   A statement to be signed by the responsible person and the
property owner stating:
            "The responsible person and the person owning the property for
which this Notice of Intent is submitted agree to require that all construction
work and related activity be conducted in accordance with the Prescott Valley
Town Code and the requirements of the Town of Prescott Valley General
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Guidelines. Such persons further understand
that failure to meet the mentioned requirements will be sufficient cause for
the Town to restrict or stop work on the property until the requirements are
met. Such persons may also be subject to other actions under law."
   F.   The Town Engineer shall develop, publish, and update from time to time
general stormwater pollution guidelines. These guidelines shall, at a minimum,
address pollution caused by soil erosion, motor oil, trash, and landscape

motor vehicle parking areas near land uses requiring substantial amounts of
vehicle parking, and to assure that parking in those areas is located and
screened to avoid incompatibility with uses in adjoining residential zoning
districts.
   H.   CN (commercial; neighborhood sales and services) zone. The purpose of
the CN zone is to provide for convenience shopping in a residential
neighborhood, to preserve and protect neighborhood commercial areas, located
near residential areas, and to provide for retail and service establishments
which supply commodities or perform services to meet the daily needs of the
neighborhood.
   I.   CG (commercial; general sales and services) zone. The purpose of the CG
zone is to accommodate retail and service establishments along major streets
and highways to serve a market area that extends beyond the immediate
residential neighborhoods.
   J.   CI (commercial; minor industrial) zone. The purpose of the CI zone is
to establish and preserve areas for commercial activities, including
warehousing, wholesaling, and light manufacturing, and related uses, that are
adequately buffered from residential areas and compatible with industrial uses,
and situated so that highway frontage does not present a poor image of the
community.
   K.   PM (performance manufacturing) zone. The purpose of the PM zone is to
provide locations for businesses, light manufacturing, warehouses, and research
and development industries operated in such a restricted and limited manner
that nearby residential land uses are protected and fostered by limitations on
the types of structures and uses, control on height and density, prohibitions
against open land facilities, omission of fumes, odors, noise, glare,
vibration, and similar nuisances, and landscaping requirements.
   L.   IG (industrial; general limited) zone. The IG zone is intended to
provide locations for manufacturing development, wholesale, and commercial uses
with heaviest impacts, which, while not necessarily attractive in operational
appearances, are installed and operated in compliance with all government
standards and in a way that does not cause inconvenience to other uses in the
zoning district or to adjacent zoning districts.
   M.   IH (industrial; heavy) zone. The purpose of the IH zone is to provide
locations for heavy industrial development and uses sited and operated in
compliance with all government standards and where any potential hazards to
health or property are appropriately mitigated and adequate controls are
provided to avoid air, surface water and groundwater pollution and latent
radiation, fire and explosion danger.
   N.   PL (public lands) zone. The purpose of the PL zone is to set aside
public or quasi-public lands for parks, public open space, governmental
buildings and facilities, schools and school grounds, quasi-public buildings
and facilities, towers, antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities,
and related uses.
   O.   AG (agricultural) zone. The purpose of the AG zone is to designate land
which is one or more of the following:
      1.   Ten or more acres of permanent crops
      2.   Grazing land with a minimum carrying capacity of 40 animal units
      3.   Land devoted to high density production of primary agricultural
product
      4.   Land devoted to processing cotton for marketing
      5.   Land devoted to processing wine grapes for marketing
   P.   PD (planned area development) zone. The PD zone is intended to
accommodate residential, business, or industrial development that takes a
creative approach that results in a more efficient, esthetic, and desirable use
of open space while maintaining the same overall population density and lot
coverage permitted in a comparable or underlying zoning district, and permits
flexibility in types of dwellings, placement of buildings, circulation
facilities, off-street parking areas, and use of open space as described in an
approved PD preliminary development plan adopted under section
13-14-060 (rezoning procedure).

13-06-040   PD (planned area development) zone
   A.    Description. The PD (planned area development) zone designation may be
applied to property with a planned area development adopted as overlay zoning
or as a primary zoning designation for a land area of five acres or larger.
      1.   If applied as an overlay zone, the regulations of the underlying
zoning designation are overlaid and supplemented by the regulations in the
adopted PD preliminary development plan.
      2.   If applied as a primary zoning designation, the regulations in the
adopted PD preliminary development plan define the permitted uses of the
property, and any land use not addressed in the adopted PD preliminary
development plan for the property is prohibited.
      3.   Each adopted PD preliminary development plan shall have a unique
name by which that PD is identified and regulated.
   B.    General. Properties in each PD are regulated based on site-specific
regulations in the adopted PD preliminary development plan, prepared by or on
behalf of the master property owner of the PD in accordance with this section.
Each PD preliminary development plan is adopted through the rezoning process
set forth in
Article 13-14, as supplemented by this section.
   C.    Purpose. The purpose of the PD (planned area development) zone is to:
      1.   Ensure orderly and thorough planning and review procedures that will
result in high quality urban design and to encourage variety in architectural
design through techniques including, but not limited to, variations in building
style, lot arrangements and site planning.
      2.   Establish procedures to provide flexibility in design, density and
development requirements for development plans while ensuring that such
flexibility does not adversely affect the intent and purpose of the general
plan.
      3.   Encourage through innovative site planning such things as the
preservation of natural character of the land, and economy in construction and
maintenance of streets and public utilities.
      4.   Allow flexibility in design so that developments would produce
maximum choice in the types of environments, living units, and commercial
installations and facilities available to the public, and produce an efficient,
esthetic, and desirable use of open space.
      5.   Produce an environment of stable character in harmony with the
surrounding areas and developments.
   D.   PD preliminary development plan contents. The applicant shall prepare a
proposed PD preliminary development plan containing written and graphic
information describing the general nature of the proposed development and
explaining its implementation of and compliance with the intent and objectives
of the general plan and this Chapter. At a minimum, the proposed PD preliminary
development plan shall include the following elements:
      1.   Narrative or overview, identifying the primary objectives of the
proposed PD preliminary development plan.
      2.   The proposed land use plan, using maps, graphics, and descriptions.
      3.   If the PD (planned area district) designation is an overlay, text
showing that the proposed uses are permitted in the underlying zoning district.
      4.   Implementation and administrative regulations.
      5.   The relationship of the property to the surrounding areas affected
by the proposed PD preliminary development plan.
      6.   Development and design regulations for buildings, landscaping,
parks, open space, and other elements of the proposed PD preliminary
development plan.
      7.   Description of the compatibility of the proposed PD preliminary
development plan with adjoining land uses.
      8.   Detailed regulations and programs for the systematic implementation
of the proposed PD preliminary development plan.
      9.   A map showing the street system, lot lines, and topography.
      10.   Specific development standards for the map elements.
      11.   Hydrology analysis of the proposed PD preliminary development plan
and its upstream and downstream context.
      12.   Standards for the phasing, construction and maintenance of major
and collector streets proposed for the plan area or needed for servicing the
proposed PD preliminary development plan.
      13.   Standards for the phasing, construction and maintenance of sewage
disposal, effluent use, storm water drainage, solid waste disposal, and public
utilities.
      14.   Standards for the conservation, development, or utilization of
natural resources, including surface water, soils, vegetation and wildlife.
      15.   For single-phase developments, a draft schedule for the
preservation of site features established by the proposed PD preliminary
development plan and the construction, dedication and provision of public
services.
      16.   For multi-phased plans, a draft phasing schedule for the
preservation of site features established by the proposed PD preliminary
development plan, the development of the various master blocks of the proposed
PD preliminary development plan, and the construction, dedication, and
provision of public services within and supporting the proposed PD preliminary
development plan.
      17.   The proposed pattern of residential or commercial land uses,
including areas to be conveyed, dedicated, or reserved for parks, parkways,
playgrounds, school sites, public buildings, and other similar public and semi-
public uses.
      18.   The existing underlying zoning district, an explanation of the
extent to which the proposed PD (planned area development) zoning designation
will be an overlay zone or a primary zoning designation, and a general
description of the resulting changes in permitted uses in the proposed PD
preliminary development plan.
      19.   A detailed explanation of how and to what extent the proposed PD
preliminary development plan is to supplement or supersede the adopted land
development code.
      20.   A conceptual site plan for each building site and common open
areas, showing the approximate location of all structures, buildings, and
improvements (except for single family detached units which shall be indicated
by lot location only), and indicating the proposed access ways, easements, and
other public property needed for, and open spaces around, buildings and
structures.
      21.   Preliminary plans and elevations of all building types, which need
not be the result of final architectural decisions and need only be in
sufficient detail for the Commission to recommend adoption of and for the
Council to accept for adoption the proposed PD preliminary development plan.

13-07-040   Additional yard and open space regulations
   A.    General. A yard or court shall be unobstructed from the ground up by
structures (other than fences, free standing walls, permitted accessory
structures, signs, and permitted deviations and projections).
      1.   Where reference is to a required yard or setback for a structure,
the minimum distance from the property line to the structure shall designate
the minimum yard.
      2.   No lot shall be reduced in a way that reduces any required yard or
open space below its minimum size.
      3.   No yard or open space required for a structure on one lot shall
serve the same purpose for a structure on another lot.
      4.   Through lots that front on two streets shall be considered (for
required setback purposes) as having two front yards.
      5.   Doors, windows, and other building features shall not protrude
beyond a lot boundary, including when open or in operation.
   B.   Required yard deviations (where not in conflict with future width
line).
      1.   Required front yard deviations
         a.   On lots rising in elevation from front to center and exceeding
26% grade, the required front yard may be reduced to not less than 50% of the
required minimum.
         b.   On lots zoned MH, a reduction in the required front yard from 25
feet to 20 feet shall be allowed if necessary to accommodate a longer
manufactured home, as long as the total length of the home does not exceed the
lot depth minus 44 feet. No manufactured home shall be installed with a reduced
front setback unless the reduction is necessary to accommodate the home in
conformance with this section.
      2.   Required side yard deviations.
         a.   On any interior residentially zoned lot lacking rear access, and
where the septic system is in the rear yard, one side yard must measure no less
than 11 feet from the eave or dripline of the house to provide access to the
rear yard. If this section applies, the opposite side yard may be reduced by no
more than three feet, when necessary.
         b.   On a corner lot backing to a key lot, no structure exceeding a
four-foot height may be located adjacent to the side street within a triangular
area formed by a line connecting the street intersection with the required
front setback line of the key lot. The requirements of section
13-07-120 (sight visibility triangle at street intersections) control when they
conflict with this paragraph.
         c.   The required side yard adjacent to an alley may be reduced by up
to 50%, provided that the reduced setback plus half the alley width is not less
than the required side yard width.
         d.   On legal nonconforming lots with sub-standard lot widths, a
required interior side yard may be reduced by half the lot width shortage as
long as the reduction does not exceed 25% of the required interior side yard
width.
      3.   Required rear yard deviations. On lots with a depth less than 280
feet, the width of half of an adjacent existing or planned public or private
alley or street right-of-way is counted toward determining whether the lot
meets the required rear yard requirement.
   C.   Encroachment into yards (where not in conflict with future width
lines). No structure (other than fences, free standing walls, or signs) shall
encroach upon or reduce any open space, required yard, minimum setback
requirement, minimum lot area requirement, or parking area as designated under
these provisions or under the provisions of the applicable zoning district,
except as follows:
      1.   All yard encroachments.
         a.   Cornices, eaves, coolers, open balconies, fire escapes,
stairways, or fire towers may project no more than five feet into any required
yard or court, but no closer than seven feet from any lot boundary.
         b.   Stills, leaders, belt courses (and similar ornamental features),
and chimneys may project two feet into any required yard or court.
      2.   Front yard encroachments.
         a.   A bay window, oriel, entrance, or vestibule not exceeding ten
feet in width may project three feet into any required front yard.
         b.   A balcony, carport, or attached open porch may project no more
than six feet into any front yard.
      3.   Rear yard encroachments
         a.   A bay window, oriel, entrance, or vestibule not exceeding ten
feet in width may project three feet into any required rear yard.
         b.   A balcony, carport, or attached open porch may project no more
than ten feet into any required rear yard, but no closer than ten feet from any
common lot boundary.
         c.   A detached accessory structure may be placed in a required rear
yard as long as it meets the minimum side yard setback of the lot.
   D.   Setbacks from streets and alleys (yard depth) are measured from the
more restrictive of the following:
      1.   From the boundary of a full width right-of-way (or what would be a
full width right-of-way where only a partial right-of-way exists), or
      2.   From a future right-of-way line (see subsection
13-07-130 D).
   E.   Measurements from street or alley centerline are from what would be the
centerline if a full right-of-way existed in accordance with the minimum right-
of-way widths as designated under subsection
13-07-130 C.
   F.   Courts that provide natural ventilation or light for rooms must be open
to the sky and maintain a minimum dimension of five feet plus one additional
foot width for each story above the first.

for collocating multiple providers and, as a condition of zoning, executes a
written agreement (collocation agreement) with the Town consenting to
application of the terms of this provision shall, unless waived by the
applicant, receive preferential treatment for either a final approval or
rejection of an application for a special use permit, or favorable terms for a
lease agreement with the Town. Any such preferential treatment or favorable
terms can only be given after the Town receives a complete and correct
application (either for a special use permit or a lease agreement), all fees,
and required forms and documents.
         b.   Collocation agreement: The collocation agreement shall provide
for at least the following:
            (1)   The applicant shall accept for collocation any FCC licensed
wireless telecommunications provider (additional user) who uses any compatible
technology, on commercially reasonable terms considering all of the factors a
reasonable leasing company would deem relevant in entering into a collocation
agreement.
            (2)   Any additional user seeking collocation shall submit
specifications for its equipment and use to the applicant and the applicant
shall respond to the additional user in writing within 30 days, furnishing all
technical requirements that must be resolved before collocation.
            (3)   The applicant and the additional user shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any outstanding technical or business terms. If technical or
business terms are not worked out 30 days or more after the applicant’s
response, the additional user may submit a written request to the applicant for
arbitration, and the applicant shall cooperate with the additional user to
arrange for the American Arbitration Association to designate a person
knowledgeable in collocation of wireless telecommunications providers to act as
arbitrator and to decide all issues between the parties. The arbitration shall
be held within 30 days after the request for arbitration. Upon the written
agreement of both parties, a different procedure for binding dispute resolution
may be used. The result of the arbitration or other resolution method agreed to
by the parties shall be binding and non-appealable.
            (4)   If the applicant has failed to comply with the decision of
the arbitrator within 15 days after the arbitrator’s decision, then either the
special use permit or the lease agreement with the Town related to the tower,
antenna, or wireless telecommunications facility shall be terminated and the
facility shall be removed within 30 days of the date of the arbitrator’s
certificate. If the applicant fails to remove the facility within the specified
time, the Town shall have all remedies available to it for elimination of a use
in violation of the Town Code.
            (5)   The additional user becomes a third-party beneficiary to the
collocation agreement upon submitting the request seeking collocation.
            (6)   The Town shall not be a party to any contract between the
applicant and the additional user, and shall not be made a party to any dispute
or arbitration between them. Applicant shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Town from and against any cost, including reasonable attorneys
fees, associated with any dispute or arbitration between the applicant and the
additional user.
            (7)   A lease or other agreement containing the business terms
proposed by the applicant for collocation shall be attached as an exhibit to
the collocation agreement.
      4.   Modification of structures. No existing tower, antenna or wireless
telecommunications facility may be changed or modified except as follows:
         a.   The change or modification is required by a change in user or
technology;
         b.   The change does not increase the height of the tallest component
above the height approved in this Chapter, in a special use permit, in a lease
agreement, or (in the case of an existing facility) above its current height
(except as allowed under 47 United States Code Section 1455);
         c.   At the conclusion of the change or modification, the structure
complies with all requirements of the building department; and
         d.   Each of the documents and certifications required for a special
use permit are provided.
      5.   Abandonment of facilities.
         a.   Any tower, antenna, or wireless telecommunications facility not
operated for a continuous period of 12 months due to some conduct within the
control of and attributable to the property owner shall be considered
abandoned, despite the owner or operator’s future intentions for the facility.
The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the real property
where the facility is located are jointly responsible for removing the
abandoned facility. If the facility is not removed within 60 days after the
owner and operator receive notice of abandonment from the Town, the Town may
remove the facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of
removal. The Town may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that
abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. The Town’s delay in acting
shall not waive the Town’s right to act. The Town may seek to have the
telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner’s or operator’s
intent to operate the facility and regardless of any permits, federal, state or
otherwise, which may have been granted.
         b.   If the owner of an abandoned telecommunications facility wishes
to use the abandoned facility, the owner must first apply for and receive all
applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this Chapter as if the
facility were new.
      6.   Removal of facilities.
         a.   All towers, antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities
shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state
or local building and technical codes, as well as the applicable health and
safety standards established by the FCC or other bodies having jurisdiction, to
ensure their structural integrity. If any telecommunications facility is
determined not to comply with the Code standards or to constitute a danger to
persons or property, the owner of the facility and the owner of the real
property shall have 30 days after notice from the Town to bring the facility
into compliance. If the telecommunications facility is not brought into
compliance within 30 days, the Town may provide notice to the owners requiring
the telecommunications facility to be removed. If the telecommunications
facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of the Town’s notice of
removal, the Town may remove the facility and place a lien upon the property
for the removal costs. The Town’s delay in acting shall not waive the Town’s
right to act. The Town may pursue all available legal remedies to ensure that
telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the Code standards or
which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or
removed. The Town may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed
regardless of the owner’s or operator’s intent to operate the facility and
regardless of any permits, federal, state, or otherwise, which may have been
granted.
         b.   Upon removal of the wireless telecommunication facility, the site
shall be returned to its natural state and topography, and vegetated consistent
with the natural surroundings.
      7.   Zoning compliance. For purposes of determining whether the
installation of a tower, antenna, or wireless telecommunications facility
complies with zoning district development regulations, including but not
limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and similar
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control even if the tower,
antenna, or wireless telecommunications facility is located on a separately
leased portion of the lot. Setback and separation distances shall be calculated
and applied irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries.
      8.    Setbacks. The following setback requirements apply to all towers,
antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities in zoning districts other
than PL for which a special use permit is required. Standard setback
requirements may be decreased because of a design safety certification under
subparagraph
13-07-090 B. 5 above, or as a condition imposed by the Board of Adjustment or
the Council if the goals of this Chapter would be better served by them:
         a.   Towers, antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities must
be set back from any lot line a distance equal to at least 100% of the height
of the structure unless the zoning district where the facility is located
requires a greater setback.
         b.   Guys and accessory structures must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
   C.   Real property owners in the PL (Public Lands) zone may require owners
of towers, antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities to enter into
lease agreements as pre-requisites to exercising the permitted use for towers,
antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities in the PL (Public Lands)
zone. Real property owners shall be guided by the current Wireless
Telecommunications Plan for Central Yavapai County, as adopted by the Town from
time to time in conjunction with other local jurisdictions, in determining
whether to enter into such lease agreements. The decision to enter into lease
agreements is at the sole discretion of the real property owners, bearing in
mind any prior contractual obligations and the option of tower, antennas, and
wireless telecommunications facilities owners to seek special use permits to
locate the facilities in other zoning districts if sites in the PL (Public
Lands) zone are unavailable. Prior to entering into lease agreements, real
property owners and potential lessees shall conduct at least one informational
meeting for owners of real property located within 300 feet of the proposed
facilities.
   D.   Towers, antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities that do
not qualify as accessory buildings, structures, or uses, but that otherwise
comply with the requirements of this Chapter, may be located on lots containing
other principal buildings, structures, or uses in accordance with the
requirements of this section.
   E.   For towers, antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities other
than those used solely for transmissions and receipt by a single use (such as
amateur radio and devices necessary for use of a subscription to a commercial
wireless provider service), zoning district height limitations for buildings:
      1.   Shall not apply in the PL (Public Lands) zone.
      2.   Shall apply in all other zoning districts.
      3.   Except as otherwise provided for as a condition of a special use
permit issued pursuant to this section.
   F.   For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower,
antenna, or wireless telecommunications facility complies with zoning district
development regulations, including (but not limited to) setback requirements:
      1.   Lot-coverage requirements, and similar requirements, the dimensions
of the entire lot shall control even though the tower, antenna or wireless
telecommunications facility may be located on a separately leased portion of
the lot.
      2.   Setback and separation distances shall be calculated and applied
irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries.
   G.   The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers, antennas,
and wireless telecommunications facilities in zoning districts other than PL
for which a special use permit is required, unless the applicant provides
certification that the structure has been specially designed to be safe from
collapse and except as otherwise provided for as a condition of a special use
permit issued pursuant to this section:
      1.   Towers, antennas, and wireless telecommunications facilities must be
set back from any lot line a distance equal to at least 100% of the height of
the structure unless a greater setback is required for the zoning district.
      2.   Guys and accessory structures must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
   H.   Applications for special use permit to construct towers, antennas, or
wireless telecommunications facilities shall be accompanied by the following
additional information:
      1.   The zoning classification of the site;
      2.   A map of all properties within 300 feet of the proposed site,
together with a mailing list of all property owners within 300 feet and stamped
envelopes pre-addressed to each such property owner;
      3.   A map of adjacent roadways;
      4.   A drawing of proposed means of access;

architect;
      7.   The setback distance between the proposed wireless
telecommunications facility and
         a.   the nearest residential unit,
         b.   all residentially zoned properties within 300 feet of the
wireless telecommunications facility,
         c.   all schools within 300 feet of the wireless telecommunications
facility, and
         d.   all hospitals within 300 feet of the wireless telecommunications
facility;
      8.   The separation distance from other towers described in the inventory
of existing sites, their type of construction, and the owners names and
addresses;
      9.   The method of fencing;
      10.   Coloration;
      11.   Materials;
      12.   Illumination;
      13.   Camouflage;
      14.   Certification that the wireless telecommunications facility, as
represented in the application, will comply with all FAA, FCC, and other
applicable regulations;
      15.   A map of all locations owned, leased or operated by the applicant
(and their coverages) within ten miles of the proposed site, or which are
capable of communication with the proposed site by wireless means;
      16.   A map of all designated multiple-site locations within two miles of
the proposed site;
      17.   An inventory of the location, height, and type of applicant’s
existing and proposed towers, wireless telecommunications facilities, and
alternative tower structures located in or within one mile of the Town;
      18.   Certification that all wireless telecommunications facilities
within 25 miles of the proposed site which are owned, leased, or operated by
any provider who will use the proposed site comply with all applicable FCC,
FAA, and other applicable regulations;
      19.   Certification of whether the applicant is applying for collocation

five miles of the proposed site have been notified of the application;
      21.   Copies of all federal and state wireless telecommunications
licenses for providers who will use the proposed facility;
      22.   A list of all existing PL zoning district sites located within five
miles of the proposed site, with an explanation why each site is not adequate
for reasonable commercial coverage; and
      23.   A list of each wireless telecommunications facility with which the
proposed site has the potential to interfere, including the name, address, and
phone number of each owner. Within ten days following filing of the
application, the applicant shall file a certificate that each of the listed
persons have been given written notice of the application.
   I.   When considering a special use permit application for towers, antennas
and wireless telecommunications facilities, the Commission and the Council
shall consider such factors as the height proposed for facilities, proximity to
other uses, proximity of historic sites, proximity of landmarks, vehicle
traffic routes, proximity of medical facilities, air routes, topographical
features, availability of public utilities, site access, and suitability of
alternative sites. With regard to alternative sites, the Commission and the
Council shall be guided by the most recently adopted Wireless
Telecommunications Plan for Central Yavapai County which sets forth the
priority of properties on which to place towers, antennas and wireless
telecommunications facilities. In addition, the following performance criteria
are deemed to be consistent with the health, safety and welfare of the
community with regard to siting of towers, antennas and wireless
telecommunications facilities:
      1.   Existing structures will be preferred over new structures;
      2.   New structures which appear to be structures commonly found within
the zoning district are preferred over apparent wireless telecommunications
facilities;
      3.   Wireless telecommunications facilities which cannot be readily
observed from adjacent streets are preferred;
      4.   Heights which do not exceed the height limitations for the
particular zoning district are preferred;
      5.   Collocation of multiple uses on a single wireless telecommunications
facility has significant favorable weight in evaluating an application;
      6.   Network development plans which achieve the fewest number of
wireless telecommunications facilities reasonably necessary for commercial
coverage have significant favorable weight in evaluating an application;
      7.   Location in the least restrictive zoning districts is preferred;
      8.   New facilities should not be sited within 300 feet of any residences
(including single- and multi-family residences and residential facilities such
as community residences and nursing homes), schools (but not including
secondary school and college athletic fields), or hospitals; and
      9.   Suitability of the location for collocation of governmental public
service wireless communication facilities has significant favorable weight in
evaluating an application.
   J.   When issuing a decision on a special use permit application for towers,
antennas and wireless telecommunications facilities, a written decision shall
be issued based on the evidence in the written record, and no decision shall
attempt to regulate radiofrequency emissions (except to require that applicants
meet FCC standards).

   A.    General. A comprehensive sign package is intended for coordinated
developments over 25 acres. For purposes of this section, a coordinated
development is a shopping center, PD (planned area development), or integrated
development project (IDP) comprising properties in a defined geographical area
developed under a common or joint ownership and thereafter having shared
parking or access and being managed and operated under mutual restrictive
covenants.
   B.    Application. The application packet for a comprehensive sign package
may be obtained from the Development Services Department, shall be evaluated
based upon the criteria in this section, and will be approved by a separate
resolution of the Council or in conjunction with approval of a preliminary
development plan as part of a rezoning approval process under section
13-14-060 (rezoning procedure).
   C.    Placement. All signs shall be placed where they are sufficiently
visible and readable for their function, considering factors including but not
limited to the following:
      1.   The purpose of the sign
      2.   The sign’s location relative to traffic movement and access points
      3.   Site features
      4.   Structures
      5.   Sign orientation relative to viewing distances and viewing angles
      6.   In commercial centers where tenants have little or no street
visibility, identification wall signs may be placed on the walls of the tenants
building.
   D.    Quantity. The number of signs that may be approved within any
development shall not be greater than that required to provide project
identification and entry signs, internal circulation and directional
information to destinations and development subareas, and business
identification. Factors to be considered shall include the size of the
development, the number of development subareas, and the integration of sign
functions.
   E.    Size. All signs shall be no larger than necessary for visibility and
readability. Factors to be considered in determining appropriate size shall
include topography, volume of traffic, speed of traffic, visibility range,
proximity to adjacent uses, amount of sign copy, placement of display (location
and height), lettering style, and the presence of distractive influences.
   F.   Specific justification must be made if a request is submitted for a
freestanding or wall sign to exceed any maximum standard prescribed under this
Article. Under no circumstances may an integrated development project exceed
any maximum height or area standard prescribed under this Article by more than
100%.
   G.   Evaluation criteria. In reviewing a comprehensive sign package, staff
shall consider the following:
      1.   The views of or from adjacent properties must not be impaired
      2.   The signs do not interfere with public utilities, government uses,
transportation, landscaping, or other relevant factors
      3.   The width of the street, the traffic volume, and the traffic speed
warrant the proposed signage
      4.   The signs do not pose a hazard to public safety.
   H.    Alterations. Minor alterations in sign locations resulting from
unexpected conditions on site may be approved by the Zoning Administrator.

except in the AG Agricultural zone, are:
      1.   To alleviate or prevent congestion of the public streets;
      2.   To promote the safety and welfare of the public by establishing
minimum requirements for the off-street parking of motor vehicles commensurate
with the property’s use;
      3.   To encourage parking areas with sufficient vehicle parking and
maneuvering areas; and

13-10-020   General regulations
   A.    General. No building permit shall be issued, and no use shall be
begun, until the applicant has provided evidence to the Town of sufficient
parking to meet the requirements of this Article.
   B.   Additions and change of occupancy. The applicant shall provide evidence
of required off-street parking:
      1.   When any main building is erected;
      2.   When an existing building is altered or enlarged; and
      3.   Where a use is intensified by a change of occupancy or by the
addition of floor area, seating capacity, or seats.
   C.   Maintenance of existing parking. Off-street parking required in
connection with any existing building or use shall be maintained while the
building or use remains.
      1.   Parking for the building or use may be reduced commensurate with any
amendment that reduces off-street parking requirements.
      2.   An existing building or use that is not altered, enlarged, or
intensified by a change of occupancy or the addition of floor area, seating
capacity, or seats is not required to comply with any amendment that increases
off-street parking requirements.
   D.   Combination of uses. If uses on a lot are combined, the total off-
street parking requirement shall be the sum of the off-street parking
requirements for the individual uses.
   E.   Collective parking. The joint use of off-street parking for two or more
adjoining buildings or uses is permitted if:
      1.   The total off-street parking equals or exceeds the off-street
parking requirements for the individual buildings or uses; and
      2.   The owners of all affected buildings and uses provide copies of
recorded cross-parking easements or other documentation evidencing the owners
reciprocal parking rights.
   F.   Recreational and commercial vehicles.
      1.   For the purposes of this subparagraph F, “recreational vehicles”

within the rear or interior side yard may temporarily park one recreational
vehicle in a front or exterior side yard for loading and unloading purposes
only for a period not to exceed 48 hours in any calendar month.

street right-of-way.
      5.   Recreational vehicles shall not be parked in a location or manner
that creates a traffic sight visibility problem for any neighbor or passing
motorist.
      6.   Except for loading or unloading for a reasonable time, the parking
of any commercial vehicle with a rated capacity of more than one ton on any lot
in a residential zoning district shall be considered a commercial use and is
prohibited.
      7.   Except as permitted by section 13-08-050 (mobile food vendors), the
parking in a residential zoning district of more than one vehicle customarily
in commercial use with a rated capacity less than one ton shall be deemed a
commercial use and is prohibited. This includes delivery vans, flat bed, and
stake bed trucks.
      8.   This subsection F does not apply to parking or storage within a
completely enclosed permanent structure.
      9.   The parking or storage in a residential zoning district of backhoes,
dump trucks, road graders, semi-truck tractors and trailers, flatbed or
enclosed trailers, self-propelled industrial equipment such as tanks, pumps,
machinery, and other large equipment not customarily in residential use is
prohibited except during construction.
      10.   Any person, firm or corporation found guilty of violating any
provision of this subsection F shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon
conviction, the offense shall be treated as a class 3 misdemeanor. Each day
such violation is permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and
shall be punishable as a separate offense.

13-10-070   Mixed use shared parking reductions
   A.   The Zoning Administrator and Town Engineer may approve a mixed-use
shared parking program upon finding that:
      1.   Mixed non-residential uses are proposed,
      2.   The mix of non-residential uses creates staggered peak periods of
parking demand, and
      3.   All other requirements set forth in this section are met.
   B.   A mixed-use shared parking program:
      1.   Allows the same spaces to be shared by multiple land uses, reducing
the total required parking.
      2.   May include parking on the same site or on one or more separate
parking parcels, subject to the provisions of this section.
   C.   An applicant for a shared parking program must demonstrate the
feasibility of shared parking pursuant to this section.
   D.   Shared parking spaces may be located on a different parking parcel than
the use it serves only under the following conditions:
      1.   The pedestrian access distance is no more than 300 feet from the
mixed-use shared parking lot to the use it serves, measured following a
reasonable and safe walking route from the main entrance of the use to the
nearest point of the parking lot.
      2.   A copy of the covenant required by paragraph J of this section is
submitted with the application for a building permit or certificate of
occupancy for the use to be served by the mixed-use shared parking program.
   E.   Parking spaces reserved for a specific individual or business purpose
(for example, reserved for doctors only) or designated and marked for use by
handicapped persons shall not be counted toward meeting shared parking
requirements.
   F.   The maximum reduction in the number of parking spaces required for all
uses in a mixed-use shared parking program shall be 20%.
   G.   The Zoning Administrator and Town Engineer may determine the shared
parking requirements of a mixed-use shared parking program by:
      1.   Using the mixed-use shared parking calculation method set forth in
paragraph H of this section, or
      2.   Finding that the land uses in question will use the shared spaces at
different times of the day, week, month, or year using a more detailed study
that:
         a.   Is based on the Urban Land Institute’s shared parking study
methodology or other generally accepted methodology;
         b.   Addresses the size and type of activities, the composition of
tenants, the rate of turnover for proposed shared spaces, and the anticipated
peak parking and traffic loads;
         c.   Provides for a reduction by not more than 20% of the combined
parking required for each non-commercial land use; and
         d.   Provides for no reduction in the number of spaces reserved for
persons with disabilities or used for a specific individual or business
purpose.
   H.   The minimum number of parking spaces required for a mixed-use shared
parking program may be determined by multiplying the minimum parking
requirements for each individual use by the percentage set forth in the table
below for each of the five designated time periods and adding the resulting
sums from each vertical column. The column with the highest sum is the minimum
shared parking space requirement for the mixed-use shared parking program for
that combination of land uses.

consecutive meetings or commits misconduct, the Board may place an item on the
next available agenda to recommend that the Council remove the member and

   H.    Quorum. Three members of the Board of Adjustment shall constitute a

   I.    Submission. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by persons
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the Town affected
by a decision of the Zoning Administrator, within a reasonable time, by filing
with the Zoning Administrator and with the board a notice of appeal specifying

   K.   Stay of proceedings. An appeal to the Board of Adjustment stays all
proceedings in the matter appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator

property. On the certification proceedings shall not be stayed, except by
restraining order granted by the board or by a court of record on application
and notice to the Zoning Administrator. Proceedings shall not be stayed if the
appeal requests relief that has previously been denied by the board except

the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Chapter
      2.   Reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order or decision
appealed from and make such order or decision as ought to be made (and, to that
end, shall have the powers of the Zoning Administrator)
      3.   Interpret this Chapter when the meaning of any word, phrase or
section is in doubt, or where doubt exists as to whether a non-listed use is
similar enough to listed uses as to clearly have been intended to be included
in a zone, either as a permitted use or a conditional use.
      4.   Hear and decide appeals for variances from the terms of this Chapter
only if, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including
its size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application
of this Chapter will deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by other
property of the same classification in the same zoning district. Any variance
granted is subject to conditions as will assure that the adjustment authorized
shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the
limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the
property is located.
      5.   Determine the location of a zone boundary where doubt exists as to
its location on the zoning map.
      6.   Modify the Zoning Administrator’s requirements in instances where a
use is conditional upon certain stipulations specified by the Zoning
Administrator.

under Town Code
Article 9-04a (Junked Motor Vehicles) and from notices of intent to abate
nuisances and remove vehicles under Town Code
Article 11-04 (Abandoned Vehicles).
   N.   The Board of Adjustment may not:
      1.   Make any changes in the uses permitted in any zoning classification
or zoning district, or make any changes in the terms of this Chapter, provided
the restriction in this subparagraph shall not affect the authority to grant
variances pursuant to this section.
      2.   Grant a variance if the special circumstances applicable to the
property are self-imposed by the property owner.
   O.    Voting. The affirmative vote of three members shall be required for
passage of any matter before the Board of Adjustment.
      1.   The minutes of Board of Adjustment meetings shall reflect the “ayes”
and “nays” cast on a particular measure and shall reflect the vote of each
member present.
      2.   A member may abstain from voting only upon the member’s declaration
of a conflict of interest, in which case the member shall take no part in the
deliberations on the matter in question.
      3.   The Board shall issue a decision within 30 days after all parties
have completed their submission of evidence and arguments.
      4.   If one or more Board members are absent at the time set for the
Board of Adjustment to hear the appeal and the applicant requests a continuance
before testimony is begun or evidence is introduced, the appeal shall be
continued to a date when the full Board membership is in attendance.
   P.   A variance for a specific development scheme shall expire if permits
are not obtained and work is not begun within six months after the variance is
granted or if construction is not diligently pursued, unless a period longer
than six months is granted or an extension of time is secured from the Zoning
Administrator or, on appeal, from the Board of Adjustment.

13-13-090   Conditional use permits
   A.   A conditional use permit is required for specified uses that are not
permitted outright in a particular zoning district but that may be appropriate
for a particular location or with restrictions that mitigate actual or
potential impacts of the use.
   B.   Conditional use permit applications must be accompanied by:
      1.   A layout;
      2.   A landscape plan stamped by a registered landscape architect (not
required for a manufactured home on its own individual lot);
      3.   Building elevations and other pertinent development characteristics;
      4.   An estimate of the total cost of the project, and evidence of the
applicant’s ability to complete the project; and
      5.   Civil, mechanical, structural, or electrical engineering
information, certified by an Arizona licensed professional engineer, as needed
to support the application.
   C.   A conditional use permit application shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator for consideration.
      1.   Upon receiving a conditional use permit application signed by the
property owner, the Zoning Administrator shall send notice by first class mail
to each real property owner, as shown on the last assessment of the property,
within 300 feet of the property for which the conditional use permit is sought,
describing the requested use and stating that objections to the requested use
must be submitted in writing to the Zoning Administrator within ten business
days after the date of the notice.
      2.   After the ten-day period for objections, and no later than 20
business days after sending notice to surrounding property owners, the Zoning
Administrator shall render a decision to issue or deny the conditional use
permit, making findings based on upon the requirements of this section. The
Zoning Administrator may issue the conditional permit with or without imposing
conditions on the use to mitigate actual or potential impacts of the use.

(05/26/1988) and 439 (06/25/1998))
13-13-100   Special use permits
   A.   A special use permit is required for specified uses that are not
permitted outright in a particular zoning district but that may be appropriate
for a particular location or with restrictions that mitigate actual or
potential impacts of the use through a more rigorous process than the
conditional use permit process.
   B.   Special use permits are issued by the Council after a recommendation
from the Commission.
   C.   Special use permit applications must be submitted to the Development
Services Department and accompanied by the same information as required for a
conditional use permit (see subsection
13-13-090 B).
   D.   Upon receiving a special use permit application signed by the property
owner, after determining that the application is complete, and not less than 15
days prior to the Commission hearing, the Development Services Department shall

last assessment of the property, within 500 feet of the property for which the
special use permit is sought, explaining the substance of the proposed
application and setting forth the time, date, and location of the Commission
and Council hearings on the application.
   E.   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on the special use permit
application, and shall make a recommendation to the Council to approve or deny
the application.
   F.   The Council shall hold a public hearing on the special use permit
application, and shall approve or deny the application.
(Added by Ordinance No 2024-947, 12/11/2024.)
13-13-110   Provisions common to conditional use permits and special use
permits
   A.   The requirements of this section apply to all conditional use permits
and special use permits except when the requirements of this section directly
contradict the provisions of the final approved conditional use permit or
special use permit.
   B.   The granting of a conditional use permit or special use permit is a
matter of discretion, not of right (conditional or otherwise). The burden of
proof lies with the applicant to satisfactorily show that any structure that is
involved will not be detrimental to persons residing or working in the
vicinity, to adjacent property, to the neighborhood, or to the public welfare
in general, and that the same will be in full conformity with any conditions,
requirements or standards prescribed by or under this Chapter.
   C.   In approving an application (in all or in part), the Zoning
Administrator and the Council may impose conditions of approval that will
mitigate any adverse impacts or effects of the proposed use and advance the
objectives of this Chapter, and may require guarantees to ensure compliance
with the conditions of approval.
   D.   Failure to comply with conditions of approval shall be treated as a
zoning violation.
   E.   The granting of any conditional use permit or special use permit shall
be contingent upon building permits being obtained within six months and work
being diligently pursued to completion. Failure to meet this condition shall
void the conditional use permit or special use permit unless an extension of
time is secured from the Zoning Administrator (for a conditional use permit) or
the Council (for a special use permit).
   F.   A conditional use permit or special use permit granted without an
operational time limit authorizes the permitted use to operate permanently in
accordance with the requirements of this Chapter and the requirements imposed
as a condition of approval of the conditional use permit or special use permit.
   G.   Any use allowed by conditional use permit or special use permit may
also be allowed when it is expressly authorized as a condition of rezoning and
included in the approved preliminary development plan. The use shall comply
with any mitigation measures or other requirements and conditions imposed on
the use as part of the rezoning approval.
(Added by Ordinance No 2024-947, 12/11/2024.)
13-13-120   Conditional uses upon annexation or diminution claim
   A.   Purpose annexation. The uses and densities permitted under county
zoning and in county zoning districts do not directly correlate to the uses and
densities permitted in the most closely comparable Town of Prescott Valley
zoning districts. Upon annexation, this section is intended to authorize the
Council to conditionally permit uses and densities permitted by the county
immediately before annexation upon translation of county zoning to the most
closely comparable Town of Prescott Valley zoning classification.
   B.   Purpose diminution claim. Town of Prescott Valley code text and zoning
amendments sometimes result in the filing of a claim for diminution of property
value under A.R.S. § 12-1134. Upon receiving a diminution claim, this section
is intended to authorize the Council to conditionally permit uses and densities
permitted prior to the amendment that resulted in the diminution claim.
   C.    Applicability. The special procedures and authority set forth in this
section apply only to the translation of county zoning to Town of Prescott
Valley zoning upon annexation of property or to the reinstatement of uses and
densities in response to a diminution claim.
   D.    Procedure. Conditional uses approved pursuant to this section shall be
included in an ordinance adopted by Council translating county zoning upon
annexation or in a Council action in response to a diminution claim.
   E.    Findings. In determining whether to approve one or more conditional
uses pursuant to this section, the Council shall consider whether the proposed
use or uses:
      1.   Will adversely affect the orderly development and improvement of
surrounding property for uses permitted within the zoning district;
      2.   Will be injurious to the use and enjoyment of property in the
immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, or substantially
diminish or impair the property values within the neighborhood;
      3.   Will adversely affect town revenues;
      4.   Conform to the character of the neighborhood, within the same zoning
district, in which it is located, considering the location, type, and height of
the buildings or structures and the type and extent of landscaping and
screening on the site;
      5.   Is on a proposed site adequate in size and shape to accommodate the
intended use;
      6.   Will have ingress and egress designed to minimize traffic hazards
and to minimize traffic congestion on the public roads;
      7.   Is consistent with the general plan and other adopted town plans;
      8.   Is noxious or offensive by reason of vibration, noise, odor, dust,
smoke, or gas; and
      9.   Will have adequate public utilities, access roads, drainage, fire
protection, and other necessary facilities.
   F.    Conditions. Conditional uses approved by the Council pursuant to this
section may include conditions the Council deems necessary to mitigate
potential impacts and ensure compatibility of the use with surrounding
development and the town as a whole, including without limitation those
considerations set forth in paragraph E of this section.
   G.   Modification of conditional use. A request to modify, expand, or
otherwise change a conditional use approved by the Council pursuant to this
section shall be processed according to the provisions for the initial
consideration of conditional uses under this section.
   H.    Revocation. Failure to comply with the conditions, stipulations, or
terms of the approval of a conditional use is a zoning violation.
   I.   Status of the conditional use. A conditional use approved pursuant to
this section shall run with the land and continue to be valid regardless of
ownership of the property or structure so long as it operates within the
conditions, stipulations, and terms of the approval.

The preparation, submittal, review and approval of all Subdivision Plats
located inside the limits of the Town shall proceed through the following
stages:
   A.   Pre-application stage.
   B.   Preliminary Plat stage.
   C.   Final Plat stage.
(Ord. No. 25, Enacted, 03/27/80; Ord. No. 178, Renumbered, 05/26/88, 17-02-010;
Ord. No. 801, Amended, 02/12/15)
14-02-020   Pre-Application Stage.
   A.   Purposes: This stage affords the Subdivider the opportunity of
obtaining the advice and assistance of, and informally discussing the proposed
Subdivision with the Department prior to the expense of a Preliminary Plat
preparation. It also affords the Department the opportunity to give informal
guidance at a time when potential points of conflict can be most easily
resolved, subsequent relations improved, official action simplified, and undue
expense and delay saved by the Subdivider.
   B.   Actions by the Subdivider: The Subdivider shall meet informally with
the Department to present a general outline of his proposal including, but not
limited to:
      1.   Concepts and ideas regarding land use, street, and lot arrangements
and tentative lot sizes.
      2.   Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal, surface
drainage, and street improvements.
   C.   Actions by the Department: The Department shall discuss the proposal
with the Subdivider and advise him of procedural steps, design and improvement
standards, and general plat requirements. Then, depending upon the scope of the
proposed development, the Department shall proceed with the following
investigations:
      1.   Advise the Subdivider if a zoning change will be required and that
such change must be obtained prior to additional processing of the application.
      2.   Advise the Subdivider if a General Plan amendment will be required
and that such amendment must be obtained prior to additional processing of the
application.
      3.   Determine the adequacy of existing or proposed schools, parks, and
other public spaces.
      4.   Inspect the site or otherwise determine its relationship to
Arterials, utility systems, and adjacent land uses, and determine if there are
any unusual problems related to topography, utilities, flooding, etc.
      5.   Provide the applicant with all of the necessary Town application
forms; review with the applicant the submittal requirements and the
neighborhood meeting requirements; and discuss the applicable schedules for the
project.
      6.   Determine the need for preparation and review of an MDP prior to
subsequent consideration of a Preliminary Plat. Advise the Subdivider if an MDP
is required and to what extent it shall be prepared by the Subdivider and by
the Department.
   D.   Master Development Plan (MDP): The Department shall use the following
guidelines in establishing the need for an MDP: whether the tract is
sufficiently large to comprise an entire neighborhood; whether the tract
initially proposed for platting is only a portion of a larger landholding of
the Subdivider; or whether the tract is a part of a larger land area (the
development of which is complicated by unusual topographic, utility, land use,
land ownership or other conditions). The entire land area considered in
determining the need for an MDP need not be under the Subdivider's control but
may be part of a multi-faceted plan encompassing multiple developers and uses.
MDPs shall be mandatory for developments of one hundred (100) or more acres
consisting of a mixture of residential zoning districts and optional
neighborhood commercial districts that support the needs of the neighborhood.
      1.   Preparation: The MDP shall be prepared to scale, accurate to a level
commensurate with its purpose, and shall include:
         a.   General street patterns with particular attention to Collectors
and future circulation throughout the neighborhood.
         b.   General location and size of school sites, parks, or other public
areas.
         c.   Location of shopping centers, multi-family residential areas, or
other proposed land uses.
         d.   Methods proposed for sewage disposal, water supply, and storm
drainage.
         e.   Location of buildings and circulation for condominium
developments.
         f.   A statement by the Department that the development conforms to
the (i) Parks, Trails and Open Space Master Plan, (ii) Town’s most current
adopted transportation plans, and (iii) General Plan.
      2.   Approval: Upon acceptance of the general design approach by the
Department, the MDP may be submitted to the Commission and Council for their
consideration. If development is to take place in several parts, the MDP should
be submitted as supporting data for each part. The MDP should be kept up-to-
date by the Subdivider and the Department as modifications take place.
(Ord. No. 25, Enacted, 03/27/80; Ord. No. 178, Ren&Amd, 05/26/88, 17-02-020;
Ord. No. 375, Amended, 12/28/95; Ord. No. 801, Amended, 02/12/15)
14-02-030   Preliminary Plat Stage.
The Preliminary Plat stage of land subdivision includes submittal, review, and
approval of the Preliminary Plat. The Subdivider shall provide the Department
with all information essential to determine the character and general
acceptability of the proposed development.
   A.   Zoning: The Subdivision shall be designed to meet the specific
requirements for the zoning district within which it is located. However, in
the event that a zoning amendment or a zoning adjustment is necessary for
conformance with district regulations, said action shall be initiated by the
property owner or his authorized agent. The Department shall not proceed with
processing of the Preliminary Plat until the necessary amendment or adjustment
has been obtained. Any furtherance of pre-development activity engaged in, by,
or on behalf of the Subdivider while an application for zoning amendment or
variance is pending shall in no instance be construed as having been undertaken
in reliance on a favorable determination of such application (notwithstanding
the nature of a Department recommendation on the matter). In any event, any
such zoning amendment or adjustment required in relation to the Preliminary
Plat shall have been adopted prior to Preliminary Plat approval.
   B.   State and County Sanitary Sewerage and Water Supply Requirements: Where
location of the development requires that the State and/or County be involved
in sewage disposal, water supply, or fire protection, the Subdivider shall have
first informed the appropriate State and/or County department of his tentative
plans and learned the general requirements prior to Preliminary Plat review by
the Department.
   C.   Preliminary Plat Submission:
      1.   Three (3) copies of the Preliminary Plat and other required
supporting data prepared in accordance with requirements set forth in this
Section shall be filed with the Department. Submission shall include fees as
required by Section
14-01-030 of this Chapter (as amended). Copies of the Preliminary Plat shall be
reproduced in the form of blue line or black line prints on a white background.
The Preliminary Plat and all required supporting data shall also be provided in
approved digital image format. Scheduling of the case for Commission hearing
shall be dependent upon adequacy of data presented and completion of
processing.
      2.   The submittal shall be checked by the Department for completeness.
If it is incomplete as to those requirements set forth in this Section, the
submittal shall be rejected and the Subdivider notified within five (5) days
from the date the map was received.
   D.   Preliminary Plat Review:
      1.   On receipt of the Preliminary Plat, the Department shall perform its
review for compliance with public objectives. In so doing the Department shall
give special attention to design principles and standards as set forth in
Article 14-03 of this Chapter (as amended); to streets and thoroughfares (as
related to the Town transportation plans) and to neighborhood circulation; to
utility methods and systems; to existing and proposed zoning and land use of
the tract and its environs; to land required for schools, parks, and other
public facilities; to the mailbox plan as approved by the US Post Office; and
to any traffic impact analysis required by the Town Engineer.
      2.   The Department shall distribute copies of the Plat to the
appropriate agencies for review.
      3.   The Department shall collect the written comments of the reviewing
offices, determine whether the proposed Preliminary Plat substantially conforms
to the submission requirements, prepare a report, and present it to the
Commission.
   E.   Preliminary Plat Approval:
      1.   If the Department report indicates that the requirements of this
Chapter have been met, the Commission shall consider the Preliminary Plat at a
future regular meeting.
      2.   The Commission shall consider the Preliminary Plat and the
Department's recommendations and, if satisfied that all objectives have been
met, the Commission shall approve the Preliminary Plat.
      3.   If the Plat is generally acceptable but requires minor revision
before proceeding with preparation of the Final Plat, the Commission shall find
Conditional Approval. At the direction of the Commission, the Plat may be given
approval subject to the revisions in accordance with the stated conditions and
reviewed by the Department.
      4.   If the Commission finds that the Plat requires major revision, the
Plat may be continued pending revision or re-submittal for the same tract or
any part thereof, and shall follow the aforementioned procedure.
   F.   Significance of Preliminary Approval: Preliminary approval constitutes
authorization for the Subdivider to proceed with preparation of the Final Plat
and the engineering plans and specifications for improvements. Preliminary
approval is based upon the following items:
      1.   All subsequent Final Plats submitted within the Preliminary Plat
shall comply with the basic conditions under which the Preliminary Plat is
granted by the Commission.
      2.   Preliminary Plat approvals shall expire after twenty-four (24)
months from the date of Commission approval unless a Final Plat which complies
with the provisions of this Article is submitted for approval prior to the
expiration of said period. Notwithstanding this requirement, a different period
of validity may be negotiated as part of a development agreement between the
Subdivider and the Town pursuant to ARS § 9-500.05 (as amended).
      3.   Preliminary Plat approval, in itself, does not assure final
acceptance of streets for dedication or continuation of existing zoning
requirements for the tract or its environs, nor constitute authorization to
record the Plat.

   A.   Non-Subdivision Residential Developments (as defined in this Section)
that are otherwise exempt from the requirement in ARS §§ 9-463.01(I) and 45-576
(A), and Town Code §
14-02-060(F)(6) of being accompanied by a Certificate of Assured Water Supply
(CAWS) issued by the Director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources
(ADWR) in order to receive Town approvals, shall nonetheless comply with the
requirements of Subsection (B) herein prior to any Town approvals (said
approvals to include, but not necessarily be limited to, issuance of any
required General Plan Amendment, Zoning Map Amendment, Final Development Plan,
and/or Building Permit).
   B.   Non-Subdivision Residential Developments (as defined in this Section)
shall obtain and pledge to the Town (using forms approved by the Town Attorney)
sufficient rights to use renewable or imported water supplies in amounts
sufficient to obtain a CAWS from ADWR (or a written commitment of water service
from a city, town, or private water company with a Designation of Assured Water
Supply (DAWS) from ADWR) if the Non-Subdivision Residential Development had
otherwise been required to obtain a CAWS or written commitment from an entity
with a DAWS under Arizona law and/or regulation. Said amounts shall be
determined by reference to the same statutory and regulatory requirements and
forms as ADWR would have used for determination of water rights required for a
CAWS or written commitment from an entity with a DAWS.
      1.   The determination of the amount of renewable or imported water
supplies to be included in the right pledged to the Town shall be made by the
Town Manager (or designee) as set forth above. Documentation of the forms and
calculations supporting said determination shall be timely provided in full to
any duly authorized Non-Subdivision Residential Development representative or
agent upon request.
      2.   In the event any duly authorized Non-Subdivision Residential
Development representative or agent disputes in writing the amount of renewable
or imported water supplies required pursuant to this Section within ten (10)
working days after receipt in writing of the Town Manager’s (or designee’s)
final determination, an appeal may be made to an independent Hearing Officer
designated by the Town in accordance with the same procedures set forth in
Article
7-01-110 of the Town Code for formal appeals from orders, requirements, or
decisions of the Town Building Official. An appellant shall file an application
for review on forms provided by the Town Engineer. Appellants shall have the
right to bring a Special Action in the Yavapai County Superior Court from the
final ruling of the independent Hearing Officer.

successor) under the November 19, 2007 Effluent Water Auction Agreement (or any
extension thereof) (Agreement) between the Town and WPI, LLC (or its successor)
as a renewable water supply for purposes of complying with this Subsection (B),
the transaction by which the Effluent Interests are obtained shall comply in
all material respects with the requirements for alternative uses of said
Effluent Interests as set forth in said Agreement. It is expressly understood
that such Effluent Interests do not refer to (and shall not be deemed to
include) any first-generation effluent for purposes of complying with this
Subsection (B).
      4.   As part of its annual reporting to ADWR under the Arizona
Groundwater Management Act, designated Town staff shall notify ADWR in writing
of the rights to renewable or imported water supplies pledged to the Town
pursuant to this Section.
   C.   As used in this Section, “Non-Subdivision Residential Developments” are
those residential uses listed as exceptions to the definition of “subdivision”
in ARS §32-2101(58) (as amended), including leasehold offerings of one year or
less, apartments, pads or similar spaces within apartment buildings, rental
recreational vehicle communities, rental manufactured home communities, or
rental mobile home parks. Improved or unimproved land divided for the purpose
of financing, sale, or lease (whether immediate or future) that is not a
subdivision under Town Code §
14-01-010(A)(39) simply because it has fewer than four (4) lots, tracts, or
parcels (or, if a new street is involved, any single lot, tract, or parcel) is
not considered a “Non-Subdivision Residential Development” for purposes of this
Section.

   A.   Conformance to Plans. Every Subdivision shall conform to requirements
and objectives of the General Plan (or any parts thereof) as adopted by the
Council; to the Town Zoning Chapter; to this Chapter; to other ordinances,
codes, and regulations of the Town; and to the Arizona Revised Statutes (as
amended).
   B.   Dedication of Parks and other Public Lands. Where the tract contains
all or any part of the site of a school, park, or other public site (as shown
on the General Plan or as recommended by the Commission), such site shall
either be dedicated to the public or reserved for acquisition by the public
within a specified period of time. An agreement shall be reached between the
Subdivider and the appropriate public agency regarding time, method, and cost
of such acquisition. In the event of failure to reach such agreement within a
reasonable period of time for reasons satisfactory to the Commission, the
Commission may determine that requirements of this Section have been met.
   C.    Land Unsuitability. No land shall be subdivided which is determined by
the Commission to be unsuitable for residential use by reason of flooding,
concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formations,
extreme topography, erosion susceptibility, or similar conditions which are
likely to prove harmful to the health, safety and general welfare of the
community or the future property owners. The Commission, in applying the
provisions of this Section, shall state in writing the particular facts upon
which its conclusions are based and shall also define the conditions under
which the land may, in its opinion, become suitable for the proposed
development. Any Subdivider proposing development of such land shall have the
right to present evidence to the Council contesting such determination of
unsuitability, whereupon the Council may affirm, modify, or withdraw the
restriction.

14-03-020   Street Location and Arrangement.
   A.   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a street
designated in an adopted Town transportation plan, such street shall be platted
in conformance therewith.
   B.   Street layout shall provide for the continuation of such streets as the
Department may designate.
   C.   Whenever a tract to be subdivided is located within an area for which
an NP has been approved by the Commission, the street arrangement shall conform
substantially to said Plan.
   D.   Certain proposed streets, as designated by the Department, shall be
extended to the tract boundary to provide future connection with adjoining
unplatted lands.
   E.   Local Streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by
through-traffic.
   F.   Street locations and access shall conform to the provisions of Chapter
6 "Circulation Element" of the General Plan (as amended).
   G.   Where a Subdivision abuts or contains the Right-of-Way of a railroad,
drainage way, a limited access highway, or an irrigation canal, or abuts a
commercial or industrial land use, the Department may require the location of a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such Right-of-Way at a
distance suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distance
shall be determined with due regard for approach grades, drainage, bridges, or
future grade separations.
   H.   Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography as to
produce desirable lots of maximum utility and streets of reasonable gradient,
and to facilitate adequate drainage.
   I.   Half streets shall be discouraged except where necessary to provide
Right-of-Way required by the Town transportation plans, to complete a street
pattern already begun, or to ensure reasonable development of a number of
adjoining parcels. Where there exists a platted half street abutting the tract
to be subdivided, the remaining half shall usually be platted within the tract.
   J.   Where private access ways are approved, statements shall be contained
on the Plat (and in both the deed restrictions and the homeowners association
by-laws) that those access ways are subject to an easement authorizing use by
emergency and public service vehicles, but otherwise remain the permanent
responsibility of the homeowners association.

access).
      4.   Alleys - sixteen (16) feet wide where single-family residential uses
are on both sides, and twenty (20) feet wide if there are abutting commercial,
multiple-family residential, or industrial uses. Alley intersections and sharp
changes in alignment shall be avoided but, where necessary, corners shall be
cut off fifteen (15) feet on each side to permit safe vehicular movement. Dead-
end alleys are prohibited. All half alleys shall have a minimum width of twelve
(12) feet.
      5.   Private Access Ways - as required by applicable Town standards.
   C.   Grades:
      1.   Maximum:

14-03-040   Block Design.
   A.   Maximum length of blocks, measured along the centerline of the street
and between intersecting street centerlines, shall be no more than fifteen
hundred (1,500) feet. However, in developments with lot areas averaging one-
half (1/2) acre or more (or where extreme topographic conditions warrant), this
maximum may be exceeded by five hundred (500) feet. Blocks shall be as long as
reasonably possible under the circumstances within the above maximum in order
to achieve depth and possible street economy, and to reduce the expense and
safety hazard arising from excessive street intersections.
   B.   Maximum Length of Cul-de-Sacs shall be no more than thirteen hundred
twenty five (1,325) feet, measured from the intersection of Right-of-Way lines
to the extreme depth of the turning circle along the street centerline.
Exceptions may be made where topography justifies but shall not be made merely
because the tract has restrictive boundary dimensions. Rather, provisions shall
be made for extension of the street pattern to the adjoining unplatted parcel
(and a temporary turnaround installed).

   A.   Lot width, depth, and area shall comply with the minimum requirements
of the Zoning Code and shall be appropriate for the location and character of
development proposed (and for the type and extent of street and utility
improvements being installed). Where steep topography, unusual soil conditions,
or drainage problems exist or prevail, the Commission may require special lot
width, depth, and area requirements which exceed the minimum requirements of
the particular zoning district.
   B.   Where steep topography, unusual soil conditions, drainage problems,
abrupt changes in land use, or heavy traffic on adjacent streets prevail, the
Commission may make special lot width, depth, and area requirements which
exceed the minimum requirements of the particular zoning district.
   C.   Single-family residential lots shall not have a width to depth ratio
greater than one (1) to three (3).

14-03-090   Hillside Development.
Because of the unique and peculiar problems inherent in the development of
hillside areas, special standards must be applied (regardless of parcel size).
   A.    Special Preliminary Plat Requirements.
      1.   A topographic map of existing terrain, with contour intervals
adequate to show the nature and variations in the terrain: two (2) foot
intervals for grades less than fifteen percent (15%), and five (5) foot
intervals for grades greater than 15%. The map shall also include elevations of
critical spots, rock outcrops, and special characteristics.
      2.   Where necessary to determine that lots will be usable, a plan for
each lot, in conformance with grading and drainage regulations, showing the
natural topography of the total parcel to be platted, the location and size of
all structures, the finished grade at all improvement locations, and the depth
and extent of all cuts and fills (as recommended by the Department or required
by the Commission).
      3.   A report of a proper soil investigation by a licensed geologist or
engineer to determine any geological hazard and soil bearing quality.
      4.   The location of existing and proposed conservation easements.
   B.    Special Final Plat Requirements.
      1.   A final grading plan which conforms to the requirements of the
grading and drainage regulations in this Chapter and as otherwise required in
this Code.

intervals, or suitable cross sections or profiles of areas where streets,
driveways, buildings, and utility or grading construction are proposed.
      3.   Road profiles and cross sections at all significant changes in the
cross slopes (the cross section to show proposed and natural grades at the
centerline of the road, edge of roadway, the Right-of-Way line, and the
proposed building setback lines).
      4.   Locations of all building sites and proposed driveways.
   C.    Special Design Standards.
      1.   Street and private access way grades shall conform as closely as
possible to natural topography (but shall not exceed 15%).
      2.   Street grades exceeding twelve percent (12%) shall have a maximum
length of six hundred (600) feet.
      3.   Upon approval of the Town Engineer, horizontal alignments may
provide curves with less than one hundred (100) foot centerline radius.
      4.   Upon the recommendation of the Town Engineer (and approval of the
Commission), alternate methods for turning and backing areas may be substituted
for turnarounds.
      5.   Upon approval of the Town Engineer, required paving width of the
traffic lanes may be modified when off-street parking bays are provided,
developed, and paved in the public Right-of-Way.
      6.   The centerline of the paving may be offset from the centerline of
the Right-of-Way to provide parking bays in the Right-of-Way.
      7.   Where bridle trails are approved, sidewalks may be placed by the
trails on the upgrade side of the Right-of-Way.
      8.   Vertical curbs shall be required on the downhill side of streets
having grades of six percent (6%) or greater. Concrete "U" or "V" gutters may
be installed in lieu of conventional rolled or vertical curbs elsewhere.
      9.   On a corner lot, no grading shall be allowed which results in the
ground level being raised so as to obstruct the vision more than a height of
three (3) feet above the grade of either street within an area formed by the
lot lines on the street sides of such lot and a line joining points on such lot
lines located a distance of thirty-three (33) feet from the point of their
intersection.
      10.   Transverse street cross sections, with the gutter on the uphill
side, may be used where approved by the Town Engineer.
      11.   All cut and fill slopes shall be within the roadway Right-of-Way or
roadway easement. Slope maintenance easements for roadway cuts and fills may be
required by the Town Engineer.
      12.   All excavated material shall be removed from lots and roadways or
contained behind retaining walls, or otherwise placed so that the slopes of any
fill material will not be visible from any public street.
      13.   "Panhandle", double-frontage, and other unorthodox lots [including
lots which have a width to depth ratio greater than 1 to 3], shall be permitted
if it can be adequately demonstrated that their design will eliminate excessive
cuts and will not adversely affect any other lot so arranged.
      14.   Private access ways may be permitted to provide access to lots in
lieu of the required street frontage, with a minimum paved surface of twelve
(12) feet in width. Each private access way serving more than one lot shall
have a minimum paved surface of twenty-four (24) feet in width, or as may be
otherwise required by adopted Improvement Standards. Where needed, additional
easements for drainage or utilities shall be provided.

   A.   The financing, constructing and/or acquiring of all on-site and off-
site street and utility improvements required as a condition of Plat approval
in this Article are the responsibility of the Subdivider. Such responsibility
includes, but is not limited to, acquiring the necessary public Rights-of-Way,
easements, and licenses in which such improvements will be constructed or
located, and thereafter dedicating, conveying, assigning, or otherwise
transferring such Rights-of-Way, easements, and licenses to the Town of
Prescott Valley at the time of Plat approval.
   B.   Ownership of all on-site and off-site street and utility improvements
constructed and/or acquired as a condition of Plat approval shall pass to the
owner(s) of or other party(ies) responsible for the street system or the
utility systems being extended thereby, upon written acceptance of the same for
maintenance purposes by such owner(s) or other responsible party(ies), unless
otherwise provided for on the Plat or by express agreement between the
Subdivider and such owner(s) or other party(ies).
   C.   With regard to on-site and off-site street and utility improvements
accepted for maintenance by the Town, Subdividers shall warrant all workmanship
and materials involved in such improvements for a period of two (2) calendar
years from the date of written acceptance. Warranties with regard to
improvements accepted by owners or parties other than the Town may be provided
for by separate agreement between Subdividers and those owners or parties.

been discontinued for any reason, it shall not be resumed until after notifying
the department having jurisdiction.
   B.   All improvements in the public Right-of-Way shall be constructed with
the inspection and approval of the Town department having jurisdiction. The
locations of all utilities to be installed in public Right-of-Way or in private
access ways shall be approved by the Town Engineer.
   C.   All underground utilities to be installed in streets, private access
ways, and alleys shall be constructed under Town permit prior to the surfacing
of such street, private access way, or alley. Service stubs to platted lots
within the Subdivision for underground utilities shall be placed to such length
as not to necessitate disturbance of street improvements when service
connections are made.
   D.   Required on-site improvements shall be extended to the boundaries of
the Plat so as to provide service connections to abutting unsubdivided land.
   E.   Fees for the inspection of all construction activities shall be
estimated by the Town Engineer in accordance with the engineering fee schedule
provided for in Section
16-01-030 of this Code (as amended). These estimated fees shall be paid by the
Subdivider prior to receipt of approval for construction based on the

streets adjacent to the Subdivision, Subdivision streets shall be improved to
the intercepting paving line of such existing streets or to a matching line
determined by the Town Engineer. Transition paving shall be installed as
required by the Town Engineer. When a Subdivision includes an Arterial which is
not paved, or where there is no paved street between the Subdivision and a
paved Arterial or Collector, an interim two (2) lane street at least twenty-
four (24) feet wide shall be constructed to a standard approved by the Town
Engineer on the Arterial, Collector, or Local Street Right-of-Way to the
nearest paved Arterial or Collector. When a Marginal Access Road is required,
strip paving shall be installed for the Arterial traffic lanes. Dead-end
streets extending two hundred (200) feet or more and dead-end marginal access
roads shall be provided a graded and surfaced temporary forty (40) foot radius
turning circle. Alleys shall be graded and surfaced to paved streets.
   B.   Curbs: Where streets are to be paved, a concrete curb, curb and gutter,
or valley gutter (as designated by the Town Engineer) shall be installed in
accordance with adopted Improvement Standards. When density of development is
low (or where, for other reasons such as maintaining a rural atmosphere) the
installation of curb and gutter is not considered necessary, the Council may
waive this requirement for one (1) or both sides of local streets. Vertical
curbs shall be installed on the major street side of a Marginal Access Road,
along Collectors and along school or park property.
   C.   Sidewalks: Concrete sidewalks shall normally be required on both sides
of a Local Street and shall be constructed to a width, line, and grade approved
by the Town Engineer in accordance with adopted Improvement Standards. Where
density of development is low (or where, for other reasons, the installation of
sidewalks is not considered necessary), the Council may waive or modify this
requirement. MUPs shall be required on Arterials and Collectors as identified
in Exhibit CIR-1, in Chapter 8, Circulation Element, of the General Plan (as
amended).
   D.   Street Name Signs and Addresses: Street name signs conforming to the
standards set forth in Section
1-11-050 of this Code (as amended) shall be installed by the Subdivider at all
street intersections and at such other locations as may be determined to be
necessary by the Town Engineer. Such signs must be in place (along with other
traffic control signs to be installed by the Subdivider) by the time the street
pavement is ready for use. Where applicable, address numbers shall also be
installed by the Subdivider, prior to occupancy, in compliance with the
standards set forth in Section
1-11-090 of this Code (as amended).
   E.   Storm Drainage: Grading of private properties, public streets, and
private access ways shall maintain existing major water courses, and those
water courses shall be dedicated as drainage ways. The type, extent, location,
and capacity of drainage facilities for a Subdivision shall be as required by
the Town Engineer from the survey and storm runoff calculations made by the
Subdivider's engineer. All detention basins, channels, and like facilities
shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Town Engineer.
On-site detention shall be required to hold runoff to historic peak levels for
the full range of storm events from the 2-year through the 100-year event. It
is necessary to demonstrate that runoff peaks are maintained at "undeveloped"
levels for the 2-year, 10-year, 25-year and 100-year storm events. In making
these determinations, the Town Engineer shall refer to the policies, design
procedures and safety considerations described in the Yavapai County Drainage
Criteria Manual, 1998, Chapter 5, "Storm Water Storage (Detention/Retention)."
   F.   Types of Drainage Easements:
      1.   Type 1 Drainage Easement
         Drainage Easement intended to facilitate lot-to-lot drainage,
generally established along front, side and rear property lines. Walls, fences
and structures are permitted within a Type 1 Drainage Easement as long as the
surface runoff does not pond onto a neighbor’s property or impede drainage
flows. The property owner shall be responsible for aesthetic maintenance of the
drainage easement and for any and all damage caused by the impedance of storm
water runoff.
      2.   Type 2 Drainage Easement
         Drainage Easement established to convey larger rates of runoff through
constructed drainage facilities such as culverts or channels. Walls, fences, or
structures are not permitted within a Type 2 Drainage Easement. The property
owner shall be responsible for aesthetic maintenance and for any and all damage
caused by the impedance of storm water runoff. The Town will maintain, repair
and/or replace only the major elements of the constructed drainage facilities.
   G.   Sanitary Sewage Disposal: Sewage disposal facilities shall be installed
to serve each lot. Public sanitary sewer lines shall be installed in all new
Subdivisions in accordance with plans, profiles and specifications approved by
appropriate Town departments as set forth in
Chapter 9 of this Code.
   H.   Water Supply: Each lot shall be supplied with safe, pure and potable
water in sufficient volume and pressure for domestic use and fire protection.
Wells, water pumps, water tanks, water mains, water lines, fire hydrants, and
any installations required by the Uniform Fire Code (as adopted from time to
time by any agency having jurisdiction within the Town) shall be installed in
all new Subdivisions in accordance with plans, profiles and specifications
approved by appropriate Town departments and connected to the public water
system.
   I.   Monuments: Permanent monuments shall be installed in accordance with
adopted Improvement Standards at all corners, angle points, and points of
curve, at all street intersections, and at all corners, angle points, and
points of curve of all conservation easements. After all improvements have been
installed, a registered land surveyor or engineer shall check the location of
the monuments and certify their accuracy.
   J.   Lot Corners: Iron pipes shall be set at all corners, angle points, and
points of curve for each lot within the Subdivision prior to the recording of
the Plat.
   K.   Utilities:
      1.   New electric cable and other telecommunication lines shall be
installed underground. When overhead utility lines exist within the property
being platted, said existing overhead utility lines and the new installations
within the platted area shall be placed underground. When overhead utility
lines exist on the periphery of the property being platted, said existing
overhead utility lines (and any additions or replacements needed to increase
capacity or improve service reliability) may remain overhead. Provided,
however, that any service drops into the platted area from said peripheral
overhead lines shall be underground. When overhead utility lines exist on the
periphery of the property of five (5) acres or less being platted, then the
utility lines within the platted area may be overhead. When, as a result of the
Subdivision development, it is necessary to relocate, renew, or expand existing
facilities within the platted area, the Subdivider shall make the necessary
arrangements with the serving utility for these installations to be placed
underground. The Subdivider shall arrange with the serving utility for, and be
responsible for, the cost of underground service lines to approved street light
locations.
      2.   The Subdivider shall be responsible for the requirements of this
Section and shall make the necessary arrangements with each of the serving
utility companies involved for the installation of the underground facilities.
Letters from each of the serving utility companies indicating that said
arrangements have been made shall be submitted to the Town Engineer at the time
the Final Plat is submitted for approval. When due to subsurface soil
conditions or other special conditions it is determined by the Town Engineer
that it is impractical to construct facilities underground, installations shall
be overhead. Those electric lines of greater than three thousand (3,000) IVA
(Kilovolt Ampers) capacity (as rated by the American Standard Association) are
excluded from the requirements of this Section.
   L.   Street Lights: Street lights shall be provided in accordance with
Article 13-26a of this Code. Furthermore, in Subdivisions where all other
utilities are installed underground, underground electrical service required
for street lighting shall be installed to those street light locations approved
by the Town Engineer.
   M.   Walls on Landscape and Vehicular Non-access Easements: Continuous
undulating or offset decorative masonry walls shall be installed on landscape
and vehicular non-access easements along Arterials if lots back up to said
Arterials.
   N.   Landscaping: All landscaping (along with appropriate watering systems)
within public Rights-of-Way or landscape easements shall be in accordance with
plans approved by the Town Engineer.

14-04-070   Public Improvement Reimbursement Agreements.
   A.    Purpose. Inasmuch as it may be in the public interest to extend public
improvements to undeveloped areas in the Town (or for one (1) development to
size certain public improvements larger than would otherwise be necessary for
that development so as to better accommodate nearby development, the Town
Manager is hereby authorized to require that Subdividers either extend certain
improvements off-site to connect with existing improvements or upsize certain
on or off-site improvements to facilitate connection thereto by other
developments.
   B.    Agreements. In the event the Town Manager requires such extensions of
off-site improvements or upsizing of on or off-site improvements, he may
propose to the Town Council 1 or more agreements with the Subdividers whereby
the additional costs will ultimately be reimbursed from buy-in fees charged to
other developers that later benefit from connecting to such improvements. Such
agreements may either require the Subdivider to advance the costs (and then be
reimbursed from buy-in fees charged to later developers by the Town and
reimbursed to the Subdivider) or provide for up-front Town payment of the costs
and later reimbursement to the Town from buy-in fees charged to later
developers by the Town. The Manager’s determination as to which agreement shall
be presented to the Town Council shall be guided by development agreements,
considerations involved with zoning approvals, or by any other benefits
accruing to Subdividers.
   C.   Form and Effect of Agreements. The approval of any such agreements to
reimburse some or all costs of off-site improvement extensions or upsizing of
on or off-site improvements shall have the effect of authorizing the Town to
impose buy-in fees to later developers who connect to such improvements, as set
forth in the agreements. Said agreements may address the following:
      1.   Whether or not the improvement must be competitively bid in
accordance with ARS § 34-201 (as amended);
      2.   When and according to what processes the improvement becomes the
property of the Town;
      3.   Whether and to what extent any improvement district assessments, in-
lieu of assessment fees, connection charges, or development fees charged to
Subdividers will be offset by the extra costs of the improvement incurred by
Subdividers;
      4.   Whether and to what extent Subdividers shall be reserved a specific
amount of capacity in the improvement;
      5.   After accounting for any offsets for the extra costs to Subdividers
(and any capacity in the improvement reserved to Subdividers), what capacity in
the improvement will remain available for use or connection by other developers
(for which Subdividers should be reimbursed). Note that engineering costs may
be included as reimbursable costs.
      6.   The reasonable buy-in fee to charge other developers who use or
connect to the improvement.
      7.   How such buy-in fees shall be paid to the Town and repaid to
Subdividers after deduction of a reasonable administrative fee by the Town.
      8.   That the total of such repayments shall not exceed the amount
established in Subparagraph
14-04-070(C)(5) above (as amended), and may be less if sufficient buy-in fees
are not collected during the term of the agreement.
      9.   The term of any such agreement.
      10.   That the Town has the option to reimburse Subdividers with a credit
against development fees, connection charges, improvement district assessments,
or in-lieu of assessment fees imposed by the Town (in which case the Town shall
reimburse the appropriate fund accounts with the applicable buy-in fees
collected).
      11.   How and under what circumstances the agreement may be assigned to
successors-in-interest.
      12.   That such agreements shall be recorded in the Office of the Yavapai
County Recorder.
   D.    General Requirements. All required extensions of off-site improvements
or upsizing of on- or off-site improvements shall be constructed in accordance
with adopted Improvement Standards. Upon approval and acceptance of said
extensions or upsized improvements by the Town Engineer, the same shall be
dedicated by appropriate instrument to the Town and the Town shall exercise
exclusive control over who may connect to or use the same and the procedures
therefor.
   E.    Offset. Buy-in fees paid by other developers as a result of such
reimbursement agreements with Subdividers may be offset, in whole or in part,
against any development fees, connection charges, improvement district
assessments, or in-lieu of assessment fees charged those other developers for
such improvements.
(Ord. No. 357, Enacted, 03/23/95; Ord. No. 389, Amended, 07/11/96; Ord. No.
801, Amended, 02/12/15)
14-04-080   Assurances by Subdivider.
   A.   Agreement by Subdivider.
      Upon approval by the Town of the Final Plat, the Subdivider shall execute
an agreement covering the following:
      1.   The Subdivision improvements in a recorded development unit may be
constructed in practical increments of lots, as specified by the Subdivider,
subject to provisions for satisfactory drainage, traffic movements, and other
services as determined by the Town Engineer.
      2.   The improvements, except those utility facilities specified in this
Chapter, shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Town
Engineer and the appropriate Town department for water and public sanitary
sewer facilities, and by the Town Engineer for all other improvements. If
location of the development so requires, water and sanitary sewer facilities
shall also be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the appropriate
State and County departments.
      3.   The improvements, except those utility facilities specified in this
Chapter, shall be completed within an agreed specified time period for each
increment. An extension of time may be granted under conditions specified
therein.
      4.   The Subdivider shall give adequate assurance of the construction of
each increment in accordance with this Chapter. In the event the required
assurances are not provided, any lots or parcels for which the assurances have
not been delivered shall automatically revert to un-platted land and the
Subdivider agrees that the necessary Reversionary Plats may be recorded to
formalize such reversion.
      5.   Progress payments may be made to the Subdivider on his order from
any cash deposit made. Such progress payments shall be made in accordance with
standards established by the Town Engineer.
      6.   Any work abandoned or not completed by the Subdivider may be
completed by the Town which shall recover the construction costs from the
Subdivider.
      7.   Construction of all improvements within streets and easements,
except those utility facilities specified in this Chapter, shall be subject to
inspection by the Town Engineer.
      8.   No lots shall be released from the approved increment of lots until
either the agreement or an assurance of construction has been posted and
accepted by the Town Engineer.
      9.   With regard to on-site and off-site street and utility improvements
accepted for maintenance by the Town, the Subdivider shall warrant all
workmanship and materials involved in such improvements for a period of two (2)
calendar years after the date of written acceptance.
   B.   Assurances of Improvement Construction.
      1.   Cash or Surety Bond. To ensure construction of the required
improvements as set forth in this Chapter (except specified utility
facilities), the Subdivider may deposit with the Town Engineer an amount in
cash or a surety bond equal to the amount of the cost of the work of each
recorded increment (as determined by the Town Engineer) guaranteeing that the
work will be completed in accordance with adopted Improvement Standards. When
no Marginal Access Road is being constructed and the improvement of an Arterial
or Collector by a governmental agency is imminent, the Subdivider shall deposit
the current estimated cost of improving the abutting half street in an account
to be disbursed to the Town at the time the contract is awarded for the Town
project to improve the full width of the street.
         a.   Any surety bond shall be executed by the Subdivider, as
principal, with a corporation duly authorized to transact surety business in
the State of Arizona as surety. The bond shall be in favor of the Town, shall
be continuous in form, and shall require that the total aggregate liability of
the surety for all claims shall be limited to the face amount of the bond,
regardless of the number of years the bond is in force. The bond or cash shall
be released upon satisfactory performance of the work and its acceptance by the
Town Engineer. The bond may be canceled or the cash withdrawn by the Subdivider
provided that other security satisfactory to the Town has been deposited which
will cover the obligations of the Subdivider which remain to be performed.
      2.    Loan Commitment. The Subdivider may provide assurance of
construction of required improvements (except those utility facilities
specified in this Chapter) by delivering to the Department, prior to the
recording of the Final Plat, an appropriate agreement between an approved
lending institution and the Subdivider stating that funds sufficient to cover
the entire cost of installing the required improvements (including engineering
and inspection costs in an amount approved by the Town Engineer) have been
deposited with such approved lending institution. The agreement shall provide
that the funds in the approved amount are specifically allocated and will be
used by the Subdivider, or on his behalf, only for the purpose of installing
the Subdivision improvements. The Town shall be the beneficiary of such
agreement (or the Subdivider's rights thereunder shall be assigned to the Town
and the Town Engineer shall approve each disbursement for such funds). The
agreement may also contain terms, conditions, and provisions normally included
by such lending institutions in loan commitments for construction funds (or as
may be necessary to comply with statutes and regulations applicable to such
lending institutions).
      3.    Trust Agreement. The Subdivider may provide assurance of
construction of required improvements (except those utility facilities
specified in this Chapter) by placing on deposit in a trust account with a bank
or trust company, in the name of the Town, a sum of money equal to the
estimated cost of all such improvements (as set by the Town Engineer). Said
trust shall be approved as to form and substance by the Town Attorney. Periodic
withdrawals may be made from the trust account for progressive payment of
installation costs based upon estimates approved by the Town Engineer and
approved by the appointed trustee.
      4.    Title Hold. Title to the property being developed by the subdivider
may be placed in trust with a third-party escrow agency. The terms of the trust
shall be that the trustee may not convey title to any portion of the property
until the improvements for that portion have been satisfactorily completed as
determined by the Town Engineer. The form and substance of the trust agreement
shall be approved by the Town Attorney.
      5.   Construction At-Risk. If the Subdivider desires to construct
required improvements at-risk (without posting assurances), the Town Council
may agree to do so in the Subdivision agreement and may conditionally approve
the Final Plat on that basis. Nevertheless, in no circumstance will the Final
Plat be recorded by Town staff until all improvements have been constructed in
accordance with adopted Improvement Standards as determined in writing by the
Town Engineer.
   C.   Administration of Assurances.
      1.   Documents creating the assurances described herein shall include a
term of at least 2 years and shall provide for extensions of time in one (1)
year increments. Said documents shall further provide that the assurance shall
remain in full force and effect until it is released in writing by the Town
Engineer.
      2.   Upon certification by the Subdivider’s engineer of record, the Town
Engineer may partially release an assurance for successful completion of a
portion of the required improvements as determined by the Town Engineer. The
Town Engineer may require that any remaining assurances provide for preparation
of necessary as-built drawings for all of the improvements.
      3.   In the event the Subdivider defaults or fails or neglects to
satisfactorily install the required improvements within the time set forth in
the Subdivision agreement, the Town Engineer may declare the assurance
forfeited and, under the terms thereof, the Town may make or cause the
remaining required improvements to be made using the resources in said
assurance. In addition, the Town Engineer may notify the Arizona Department of
Real Estate of the Subdivider’s default.
      4.   At the conclusion of the construction of improvements (or thirty
(30) days prior to the term of the assurance, whichever is sooner) the
Subdivider’s engineer of record shall submit a set of as-built drawings of the
improvements. The Town Engineer will review said drawings and notify the
Subdivider of any noncompliance with the approved construction plans or this
Chapter. It shall be the responsibility of the engineer of record to finalize
said as-built drawings as part of the final approval of the improvements by the
Town Engineer.

         a.   Painted temporary markings shall be installed at the locations
where thermoplastic markings are required.
      5.   Recessed Pavement markers shall be installed on all new pavement
projects.
      6.   Where new markings must match existing markings (and obliteration is
necessary), obliteration shall be accomplished by water blasting or similar
approved methods. The area shall be sealed with slurry per MAG Standard with
emulsified asphalt slurry type II (or as directed by the inspector).
         a.   Verification shall be sought of timing for any slurry application
in order to coordinate installation of new thermoplastic markings.
      7.   Marking obliteration may need to go beyond designated project
limits. Thus, obliteration shall extend as needed to allow appropriate matching
of new markings with existing markings. Painting over markings does not
constitute marking obliteration.
         a.   Marking obliteration shall be done according to approved industry
standards with minimal damage to pavement/chip seal surfaces. Sandblasting is
not allowed.
      8.   Existing markings shall be removed if they have become too thick,
have lost adhesion to the surface, or are of an incompatible material (or if
the marking layout is being reconfigured).
         a.   Removal of existing markings shall only be by methods set forth
in the applicable marking standards.
      9.   Marking dimensions are to the center of stripe for single lines and
to the center of the space between two (2) lines for double lines (except that,
where curb and gutter are present, the dimension is taken from the gutter
line).
      10.   All symbols and word legends shall be Pre-formed Markings.
      11.   The following marking dimensions shall apply:
         a.   Lane Lines: four-inch (4”) or six-inch (6”) broken white or
yellow line; ten-foot (10’) stripe with thirty-foot (30’) gap.
         b.   Guide or Lane Drop: 6” white two-foot (2’) stripe four-foot (4’)
space; eight-inch (8”) white 2’ stripe 4’ space.

shoulder or centerline); 6” double yellow line; twelve-inch (12)” solid white
line next to turn lanes; eight-inch (8”) solid white line next to bike lanes.
         c.   Two-Way Turn Lanes: 6” solid yellow line and 6” broken yellow
line at 10’ stripe with 30’ space.
         d.   Turn Bays: 12” solid white line.
         e.   Widths: 4” temporary striping; 6” lane lines; 6” bike lanes; 8”
turn lanes; 12” crosswalks; eighteen-inch (18”) stop bars.
         Note: These requirements may be modified in the case of particular
Marking Plan approvals (or by inspectors on-site) where circumstances require.
   E.   1.   Standard Details adopted in Subsection
16-01-020(B) above include typical road cross sections for marking. They are
intended to illustrate typical markings associated with each roadway
classification’s standard cross section. Where existing roadway pavement/chip
seal widths do not allow pavement marking to be installed per said standards,
Marking Plans should reference other potentially applicable standards.
      2.   Where applicable, the guidelines developed by Lee Engineering for
the Town regarding crosswalk marking should be followed.

(Ord. No. 457, Enacted, 04/08/99)
16-02-040   Minimum Requirements.
Off-site improvements shall be required for all projects as established by the
Town Engineer in conjunction with the Development Services Director and in
conformance with the following minimum requirements:
   A.   Rights-of-Way: If, as determined by the Prescott Valley Planning and
Zoning Commission, the property to be developed does not have adequate rights-
of-way to facilitate intensified use, or will not accommodate proposed or
contemplated public improvements or drainage, then necessary rights-of-way and/
or drainage-ways shall be granted to the Town. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may impose special building setback requirements to assure clear
space for future right-of-way needs. Public rights- of-way or public utility
easements must be provided for all public improvements which are or will become
property of the Town.
   B.   Water: Water lines sized for the development in accordance with Town
standards and, if required by the Town Engineer, such lines shall be extended
across the full front, side, and/or rear of the property being developed.
   C.   Sanitary Sewer: Sanitary sewer lines sized for the development in
accordance with standards and, if required by the Town Engineer, such lines
shall be extended across the full front, side, and/or rear of the property
being developed.
   D.   Drainage: Drainage plans and improvements shall be required in
accordance with Town grading and drainage standards and flood plain
regulations.
   E.   Street Improvements: Street improvements, including a minimum of one
(1) full traffic lane, shall be constructed across the full property front,
side, and rear which is adjacent to an existing or newly- dedicated Town
street, right-of-way, or dedicated access.
      1.   If such Town street, right-of-way or dedicated access has been
designated as a Federal Aid Urban Collector or Arterial street, half-street
improvements shall be required. Half-street improvements shall consist of curb
and gutter, sidewalk or bicycle path and drainage facilities to Town standards,
constructed on the side of the street adjoining the property being developed.
      2.   Full street improvements shall be required for any multi-residential
or non-residential construction, or addition thereto in excess of 50% of the
base square footage located adjacent to and served by a newly-dedicated Town
street right-of-way, such dedication completed on behalf of the property being
developed. Full street improvement shall consist of the construction of a
street section, including grading, base course, pavement, curb and gutter,
sidewalk or bicycle path and drainage facilities to Town standards, constructed
the full width of the right-of-way and on both sides of the street.
      3.   Where the property being developed is separate from an existing
improved public street by an unimproved section of public street, the Town may
construct street improvements thereby making the property being developed
adjacent to an existing improved public street. If the Town elects to construct
the street improvements, it will construct the street improvements at a time
that will coincide with the construction of the street improvements required of
the property being developed.
      4.   When property access is necessary or proposed via an alley, as the
result of a new development or a change of use, full width alley improvements
shall be constructed along the alley frontage according to Town standards.
Alley improvements shall also be extended to the nearest public street if no
such improved connection, in whole or part, presently exists.
   F.   Driveway and Town Right-of-Way Access: Surfacing shall extend off-site
to meet existing Town street surfacing, or a distance designated by the Town
Engineer at which future Town street surfacing will meet the driveway
surfacing. All driveway culvert ends shall be protected from crushing or other
damage by conforming with Town standards and/or by obtaining Town Engineer
approval.
      1.   A single-family residence is not required to surface driveways and
parking areas; however, if surfacing is provided, it shall extend off-site to
existing or future Town street surfacing.
      2.   Any multi-family residential or non-residential construction shall
install surfacing on all driveway areas connecting on-site parking with the
Town street, extending off-site to existing or future Town street surfacing.
   G.   Street Lighting: Street lighting plans and improvements shall be
required in accordance with Town standards.
   H.   Fire Hydrant Installation: Fire hydrant installation shall be provided
pursuant to Central Yavapai Fire District requirements and in accordance with
Town standards.
   I.    Town Acquisition of Right-of-Way: When it is necessary to improve a
street and sufficient right- of-way is not available from other area property
owners not subject to the provisions of this Article, the Development Services
Director may, with the approval of the Town Council, obtain the right-of-way
upon terms that are equitable to the property owner and the Town, including
assumption by the Town of all or part of the costs of street improvements.
   J.   Traffic-Related Off-Site Improvements: The Planning and Zoning
Commission may require, as a consideration of development approval, that
certain developments perform, and submit for approval, a Traffic Impact
Analysis (TIA).
      1.   When the approved TIA identifies impacts to the public road system,
as a result of the proposed development, impact mitigation is required. Design
and construction of improvements that mitigate the identified impacts shall be
approved by the Town Engineer and constructed by the developer.
      2.   All required improvements identified in the TIA must be wholly
attributable to the impact created by the development.
   K.   Other Improvements: Including, but not limited to, the extension and
installation of power and/or communications utilities, as may be required by
the Town Engineer.

specifications, covering a sufficient geographical area to permit informed
engineering analysis, are still required as a prerequisite to the issuance of a
building permit by the Building Official.
(Ord. No. 457, Enacted, 04/08/99)
16-02-060   Completion/Waiver and Assurance of Performance.
The required off-site improvements shall be completed, waived or secured by
financial assurance of performance as a prerequisite to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy by the Building Official. The Town may, as an
incentive for desired types of development, provide certain, off-site
improvements; however, such incentive shall be provided only as specified in a
development agreement approved by the Town Council.
   A.   Completion: Improvements will be considered complete when they have
been inspected and accepted by the Town Engineer, who shall certify in writing
to the Building Official that the completed off-site improvements have been
constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. As-built
information must be submitted to and accepted by the Town Engineer prior to the
issuance of the certification of acceptance of off-site improvements by the
Town Engineer.
   B.   Waiver of Off-Site Improvements: When, in the opinion of the Town
Engineer, the installation of any of the off-site improvements will create a
drainage or maintenance problem if installed prior to future improvements of
other properties in the immediate vicinity, waiver of the installation may be
directed by the Town or may be considered at the request of the property owner.
      1.   The Town Engineer, upon the approval of the Town Council, may waive
the installation of the off-site improvements.
      2.   The waiver becomes effective when, prior to such improvement, there
is deposited in cash with the Town by, or on behalf of, the property owner the
amount estimated by the Town Engineer to pay the cost of the installation of
such off-site improvements waived.
      3.   All sums thus deposited shall be used by the Town to defray the cost
of such future installation of the required off-site improvements, and when
thus installed the portion of such deposit exceeding the cost of said
installation of the off-site improvements shall be refunded, without interest,
to the person making the deposit.
      4.   All cash sums thus collected by the Town shall be utilized within
ten (10) years for construction of the approved off-site improvement plans or
such funds shall be refunded, without interest, to the person making the
deposit.
   C.   Assurance of Performance: Subject to approval by the Town Engineer and
Town Attorney, the following alternatives for assurance of performance are
available to the developer:
      1.    Cash Deposit. The developer may fulfill the public improvement
requirement by a cash deposit. A separate accounting for the cash deposit will
be maintained by the Town; however, the developer does not accrue interest on
this type of assurance.
      2.   Certificate of Deposit. The developer may provide a certificate of
deposit (automatically renewable) as assurance of construction for the off-site
improvements required. The certificate of deposit must be accompanied by an
“Assignment of Certificate of Deposit and Acknowledgment by Issuer” form. Upon
discharge of the obligation, the interest accrued would be returned to the
developer along with the certificate of deposit.
