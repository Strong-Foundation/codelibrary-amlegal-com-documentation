or the denial of the application.
 
   H.   If the city manager proposes to grant a license application, the city
manager and the applicant must agree on the terms of a license agreement within
sixty (60) days from the notice of the proposed grant. This period may be
extended for good cause by the city manager. If agreement is not reached within
sixty (60) days or if the period is not extended, the notice of proposed grant
is void.
 
   I.   The city must make the text of a proposed license agreement available
to the public. A summary of the terms of a proposed license agreement must be

All insurance policies must be with sureties qualified to do business in
Arizona and in a form approved by the city attorney. The city may accept a
self-insurance plan that assures comparable protection in lieu of these
insurance policies.
 
   B.   A licensee must, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend the city, its officials, boards, commissions, agents, and
employees, against any claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and
judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction,
maintenance, or operation of its cable system regardless of whether the act or
omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the license.
This requirement includes claims arising out of copyright infringement or a
failure by the licensee to secure consent from the owner, authorized
distributor, or licensee of a program to be delivered by the cable system.

appellate proceedings), relating to, arising out of, or alleged to have
resulted either wholly or in part from the acts, errors, mistakes, omissions,
work or services of the licensee, its agents, employees, contractors or
subcontractors in the performance of this agreement, and regardless of whether
or not such claim, damages, loss or expenses are caused in part by the city of
Eloy.
 
   E.   Licensee(s) duty to defend, hold harmless and indemnify the city of
Eloy, its agents, officers, officials and employees shall arise in connection

destruction of property including loss of use resulting there from, caused
either wholly or in part by licensee's acts, errors, mistakes, omissions, work
or services in the performance of this agreement including any employee of the
licensee or any other person for whose acts, errors, mistakes, omissions, work
or services the licensee may be legally liable, and regardless of whether or
not such claim, damages, losses or expenses are caused in part by the city of
Eloy.
 
   F.   The amount and type of insurance coverage requirements set forth herein
will in no way be construed as limiting the scope of the indemnity in this
section. (Ord. 05-589, 5-23-2005)

5A-12: LICENSE FEE:
 
   A.   A licensee, in consideration of the privilege granted under a license
for the use of public rights of way to construct and operate a cable system,
must pay the city five percent (5%) of the licensee's gross revenues within its
license area during the period of its license. A licensee must pay the license
fee due to the city for the preceding quarter within thirty (30) days of the
end of that quarter.
 
   B.   Any payment of license fees to adjust for a shortfall in the quarterly
payments for the preceding year must be made no later than the filing date for
the annual financial statements as specified in subsection D of this section.
An adjustment for any overpayment will be credited in one or more subsequent
quarterly payments.
 
   C.   Unless a license agreement provides otherwise, a licensee must file
with the city within thirty (30) days of the end of each quarter a financial
statement showing the gross revenues received by the licensee during the
preceding quarter and the number of subscribers.
 
   D.   A licensee must file within three (3) months of the end of its fiscal
year the licensee's or the licensee parent's annual financial statements for
the preceding year audited by a certified public accountant. The licensee will
bear the cost of the preparation of all financial statements.
 
   E.   The city may inspect and audit any books and records relevant to the
calculation of gross revenues, and recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under the license. The reasonable cost of the audit, up to the amount
determined to be due to the city, will be borne by the licensee if the annual
payment to the city for the preceding year is increased by more than three
percent (3%) as a result of the audit.
 
   F.   In the event that a license payment is not received by the city on or
before the due date, interest will be charged from the due date at the annual
interest rate then charged for unpaid federal income taxes. In addition, the
licensee will pay a late charge of five percent (5%) of the amount of the
payment. Interest and late charges will not be imposed for any payment
necessary as a result of the yearly adjustment provided for in subsection D of
this section, if the payment to correct for a shortfall does not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the total payments made during the year. In the event such
payment exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total payments made during the year,
the licensee will be liable for interest and late charges for the entire amount
due.
 
   G.   When a license terminates for any reason, the licensee must file with
the city within ninety (90) days of the date the license operations stop an
audited financial statement showing the gross revenues received by the licensee
since the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments must be made at that

causes any substantial interruption to subscriber's service, the grantee must
make reasonable efforts to notify subscribers within thirty (30) days prior to
such testing and possible interruption. This notification includes, but is not
limited to, notification by character generator on the cable system, or
neighborhood flyers in the areas to be tested. Insofar as feasible, licensee

afforded to the city in law or equity; provided, however, that the city may
institute revocation proceedings against licensee only after declaration of
default, pursuant to subsection F of this section and only on the grounds set

      3.   The cable operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability
to provide the services, facilities, and equipment in its proposal; and
 
      4.   The cable operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable
related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting
the needs and interests.

submit a proposal for renewal of a license under 626(h) of the cable act. The
city must hold one or more public hearing or provide some other procedure for
public comment on the proposal. After the public hearing or comment period, the
city manager must recommend that the council grant or deny the license renewal
and the terms and conditions of any recommended renewal. A denial under this
subsection shall not affect licensee's renewal rights under subsections 626(a)
through (g) of the cable act.

the licensee; provided that, any financing arrangement, including, but not
limited to, a mortgage or pledge, shall not be deemed a "transfer".
 
   C.   An entity, which seeks approval of a proposed transfer, shall file an
application for approval of that transfer no later than one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the proposed effective date of the transfer. In making a

waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or the
license agreement. (Ord. 05-589, 5-23-2005)
 
 
5A-23: REVOCATION OR TERMINATION OF LICENSE:

manager and with the approval of the council, for failure to construct,
operate, or maintain the cable system as required by this chapter or the
license agreement, or for some other material breach of this chapter or the
license agreement. If the city has issued a license specifically conditioned
upon the completion of construction or other specific obligations by a
specified date under subsection
5A-9C of this chapter, failure of the licensee to complete construction or
comply with other specific obligations as required will result in the automatic
forfeiture of the license without further action by the city. However, the
city, at its discretion and for good cause shown by the licensee, may grant an
extension of time. The city must give a licensee written notice that it is in
material breach of this chapter or the license agreement. If the licensee does
not correct the breach within thirty (30) days of the notice, or corrective
action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city may give
written notice to the licensee of its intent to revoke the license. The city
must give the licensee written notice of the basis for a revocation, stating
its reasons.
 
   B.   The council must hold a public hearing, and then determine by written
resolution whether or not to revoke the license based the recommendations of
the city manager, information presented at the public hearing, and other
evidence in the record. The resolution must include reasons for the council's
decision.
 
   C.   The city may revoke any license one hundred twenty (120) days after an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or
trustee to take over the business of the licensee, whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other
action or proceeding. The city must hold a public hearing before revoking a
license under this subsection. The city may not revoke a license under this
subsection if, during the one hundred twenty (120) day period:
 
      1.   The assignment, receivership, or trusteeship is vacated; or
 
      2.   The assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms
and conditions of this chapter and the license agreement and has executed an
agreement, approved by the court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to
be bound by the terms, and conditions of the license.
 
   D.   The city may revoke the license if there is a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a licensee, by
serving notice on the licensee and the successful bidder at the sale. The

and conditions of the license.
 
      2.   The successful bidder has agreed with the city to assume and be
bound by the terms and conditions of the license.

abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers, the city may:

at the licensee's or surety's expense, or at the expense of both, after
determining that the cable system cannot be economically maintained and
operated.
 
      2.   Acquire ownership of the cable system at an equitable market price
on the recommendation of the city manager and with the approval of the council.
 
      3.   After a public hearing, sell, assign, or transfer all or part of the
assets of a cable system abandoned by a licensee for the best price offer
obtainable. However, the legal, character, financial, technical, and other
qualifications of the purchaser must meet city approval. The city must pay any
consideration received in excess of the city's costs, and after other creditors
and subscriber claims have been satisfied, to the original licensee. (Ord. 05-
589, 5-23-2005)
 
 
5A-24: CONTINUITY OF SERVICE MANDATORY:
 
   A.   It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services
from the licensee if their financial and other obligations to the licensee are
satisfied.
 
   B.   If the license is terminated, the licensee must do everything in its
power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service.
The licensee must cooperate with the city to operate the system for a
transition period following termination as necessary to maintain continuity of
service to all subscribers. The transition period must not exceed twelve (12)
months without the licensee's written consent. During the transition period,
the cable system must be operated under terms and conditions to which the city
and the licensee agree, or on such other terms and conditions that will
continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and
that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator.
 
   C.   If the licensee discontinues service to its subscribers without city
approval, the license may be terminated immediately, and the city may take
possession of all facilities and property, real and personal, related to the
cable system for the purpose of operating the system. The city may undertake
such operation itself or authorize operation by a contractor. (Ord. 05-589, 5-

observations are made at the beginning and the end of the fifteen (15) minute
averaging period and that there are at least as many additional observations as
there are decibels between the highest high indication and the lowest low
indication.
   C.   Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency
indications.
DECIBEL: A sound pressure that is twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base
ten (10) of the ratio of the pressure of sound to the reference pressure, 2 x

time for which the function repeats itself.
PERIODIC QUANTITY: Oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal
increments of time.
PURE TONE NOISE: Any noise which is distinctly audible as a single pitch
(frequency) or set of pitches as determined by the enforcement officer.
SOUND LEVEL: "Sound level" (noise level), in decibels (dB), is the sound
measured with the A-weighting and slow response by a sound level meter.
SOUND LEVEL METER: An instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an
output meter, and frequency weighting networks for the measurement of sound
levels which satisfies the pertinent requirements in American standard
specifications for sound level meters S1.4-1971 or the most recent revision

   B.   Any and all liability and/or consequential damage or loss resulting
from the failure of the Police Department to respond to an alarm dispatch
request is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is
fully retained.
   C.   By applying for an alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges that
police response to an alarm activation is influenced by the availability of
officers, priority of current calls for service, traffic and/or weather
conditions and staffing levels. (Ord. 17-871, 8-14-2017)

occurs shall be posted with a notice stating:
         a.   That an unruly gathering has occurred at the premises;
         b.   The date of the unruly gathering;
         c.   That any subsequent unruly gathering on the same premises within
a one hundred eighty (180) day period shall result in liability for the

posting shall be extended to one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the
subsequent posting. Once a premises is initially posted as a result of an

provisions of this section. The petition must be filed within ten (10) days
after the posting of the notice or, if the notice is given by mail, within

thereafter. The court shall set a time and date for a hearing to be held no
later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written petition and shall
notify both the petitioner and the criminal division of the city attorney's
office of the hearing date. In order to avoid the possibility of conflicting
rulings, if more than one petition is filed under this subsection relating to a
single posting, for example by multiple lawful occupants of the posted
premises, the court shall set only one hearing and shall consolidate the
petitions and notify all petitioners of the hearing date and time. At the
hearing, the city has the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that
the posting of the notice was justified pursuant to the provisions of this
section.
         b.   An owner of a posted premises, at any time after the posting or
the mailing of the notice, may petition the court for an order directing the
removal of the notice on the grounds that the owner has taken reasonable and
necessary actions, such as evicting a tenant responsible for the violation, to
prevent the occurrence of a subsequent unruly gathering at the posted location.
The court shall set a time and date for a hearing to be held no later than
fifteen (15) days after receipt of the petition and shall notify both the
petitioner and the criminal division of the city attorney's office of the
hearing date. At the hearing, the petitioner has the burden of proving by a
preponderance of evidence that the petitioner has taken reasonable and
necessary actions to prevent the occurrence of a subsequent unruly gathering.

regulates the use of the premises, if known. Notice to the owner's agent may be
provided by hand delivery or by certified or regular mail sent to the agent's
last known address.

subsection shall not invalidate any citation or other proceedings as to any
other person duly served, or relieve any such person from any duty imposed by

express or implied consent of the owner, occupant, tenant, or sponsor, as long
as the owner, occupant, tenant or sponsor has taken steps reasonably necessary
to prevent a subsequent unruly gathering or to exclude the uninvited persons
from the premises, including owners who are actively attempting to evict a
tenant from the premises. Where an invited person engages in unlawful conduct

and recorded, have been sold within five (5) years from the date of
recordation, or if none of the improvements have been made in accordance with
the assurance for completion of improvements, the City Council may, on its own
motion, hold a public hearing after notice to determine whether the approval of

streets, rights-of-way and easements dedicated or offer for dedication by such
plat shall be of no further force or effect.

provided by all the owners of lots in such plat, by petitioning the Council for

thereof, shall be documented by resolution, and said resolution shall be

the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, alleys,
and public grounds, and all dedications or easements laid out or described in
such plat except as specifically identified in the resolution.
   F.   In modifying the standards or requirements of this chapter, as outlined
above, the Council may make such additional requirements as appear necessary,
in its judgment, to secure substantially the objectives of the standards or
requirements so modified. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)

         a.   Eloy Community Development Department.
         b.   Eloy Public Works Department.

parks, open space or other public facility needs for the area as determined by
the Eloy General Plan; to then determine what space needs shall be reserved or
set aside with any special requirements for such site. Review for compliance
with this chapter and any other applicable regulations.

right-of-way requirements, intersection relationships and other traffic control
related characteristics. Identify possible off site public improvements and
dedications. Review the wastewater disposal system.

15-3-4: STAGE 3; DEVELOPMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE REVIEW:
In order for a preliminary plat to be scheduled for a particular Development
Review Committee (DRC) meeting, a complete preliminary plat application must be
received and accepted by the City.
   A.   The City shall host a Development Review Committee (DRC) meeting where
the applicant is provided an opportunity to meet with representatives from all
applicable City departments, utilities and other interested governmental
agencies to receive comments regarding the preliminary plat application. At
this meeting the applicant may also receive written comments from the City
within ten (10) working days from the DRC meeting date, detailing the extent to
which the plans are required to be revised in order for the City to schedule
the preliminary plat for consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Extensive revisions caused by the comments received at the DRC meeting or by
voluntary action of the applicant, may require additional DRC meetings.
Additionally, circumstances may exist where the project may experience delay
due to the applicant's time line in addressing agency comments. (Ord. 18-879,
7-23-2018)
15-3-5: STAGE 4; PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL:
The preliminary plat approval stage involves the resubmission of the
preliminary plat to address the DRC comments. Included in this stage is the
review of the resubmitted plans, reports, and required studies and acceptance
of the preliminary plat. The subdivider shall provide the City with all
information essential to determine the character and general acceptability of
the proposed development.
   A.   Preliminary Plat Resubmission:
      1.   The applicant shall resubmit fifteen (15) full sized copies/sets of
the preliminary plat, one (1) eight and one-half inch by eleven inch (81/2" x
11") transparency of each sheet/exhibit, and one (1) eight and one-half inch by
eleven inch (81/2" x 11") pdf of each sheet/exhibit and all other required or
requested supporting data to the City. Preliminary plats that correctly contain
all of the information requested or required by the Development Review
Committee (DRC), as determined by the City, shall be scheduled for Planning and
Zoning Commission consideration. Incomplete or incorrect resubmittals could
cause delays in a preliminary plat being presented to the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Scheduling of the case for commission consideration shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator and shall be dependent upon the adequacy
of the data presented, completion of processing, and other legalities that may
be required if the subdivision involves rezoning, PAD, and/or other land use
exceptions.
      2.   As a prerequisite to the commission considering any preliminary plat
or PAD, a neighborhood meeting may be required to be conducted by the
applicant; if determined by the Zoning Administrator to be necessary. The
purpose of the meeting is to provide information to the adjacent property
owners and citizens. The applicant shall notify all landowners, adjoining or
adjacent to, the boundaries of the proposed development, the City of Eloy, and
any neighborhood associations on record with the City by first class mail no
less than fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled Planning and Zoning
Commission meeting. The applicant shall submit documentation of the attendees
and minutes of the meeting(s) to the City Community Development Department. All
meeting(s) shall be held within the City of Eloy corporate limits.
      3.   An applicant has ninety (90) days from the date of the DRC meeting,
or ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of later redlines, in which to
resubmit said plans. Failure to resubmit plans which address all of the DRC
comments, or subsequent redline comments, within ninety (90) days of the DRC
meeting or ninety (90) days from the receipt of later redlines shall cause the
application to be null and void and fees will not be refunded.
      4.   An applicant shall be required to submit a new preliminary plat
application, including fees and another review of the subdivision by the DRC if
the resubmittal is not in substantial conformance to the original application.
Substantial nonconformance is considered to be, but not limited to, the
following:
         a.   An increase in the number of lots or units in excess of ten
percent (10%).
         b.   A change in the size or configuration of the development parcel
in excess of ten percent (10%).
   B.   Preliminary Plat Review:
      1.   Zoning: The subdivision shall be designed to meet the specific
requirements for the zoning district within which it is located. However, in
the event that rezoning is necessary for the preliminary plat to conform with
the zoning district regulations, or if a PAD approval is sought, said action
shall be initiated concurrently with the preliminary plat by the property owner
or his authorized agent. In any event, any such zoning amendment required in
relation to the preliminary plat shall have been adopted prior to a preliminary
plat approval.
      2.   Planning: The subdivision shall be designed to comply with the
design principles of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the Eloy
General Plan. In the event that an amendment to the General Plan is necessary
for the preliminary plat to conform with the specific land use, circulation, or
open space elements, said amendment(s) required in relation to the preliminary
plat shall have been adopted prior to a preliminary plat approval.
      3.   Utilities And Services: As a prerequisite of preliminary plat
approval by the City, the subdivider shall have reviewed tentative concepts
with the Pinal County Health Department, the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality, the Arizona Department of Water Resources, Arizona
Public Service, Electrical District #2 or #4, Southwest Gas, CenturyLink, the
cable television/broadband company servicing the development for general
approval of the preliminary design to be used.
   C.   Preliminary Plat Approval:
      1.   When all requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, the case
will be scheduled for Planning and Zoning Commission consideration at their
regularly scheduled meeting. The Community Development Department report shall
be submitted for Planning and Zoning Commission review and action.
      2.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the preliminary
plat, DRC comments, and the Community Development Department report and
recommendations. If satisfied that all objectives have been met, the commission
may recommend approval of the preliminary plat to the City Council.
      3.   If the plat is generally acceptable, but requires minor revisions
before proceeding to the City Council for preliminary plat approval, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend conditional approval and the
required revisions noted in the minutes of the meeting and in the written
commission report submitted to the City Council.
      4.   If the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that all of the
objectives and requirements of this chapter have not been met, the commission
may recommend that the preliminary plat be continued pending revisions, or
recommend to the City Council denial of the preliminary plat. Resubmittals due
to revisions, for the same parcel or any part thereof, shall follow the
aforementioned procedure.
      5.   The City Council shall consider the preliminary plat, the commission
requirements and recommendations, and the Community Development Department
report and recommendations. If satisfied that all objectives and requirements
of this chapter have been met, the City Council may approve the preliminary
plat and make a notation of the City Council's approval on the copy of the
preliminary plat retained in the Office of the Zoning Administrator.
      6.   If the plat is generally acceptable, but requires minor revisions,
the City Council may conditionally approve the preliminary plat and the
required revisions noted in the minutes of the meeting. At the direction of the
City Council, the Zoning Administrator may approve the preliminary plat when it
has been satisfactorily revised in accordance with the stated conditions.
      7.   If all of the objectives and requirements of this chapter have not
been met, the City Council may deny the preliminary plat.
   D.   Significance Of Preliminary Plat Approval: Preliminary plat approval
constitutes authorization for the subdivider to proceed with preparation of the
final plat and the improvement plans and specifications for public
improvements. Preliminary plat approval is based on the following terms:
      1.   Subject To The Basic Approval: The basic conditions under which
preliminary approval of the preliminary plat is granted will not be
substantially changed prior to the expiration date.
      2.   Eighteen Months Approval: Approval of the preliminary plat is valid
for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of City Council approval.
      3.   Compliance: After approval of the preliminary plat by the City
Council, the sub-divider shall, within eighteen (18) months, cause a final plat
of the subdivision or any part thereof to be prepared in accordance with a
complete survey of the subdivision and in compliance with the approved
preliminary plat within the provisions of this chapter.
      4.   Submission Extension: Upon application by the sub-divider, the
Council may grant an extension for submission of the final plat of one year. In
the event the Council denies a sub-divider application for extension, the
decision shall be final.
      5.   Failure To Record Within Time Frame: If the sub-divider fails to
record a final plat for any phase of the preliminary plat within eighteen (18)
months, the preliminary plat approval will expire unless the sub-divider
applies for and receives an extension from the City Council.
      6.   Written Request For Extension: Any application of a sub- divider for
such extension of time for the recording of a final plat tract map shall be
made in writing to the Council not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to
the expiration of the time allowed.
      7.   No Authority To Record: Preliminary approval, in itself, does not
assure final acceptance of streets for dedication nor continuation of existing
zoning requirements for the development or its environs nor constitute
authorization to record the plat.
   E.   Appeals:
      1.   The decision of the Council to approve, approve with conditions or
deny the preliminary plat shall be final.
      2.   Whenever standards of subdivision design or subdivision improvement
standards are requested to be modified or altered, application shall be made in
writing on a form provided by the Community Development Department, stating
fully the reasons for the application and the facts relied upon by the sub-
divider. The City Council may, after receiving a recommendation from the
Community Development Director and Public Works Director, allow a modification
from the subdivision regulations, provided facts are presented to the
satisfaction of the Council, that the modifications will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity.
   F.   Preliminary Plat Required Re-Subdivision:
      1.   A preliminary plat showing data and information required by this
section shall be required when the re-subdivision of a lot, lots, tracts, or
parcels previously recorded as a subdivision or portion of a subdivision
results in three (3) or more additional lots, tracts or parcels.
   G.   Re-Filing Following Disapproval:
      1.   In the event that a preliminary plat is disapproved by the Council,
a new preliminary plat of the same area or portion thereof may only be filed,
within six (6) months of the date of disapproval, if the re-submittal is not in
substantial conformance with the original application. The applicant shall be
required to submit a new preliminary plat application, including fees and shall
adhere to the same review process. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)

The purpose of this article is to provide the development community with a
consistent set of standards to guide the physical development and the visual
quality of the community. The design standards in this article apply to all
development in the City. They focus on preservation and revitalization of many
aspects of the current rural/urban character of the City, while at the same
time encouraging new development that is dynamic, creative and imaginative.
(Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-2: GENERAL:
   A.   Every subdivision shall conform to the Eloy Zoning Ordinance, other
ordinances and regulations of the City, and the Arizona Revised Statutes, as
well as implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the Eloy General Plan.
In the event two (2) or more requirements conflict, the most restrictive
requirement shall apply.
   B.   All public improvements shown on the preliminary plat, and any
additional improvements that may be required by the City Council as a condition
for approval of the final plat, shall be the responsibility of the developer.
   C.   All improvements shall be accepted by the City Engineer prior to the
issuance of building permits for lots within the subdivision. Building permits
for model homes, sales office and construction site trailers may be allowed,
prior to the acceptance of the subdivision improvements by the City Engineer,
with a temporary use permit (TUP) through the Community Development Department.
   D.   Where the area proposed for development contains all or part of a park,
a school, flood control facility, or other public site, as shown on the General
Plan or as recommended by the City Council, such site shall either be dedicated
to the public or reserved for acquisition by the public or appropriate agency
within a specified period of time as prescribed in Arizona Revised Statutes 9-
463.01(D) and (E). An agreement shall be reached between the subdivider and the
appropriate public agency regarding time, method, and cost of such acquisition.
   E.   Land which is subject to periodic flooding, land which cannot be
properly drained, or land which is otherwise unsuitable for residential,
commercial, or industrial uses shall not be subdivided; except that the City
Council may approve the subdivision of such land upon receipt of evidence,
including subdivision construction assurances, satisfactory to the City
Engineer, City Attorney and Pinal County Floodplain Administrator that the
construction of specific improvements will render the land suitable. The
construction of subdivision improvements shall not commence until after final
plat approval and financial assurances have been secured to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer and City Attorney. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-3: SUBDIVISION SITE DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   General Site Design Requirements:
      1.   Density: Regardless of the density of the individual developments,
single-family residential subdivisions, and condominium or multi-family
subdivisions may be required to provide open space, provide buffering to
adjacent developments, provide landscaping, and provide physical connections to
adjacent neighborhoods and to the community open space network and trail
system.
      2.   Commercial And Industrial Subdivisions: Commercial and industrial
subdivisions shall be subject to all the requirements set forth in the Zoning
Ordinance and shall be designed according to the same principles governing the
design of residential developments; namely, buildings shall be located
according to topography; factors such as drainage, noise, odor, and surrounding
land uses considered in siting buildings; sufficient access shall be provided;
adverse impacts buffered; and open space, and landscaping provided. In
addition, the following standards shall apply to commercial and industrial
subdivisions:
         a.   Lots that back up to an existing or residentially designated land
shall be designed with extra depth, and a landscape buffer strip shall be
required.
         b.   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck
traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing
or potential residential areas.
         c.   The City Engineer and the City Council may impose special
requirements with respect to the design, construction and installation of the
public utilities, stormwater drainage, street, curb, gutter and sidewalk.
         d.   Street right-of-way and pavement design shall be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated by the
development.
      3.   Open Spaces And Trails: Those portions of the community open space
network and/or trail system adjacent to, or within, the area proposed for
development shall be incorporated by that development. Construction of these
open spaces and/or trails shall be the responsibility of the subdivider/
developer and shall be part of the subdivision improvements. These trails shall
be part of a "tract" and maintained by a homeowners/property owners'
association with the exception of the trails as specifically delineated in the
Eloy General Plan, which shall be dedicated to the public.
      4.   Variations Through PAD Process: The development, through the planned
area development (PAD) process as described in the Eloy Zoning Ordinance, upon
the requisite findings, may vary the minimum lot area, minimum setbacks, and
the maximum lot coverage from the standards specified in the zoning district
(s), in effect over the area considered for subdivision provided that such
variations are approved by the City Council prior to, or in conjunction with,
the preliminary plat approval for the subdivision.
      5.   Neighborhood (Subdivision) Entryways: In order to enhance the
appearance of subdivisions, developers are encouraged to provide landscaping,
identification signage and textured pavement at the entryways on at least one
major access point to the subdivision. Sight visibility triangles at entryways
and landscaping at entryways should be designed to visually enhance all arrival
points. Drought tolerant trees, shrubs, and ground covers should accent focal
points and enhance the streetscape.
      6.   Signage: Signage, when proposed, shall be attractively designed and
submitted along with the required landscape plans for approval. Signs shall be
integrated to complement the streetscape and landscaping frontages. Signage
shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
      7.   Textured Entryway Drives: Textured entryway drives (such as
decorative stone, stamped concrete or brick) may be incorporated into access
points from any collector or arterial street frontages.
   B.   Open Space Requirements:
      1.   If the subdivision is part of a planned area development (PAD),
which has been approved by the City, the open space requirements shall be in
accordance with the provisions of the approved PAD.
      2.   Open space area shall mean any area of land that can be enjoyed by
people. Open space could include landscaped or hardscaped plazas, any parking
area landscaping that exceeds that which is required by the Zoning Ordinance,
fountains, and sitting areas all meant to provide an open park like atmosphere.
Also, playgrounds, golf courses, bicycle trails (but not bike lanes within the
public right-of-way), pedestrian trails (not residential sidewalks integrated
with the curb), equestrian tracts and trailheads. Not more than fifty percent
(50%) of the required open space shall be attributed to golf course use or
ancillary golf uses. Open space does not include parking areas, retention/
detention basins that are concrete lined or non- landscaped, vacant or
undeveloped lots.
      3.   Open space intended to fulfill these open space requirements shall
be calculated upon the net acres of the subdivision whether residential,
commercial, or industrial. "Net acres" are defined as: total acres exclusive of
the area required for arterial or collector street right-of-way dedications and
school/public site dedications.
      4.   The open space areas shall be designed in such a manner as to be
easily accessible to all lots. "Accessible" means one-sixth (1/6) of a mile or
eight hundred eighty feet (880') between any one lot and an entrance area
allowing people, bikes or equestrians to enter into the open space area or view
the open space area.
      5.   Retention or detention basins, which are required in accordance with
the subdivision drainage report, shall not qualify as open space area unless
fifty percent (50%) or more of the usable area of the basin is above the 25-
year storm and designed to be used as an active multi-use area. The exception
to this standard is for commercial and industrial developments, which shall be
permitted to calculate the landscaped retention or detention area as part of
the required open space area.
      6.   Required open space for all types of subdivisions shall be as
prescribed in table 1 of this subsection or per the Council approved PAD;
whichever is greater.

   C.   Landscape And Streetscape Requirements:
      1.   Any lot, parcel, tract or development, or portion thereof, that is
adjacent to a City of Eloy, County or State right-of-way shall be required to
be landscaped. This "streetscape landscape area" shall consist of the
undeveloped portion of the right-of- way (back of sidewalk or pavement edge to
the right-of-way edge), in addition to the required front yard setback on site
landscaping that is required by this section.
      2.   For any lot, parcel, property or tract that abuts or is adjacent to
the Interstate 10 right-of-way or the State Route 87 and State Route 287
rights-of-way, the landscape plan and plant palette shall adhere to the
"Landscape Design Guidelines for Urban Highways" prepared for roadside
development services by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), or as
may be amended, and shall be approved by ADOT and the City of Eloy. Maintenance
agreements for the landscaping within the interstate highway right-of-way shall
be required and shall be subject to ADOT and City approvals.
      3.   A landscape area shall be established, per the following table,
between the right-of-way line and any buildings, parking lots, walls or fences,

required landscape materials shall be computed for all streetscape landscape
areas as follows:
         a.   Trees: A minimum of one tree shall be required per one thousand
(1,000) square feet of landscape area and a maximum of one tree shall be
required per seven hundred fifty (750) square feet of landscape area, depending
on area configuration, orientation and use. All trees shall be twenty four
inches (24") box. Calculations that result in a fraction shall be rounded up.
         b.   Shrubs: One shrub shall also be required per two hundred fifty
(250) square feet of landscape area. All shrubs shall be a minimum of five (5)
gallons in size.
         c.   Groundcover: All groundcover shall be a minimum of one gallon in
size. One groundcover plant shall be provided per two hundred fifty (250)
square feet of landscape area.
         d.   Landscape Topping Materials: All landscaped areas shall be
finished with a natural inert topping material which may include, but is not
limited to, decomposed granite (2 inches minimum depth). Type, size and color
of landscape topping material for projects shall be approved through the
landscape plan review process.
         e.   Placement Of Required Streetscape Landscaping:
         (1) Vegetation shall not be planted in drainage ways.
         (2) Trees may not be planted where they will interfere with any
overhead or underground utility lines in their initial planted or mature height
or width.
         (3) Trees are not to be planted in any sight visibility triangle.
Shrubs to be planted in any sight visibility triangle shall be of varieties
that do not exceed mature heights of more than twenty four inches (24"), as
measured from finished grade.
         (4) Trees and/or shrubs shall not be planted closer than three feet
(3') to any fire hydrant or utility transformer/pole.
         (5) Trees shall not be planted closer than five feet (5'), as measured

drip or soaker irrigation system.
      4.   Weed Prevention: A pre-emergent herbicide shall be applied to the
ground prior to and after the placement of natural surface materials
(decomposed granite, river run rock, and the like) in any landscaped area to
prevent weed growth.
      5.   Landscape Design Compatibility: Landscape designs shall be
compatible among adjacent and proximate properties.
      6.   Water Retention Areas: All on-site water retention areas shall be
entirely landscaped and shall comply with the following criteria:
         a.   The retention areas shall not occupy more than fifty percent
(50%) of the on-site street frontage landscape area;
         b.   All retention areas shall maintain slopes no steeper than 6:
1 when adjacent to public rights-of-way, or when there is pedestrian type
access to that portion of the basin. Side slopes adjacent to walls, fences,
hedges and the like (i.e., no or limited pedestrian type access in that area)
may have side slopes up to 4:1.
   E.   Access Requirements:
      1.   Every subdivision (residential, commercial and industrial) shall
have two (2) access points.
      2.   Rural and estate type developments shall front onto and take access
from streets classified as arterial or collector streets as set forth in the
circulation element of the Eloy general plan.

Eloy street standards.
      4.   Every lot shall have frontage onto a fully improved, publicly
dedicated and accepted right-of-way (street or alleyway) that meets all City of
Eloy street standards. Private streets that meet City of Eloy street standards
may provide frontage to lots if the development is approved through the planned
area development (PAD) process.
   F.   Multi-Use Pathways And Trail Requirements:
      1.   New development shall incorporate, at a minimum, and where
appropriate, multi-use pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths as an integral
component of the required open space of the development. These multi-use
pathways must be located and designed to assure complete separation from
vehicular traffic and be wide enough to accommodate two-way pedestrian and
bicycle movement. Pathways shall have a minimum separation of five feet (5')
from the back of curb to where the path is when adjacent to and parallel with a
street.
      2.   New development that proposes parcels or lots in excess of two and
one-half (21/2) acres in size should accommodate equestrian uses in conjunction
with the required multi-use pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths, or as a
separate trail.
      3.   Developers are urged to take into account actual or probable paths
and routes that pedestrians, bicycle riders and equestrians may take for
circulation, access to schools, parks, playgrounds, shopping, entertainment and
other key community destinations. Particular care should be given to linkages
with adjacent subdivisions to promote internal pedestrian, bicycle and
equestrian traffic without crossing arterial or collector streets as much as
possible.
      4.   Pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails within and through a
development should connect to, and be a part of, the linear park and open space
system of the community. These paths and trails should be landscaped and
minimally furnished to provide shade and rest areas in order to encourage their
extensive use as a secondary mode of transportation and access throughout the
neighborhoods and the City.
      5.   Pedestrian and bicycle pathways shall have a total right-of- way or
easement width of fifteen feet (15') to accommodate landscaping and furnishings
as well as an eight foot (8') wide hard surface of asphalt concrete or similar
material. If the multi-use pathways include an equestrian trail, the total
right- of-way or easement width shall be twenty seven feet (27'), with the
additional twelve foot (12') portion devoted to equestrians constructed of a
softer surface treatment consisting of finely ground gravel or other compatible
dense, yet soft material.

accordance with the approved landscape plan, except in and along public rights-
of-way and easements where the City of Eloy has agreed to provide maintenance.
   H.   The replacement of dead street trees shall be by the individual
property owners or the homeowners' association and shall be completed within
thirty (30) days from the date that the association or property owner is
notified by the City. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-5: SPECIFIC LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS FOR ON SITE SINGLE RESIDENTIAL LOTS:

vegetative and inert ground cover to prevent soil erosion and headcutting. All
landscape areas adjacent to the vehicular parking and access areas shall be
protected by a permanent vertical curb or concrete wheel stop in order to
minimize landscape damage by vehicular traffic. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-8: WALL/FENCING REQUIREMENTS:
In order to enhance the appearance of the community, neighborhoods rather than
individual subdivisions are desired. Walled in, separated subdivisions do not
create neighborhoods by themselves and are strongly discouraged.
   A.   Single And Multiple Residential Standards:
      1.   The use of solid view obscuring perimeter walls along the boundary
of the subdivision is not permitted except where specifically indicated on the
final plat and approved by the City Council. Perimeter walls adjacent to the
community open space system shall be view fences. External orientation of the
subdivision to the surrounding arterial, collector and local streets as well as
adjacent residential development is strongly encouraged and should limit the
need for solid view obscuring perimeter walls.
      2.   Openings in the perimeter view fence are encouraged at the end of
abutting interior cul-de-sac streets and along the community trail system, if
applicable, to provide the desired connectivity to the community.
      3.   Vegetative screening is encouraged, in lieu of walls or fencing,
when a residential subdivision is adjacent to a commercial development.
Allowances for a solid wall may be made if the commercial use is required to
have a wall or fence by national or State standards or if the residential area
would be adjacent to the outdoor storage or loading area of an existing
commercial use.
      4.   A solid wall may be required when a residential subdivision is
adjacent to an existing industrial development or land zoned for future
industrial use.
      5.   In the cases where a solid wall is used solely, or in combination
with view fencing, the solid portion shall be decoratively treated on all sides
to match the residential product architectural style and design.
      6.   Wire mesh or chain link, no higher than the top rail, may be used
when in conjunction with a pipe rail or corral style fencing but not as a
stand-alone fencing material. The use of slat filled chain link fences shall be
prohibited.

   B.   Commercial And Industrial Standards:
      1.   When solid view obscuring perimeter walls are necessary or required
they shall be decoratively finished on all sides to match the commercial and/or
industrial product architectural style and design.
      2.   Where a commercial or industrial development share a common property
line with a Residentially zoned property (including agricultural lands) or the
community open space areas a solid perimeter wall shall not enclose the
required landscaped buffer area. Rather the perimeter wall shall be a view
fence and any necessary view obscuring screen walls shall be set back from the
property line a minimum of forty feet (40') or behind the buffer area whichever
is greater.
      3.   Trash and refuse collection locations shall be screened with a six
foot (6') decorative masonry wall. Trash and refuse areas shall be located such
that they are not the visual focal point of a driveway or parking area, or
cannot be viewed from a public street.
      4.   Outside storage areas, transformers, generators, heavy mechanical
equipment and other similar eyesores shall be screened from the public street
view and adjacent residential, office, and commercial uses to a height of at
least six feet (6'). Materials shall not be stacked, piled, or stored in such a
manner as to project above the screen wall.
      5.   Parking areas adjacent to the required front yard shall provide a
decorative screen wall or landscape berm or combination thereof to a height not
to exceed three feet (3') in order to adequately screen the undercarriages of
the parked vehicles.
      6.   Access Requirements:
         a.   Every subdivision (residential, commercial and industrial) shall
have two (2) access points.
         b.   Rural and estate type developments shall front onto and take
access from streets classified as arterial or collector streets as set forth in
the circulation element of the Eloy general plan.
         c.   All residential developments shall front onto and take access
from public, or approved private streets, classified as and developed to the
city of Eloy street standards. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-9: ARCHITECTURAL/PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General: All subdivisions that intend to use home product "standard
plans", rather than each lot developing as a custom home design, shall submit
all proposed standard plans to the City for approval after the final plat has
been approved and prior to any building permits being issued. Deviations from
the approved standard plans (e.g., exterior materials and details, floor plans,
square footage, etc.) shall require review and re-approval by the City.
   B.   Rural And Estate Residential: Open space and vegetation dominate;
architectural and manmade elements are apparent, but secondary. Rural uses,
such as horses and view fencing, hedgerows along property boundaries, and
generous setbacks from the street will visually contribute to the rural and
estate character.
      1.   Mechanical equipment, electrical meter and service components,
propane tanks, coolers, water filters and similar utility equipment shall be
installed at ground level or wall mounted and shall be screened from public
view and designed to appear as an integral part of the building.
      2.   Detached garages and side entry garages are encouraged and shall
architecturally match the residential structure. The garage area shall not
comprise more than thirty five percent (35%) of the total front elevation as
visible from the front yard. Attached garages, facing the front yard and
street, should have a facade that is recessed a minimum of seven feet (7') from
the forward most living space, exclusive of a porch or courtyard, to provide
interest and relief from the street.
      3.   The front elevation should prominently feature a pedestrian scaled
entry or porch. The rear and side elevations should be aesthetically enhanced
and of an architectural character comparable with the front elevation.
      4.   Embellish window treatments on all homes by adding architectural
features which enhance the elevations, e.g., gabled roof features over windows,
structural pop-outs, recesses, different window styles, etc.
      5.   Accessory buildings and/or farm buildings should be maintained in a
structurally sound condition and should complement the architecture of the
primary structure.
   C.   Single-Family Residential, R1-12 And R1-6: Architecture and the manmade
elements are the predominant features. Setbacks for, and between, buildings are
reduced proportionately to the size of the lots. Front yards may be reduced and
street presence become more predominant for porches if the garage/auto area is
proportionately recessed from the street or detached with access from a rear
alley. Sufficient open space must be provided between or within adjacent
subdivision developments for effective contrast and balance to the buildings
and the land.
      1.   Mechanical equipment, electrical meter and service components,
propane tanks, coolers, water filters and similar utility equipment shall be
installed at ground level or wall mounted and shall be screened from public
view and designed to appear as an integral part of the building.
      2.   The entryway of the dwellings, rather than the garages, should have
a strong relationship to the neighborhood street (public realm). Detached
garages are encouraged and should architecturally match the residential
structure.
      3.   The garage area shall not comprise more than forty five percent
(45%) of the total front elevation as visible from the front yard. Attached
garages shall have a recessed facade and door when facing the front yard and
street, with the recess varying a minimum of three feet (3') to seven feet (7')
from the forward most living space, exclusive of a porch or courtyard. One plan
per product line may have a garage that extends in front of the living space of
the dwelling.
      4.   Several driveway approaches shall be incorporated into a tract home
subdivision, e.g., side entry garage, detached garages, in- line garages and
alley frontage garages, etc. At least one standard plan offered shall include a
detached garage design. At least one standard plan offered shall include a side
entry garage as a standard feature.

      5.   The front elevation should prominently feature a pedestrian scaled
entry or porch. The rear and side elevations should be aesthetically enhanced
and of an architectural character comparable with the front elevation.
      6.   Overhanging eaves, and front facing covered porches are strongly
encouraged.
      7.   Roof material shall not be wood shake shingles. Open gable roofs,
emphasizing the lack of detail, should be avoided.
      8.   Straight rooflines should be varied by using offsets, differing
heights, stepping, or different orientations to produce more variety within a
development.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/97c78706155ec6aefd4314531fd743f0812a5245/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2433.jpg] 
      9.   Embellish window treatments on all homes by adding architectural
features, which enhance the elevations, e.g., gabled roof features over
windows, structural popouts, recesses, headers, tile inlays, different window
designs and styles, etc. Such features must be added to all of the exterior
elevations of the structures to provide interest and relief.
      10.   The building materials of a project shall be durable, require low
maintenance, and be of the same or higher quality as surrounding developments.
The use of "T1-11 siding" (rough sawn plywood siding with vertical grooves at 4
inches or 8 inches OC) shall be prohibited. All residential buildings shall
have a permanent foundation and a garage or carport structure.
      11.   Repetitious elevations shall be avoided. The same elevations shall
not be utilized across from or adjacent to each other. Repetitive use of
standard plans shall be avoided. A minimum of four (4) floor plans, with at
least three (3) distinctly different elevations for each floor plan, shall be
required for all tract home subdivisions. Additionally, a minimum of three (3)
colors of roof material, three (3) styles of garage doors and three (3)
exterior paint colors shall be required to further promote visual interest and
architectural diversity. A variety of building details, form, massing,
material, proportion, and sighting shall be used to promote well-proportioned
four (4) sided architecture.
      12.   A walkway from the street to the front porch or entry is strongly
encouraged.
   D.   Small Lot And Multiple-Family Residential:
      1.   Mechanical equipment, electrical meter and service components,
propane tanks, coolers, water filters and similar utility equipment shall be
installed at ground level or wall mounted and shall be screened from public
view and designed to appear as an integral part of the building.
      2.   Roof material shall not be wood shake shingles. Open gable roofs,
emphasizing the lack of detail, should be avoided. Overhanging eaves that help
shade the building and create interest and relief are strongly encouraged.
      3.   Straight rooflines should be varied by using offsets, differing
heights, stepping, or different orientations to produce more variety within a
development.
      4.   The front elevation should prominently feature pedestrian scaled
entryways that are easily identifiable. The rear and side elevations should be
aesthetically enhanced and of an architectural character comparable with the
front elevation.
      5.   All of the exterior elevations of the structures shall provide
interest and relief. Embellish window treatments on buildings by adding
architectural features which enhance the elevations, e.g., gabled roof features
over windows, structural pop outs, recesses, headers, tile inlays, different
window designs and styles, etc.
      6.   All of the dwellings units within the development should have a
strong relationship to one another, to the common open space and to the
neighborhood street. A walkway from the street to the front entry is strongly
encouraged.
      7.   The building materials of a project shall be durable, require low
maintenance, and be of the same or higher quality as surrounding developments.
The use of "T1-11 siding" (rough sawn plywood siding with vertical grooves at 4
inches or 8 inches OC) shall be prohibited. All multiple residential buildings
shall have a permanent foundation and a garage or carport structure.
   E.   Commercial, Mixed-Use, Business And Industrial Development:
Architecture and the manmade elements is the predominant feature and thus must
be sited and designed in a manner that will benefit the community, improve the
physical appearance, contribute to the small-town character and be pedestrian
friendly.
      1.   Mechanical equipment, electrical meter and service components,
electrical transformers, backflow prevention devices, large water standpipes,
propane tanks, telephone boxes, chilling units, and any other obtrusively large
electrical, mechanical or similar utility device or equipment, whether ground
level, wall mounted, or roof mounted, shall be fully screened from public view
and designed to appear as an integral part of the building.
      2.   The building materials of a project shall be durable, require low
maintenance, and be of a substantial quality.
      3.   All building elevations, which face a public street or are adjacent
to residential uses or zoning districts, shall have an architectural design
other than metal or corrugated metal.
      4.   All buildings shall incorporate three hundred sixty degree (360°)
architecture, a variety of massing and building heights, and stepping
rooflines. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-10: STREET LOCATION AND ARRANGEMENT:
   A.   The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and
orderly movement of traffic and pedestrians; meet, but not exceed, the needs of
present and future population served; have a simple and logical pattern;
respect natural features and topography; and, present an attractive
streetscape.
   B.   In residential subdivisions, the road system shall be designed to serve
the needs of the greater neighborhood. Vehicular through traffic should be
discouraged using traffic calming methods such as decorative raised paving,
traffic circles, landscaped diverters, traffic chokers and other landscaping
devices.
   C.   There shall be no development of roadways built to arterial or
collector standards unless that roadway and roadway alignment is shown in the
Circulation Element of the Eloy General Plan as a proposed roadway.
   D.   Whenever a proposed subdivision embraces any part of an arterial or
collector street designated in the general plan, such street shall be platted
in conformity therein. Street layout shall provide for the continuation of such
arterial and collector streets as the general plan or City Engineer may
designate.
   E.   Certain proposed streets, as designated by the City, shall be extended
to the subdivision boundary to provide future connection with adjoining
unsubdivided lands.
   F.   All "local streets" shall be designed with curb separated sidewalks to
meet the safety needs of the pedestrians and to enhance the streetscape.
   G.   Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography as to
produce desirable lots of maximum utility, streets of reasonable gradient, and
the facilitation of adequate drainage.
   H.   Where private streets are approved through the PAD process, such
streets shall be constructed to City public street specifications and shall be
placed into specific "street tracts" of land. Statements shall be contained on
the plat and in both the deed restrictions and the homeowners' or property
owners' association bylaws that those streets are declared private subject to
an easement authorizing use by emergency and public service vehicles, and
remain the permanent responsibility of the homeowners' or property owners'
association. If at any time the streets are dedicated to, and accepted by, the
City, the streets must first be developed to standards specified by the City at
the time of dedication.
   I.   If approved by the City Council, low density and medium density
residential subdivisions designed in a neo-traditional manner may designate an
alley as the primary means for access. Alleys may be required in commercial and
industrial subdivisions as approved by the City Council. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-
2018)
15-4-11: STREET DESIGN:
See exhibits 4 through 9 at the end of this section.
   A.   Design Of Streets: The design of streets shall conform to standards
established by the MAG Uniform Standard Specifications and Details for Public
Works Construction and by this chapter. See exhibit 4 through exhibit 9 at the
end of this section for specifics.
   B.   Private Streets: Private streets shall conform to above stated design
standards unless otherwise approved by the City Council. Private streets shall
be placed within their own parcel or tract of land and shall only be approved
through a PAD. Where site conditions necessitate unique design solutions,
modifications may be approved by the City Council.
   C.   Cul-De-Sac Streets: Cul-de-sac streets shall be constructed as shown in
exhibit 9 of this section. The City Engineer may recommend an equally
convenient form of turning and backing areas where extreme conditions justify.
The maximum length of cul-de- sac streets shall be six hundred feet (600') or
twenty (20) homes as measured from the intersection of right-of-way lines to
the extreme depth of the turning circle along the street centerline. An
exception may be made where topography justifies but shall not be made merely
because the tract has restrictive boundary dimensions, wherein provision should
be made for extension of the street pattern to the adjoining unplatted parcel
and a temporary turnaround installed.
   D.   Dead End Streets: Dead end streets will not be approved except in
locations recommended by the City Engineer as necessary to future development
of adjacent lands.
   E.   Private Access And Driveways: Access from private property to any
dedicated street shall be constructed in accordance with permits issued by the
City. Width of driveway at the property line shall be a minimum of twelve feet
(12') and a maximum of forty feet (40'). The width will depend on the access to
be served (e.g., residential, commercial or industrial). All residential access
treatment within the right-of-way will be constructed with five inches (5") of
concrete or two inches (2") of asphalt over a five inch (5") aggregate base.
   F.   Alleys: Alleys shall be designed with a minimum of twenty four feet
(24') of pavement when there is residential property on both sides and thirty
feet (30') when abutting commercial or industrial properties. Dead end and
"half" alleys shall be prohibited.
   G.   Street Intersections:
      1.   Streets intersecting a major street shall do so at a ninety degree
(90°) angle; intersection of local streets shall not vary from ninety degrees
(90°) by more than fifteen degrees (15°). The City Engineer, based on terrain
and other conditions, will consider exceptions to these requirements.
      2.   Street jogs with centerline offsets less than one hundred thirty
five feet (135') shall be prohibited, except when approved by the City
Engineer. Under special circumstances where local streets intersect major
streets, the City Engineer may require minimum centerline offsets of four
hundred feet (400').
      3.   Local streets intersecting a collector street or arterial street
shall have a tangent section of centerline at least one hundred fifty feet
(150') in length measured from the right-of- way line of the major street,
except that no such tangent is required when local street curve has a
centerline radius greater than four hundred feet (400') with the center located
on the major street right-of-way line. Where topographic conditions make
necessary other treatment to secure the best overall design, these standards
may be varied by the City Council upon the recommendation of the City Engineer.
      4.   Street intersections with more than four (4) legs and Y-type
intersections where legs meet at acute angles shall be prohibited.
      5.   At local intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by
circular arc, having a minimum radius of twenty feet (20'). A thirty three foot
(33') by thirty three foot (33') triangle shall be provided at each corner of
the intersection of two (2) major streets. Under special conditions the City
Engineer may recommend other dimensions for the above.
   H.   Surface Treatment: The traveled way of all streets shall be surfaced
with asphalt concrete. The placing of asphalt concrete shall be accomplished
under generally accepted construction techniques provided in section 321 of the
MAG standard.
   I.   Structural Section: The thickness of base and surface treatment for all
streets shall be based on geotechnical analysis and pavement thickness design
provided by the developer. In no case will the base be less than eight inches
(8") and the surface treatment less than three inches (3") (compacted
thickness).
   J.   Aggregate Base Course: All developments will be required to submit a
geotechnical report and pavement recommendation prepared by an Arizona
registered geotechnical engineer. The pavement report will recommend at least
two (2) alternative structural sections for each street classification.
Additional asphalt may be substituted for untreated base at the ratio of one
inch (1") to three inches (3") (1:3). The top four inches (4") must be ABC, the
balance may be ABC or select material.

15-4-12: LOT PLANNING:
   A.   Lot width, depth and area shall comply with the minimum requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance; however, where drainage or flooding problems exist or
prevail, the City may require special lot width, depth and/or area exceeding
minimum requirements of the zoning district.
   B.   Depth to width ratio of the usable area of a single residence lot shall
usually not be greater than three to one (3:1).
   C.   All proposed lots must be developable without the need of a variance,
waiver or further discretionary approvals from the City. Prior to final plat
approval, the City may require additional documentation, including, but not
limited to, engineered concept plans, for lots with questionable
developability.
   D.   Corner lots shall generally be designed larger to accommodate the
increased setback requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
   E.   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines, except where other treatment may be justified in the opinion of
the City Engineer.
   F.   Residential lots extending through the block and having frontage on two
(2) parallel streets which are both local streets, or one of which is a local
street and the other is a collector street, shall not be permitted; except when
there are Commercial or Industrial Zoning Districts on the opposite side of the
street and except where justified in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-13: EASEMENT PLANNING:
   A.   Easements will be required for all private utilities outside of the
street right-of-way and shall be placed along lot lines as required by the
City/utility companies.
   B.   Where a stream, wash or important surface drainage course abuts or
crosses a development, dedication of a drainage easement of a width sufficient
to permit widening, deepening, relocating, or protecting and maintaining said
watercourse shall be required. All drainage easement widths shall be approved
by the City Engineer and the Pinal County Flood Control District based upon the
hydrological analysis of a 100-year frequency storm.
   C.   All retention and detention areas shall be in tracts with drainage
easements.
   D.   It shall be the responsibility of each public utility company to review
preliminary plats and indicate on them the easements necessary to serve the
proposed development. It is also the public utility company's responsibility to
review final plats to ensure that all requested easements have been included.
   E.   Land within a drainageway or within an easement for major power
transmission (tower) lines or pipelines shall not be considered a part of the
useable lot area.
   F.   Lots arranged to back to arterial streets, railroads, or Commercial or
Industrial Districts shall have a recorded one foot (1') nonvehicular access
easement along the rear lot line. (Ord. 18-879, 7-23-2018)
15-4-14: STREET NAMING:
   A.   Street names should be consistent with the natural alignment and
extension of existing named streets. New street names shall be sufficiently
different in sound and spelling from other street names in the City so as to
not cause confusion.
   B.   The developer shall propose a list of street names to be reviewed and

District: In calculating and imposing a development fee applicable to land in a
community facilities district established under Arizona Revised Statutes title
48, chapter 4, article 6, the city shall take into account all public
infrastructure provided by the district and capital costs paid by the district
for necessary public services and facilities and shall not assess a portion of
the development fee otherwise calculated to be due that would duplicate the
infrastructure provided by the district or the costs imposed by the district on
new development.
   D.   Exceptions: Except as otherwise provided herein, this article shall
apply to all new development within any service area, except for the
development of any public school, private school, or city facility.
   E.   Applicable Territory: The provisions of this article shall apply to all
of the territory within the corporate limits of the city and/or within the
city's water and wastewater service areas.
   F.   Determinations: The city manager or his/her designee is authorized to
make determinations regarding the application, administration and enforcement
of the provisions of this article. (Ord. 12-806, 1-9-2012)
16A-4: IMPOSITION, CALCULATION AND COLLECTION OF FEES:
   A.   In General: The city shall calculate, through the issuance of a
development fee calculation form, the development fees at the time of the
issuance of a building permit. The applicant shall pay the development fees
prior to the issuance of a building permit. The city actions established in
this section are to be performed by the planning and development director, or
his designee, unless specifically stated otherwise.
   B.   Calculation:
      1.   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the city shall
determine: a) whether it is a residential or nonresidential use; b) the
specific category (type) of residential or nonresidential development, if
applicable; c) if residential, the number of new dwelling units; and d) if
nonresidential, the number of new or additional square feet of gross floor area
(rounded up to the nearest square foot) and the proposed use.
      2.   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the city shall
determine whether it is for a change in use. In such cases, the development fee
due shall be based only on the incremental increase in the development fee(s)
for the additional public facilities needed for the change in use.
      3.   After making these determinations, the city shall calculate the
demand for the necessary public services and facilities added by the new
development for each public facility category for which a development fee is
being imposed and calculate the applicable development fee by multiplying the
demand added by the new development by the amount of the applicable development
fee per unit of development, incorporating any applicable offset if set forth
in the particular development fee calculation methodology.
      4.   If the type of land use proposed for new development is not
expressly listed in the particular development fee ordinance and schedule, the
city shall, at its option, determine the basis used to calculate the
development fee(s) by:
         a.   Identifying the most similar land use type listed and calculate
the development fee based on the development fee for that land use; or
         b.   Identifying the broader land use category within which the
specified land use would apply and calculate the development fee based on the
development fee for that land use category; or
         c.   Reference to an independent impact analysis for development fee
calculation. If this option is chosen, the following shall apply:
(1) The applicant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for preparing the
independent impact analysis, which shall be reviewed for approval by the
planning and development director, the city engineer, and the city manager
prior to the planning and development director's notification pursuant to
subsection B4c(3) of this section.
(2) The independent impact analysis shall measure the impact that the proposed
new development will have on the particular public facility at issue, and shall
be based on the same methodologies used in the development fee calculation
methodology report, and shall be supported by professionally acceptable data
and assumptions.
(3) After review of the independent impact analysis submitted by the applicant,
the planning and development director shall accept or reject the analysis and
provide written notice to the applicant of its decision on a form provided for
such purpose within thirty (30) days of the submission of the completed
independent impact analysis. If the independent impact analysis is rejected,
the written notice shall provide an explanation of the insufficiencies of the
analysis.
(4) The final decision of the planning director may be appealed pursuant to
subsection F of this section.
      5.   An applicant may request a nonbinding estimate of development fees
due for a particular new development at any time by filing a request on a form
provided for such purpose by the planning and development department; provided,
however, that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal application
for a building permit for new development is made. Such nonbinding estimate is
solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant and shall in no way bind
the city nor preclude it from making amendments or revisions to any provisions
of this article, the specific development fee implementing ordinances or the
development fee schedules.
      6.   The calculation of development fees due from a multiple use new
development shall be based upon the aggregated demand for each public facility
generated by each land use type in the new development.
      7.   The calculation of development fees due from a phased new
development shall be based upon the demand generated by each specific land use
within the phase of development for which a separate building permit is
requested.
      8.   Development fees shall be calculated based on the development fee
amount in effect at the time of application for a building permit.
   C.   Offsets: The city manager, or his designee, shall perform the actions
of the city in accordance with this subsection unless specifically stated
otherwise.
      1.   Offsets against the amount of a development fee due from a new
development shall be provided for, among other things, contributions made in
cash, or by dedication of land or by actual construction of all or part of a
public facility by the affected property owner for public facilities meeting or
exceeding the demand generated by the new development, and the contribution is
determined by the city to be a reasonable substitute for the cost of public
facilities which are included in the particular development fee calculation
methodology.
      2.   The amount of the excess contribution shall be determined by the
city upon its receipt of an application form requesting an offset; provided,
however, that: a) the city will make no reimbursement for excess contributions
unless and until the particular public facility fund has sufficient revenue to
make the reimbursement without jeopardizing the continuity of the city's
capital improvements program; and b) the excess contribution may not be
transferred or credited to any other type of development fees calculated to be
due from that development for other types of public facilities. The
determination of the eligibility for and the amount of the credit shall be made
by the city on a form provided for such purposes. If the applicant contends
that any aspect of the city's decision constitutes an abuse of discretion, the
applicant shall be entitled to appeal pursuant to subsection F of this section.
      3.   No offset shall be allowed unless the city has approved the
contribution or expenditure before it is or was made.
      4.   Offsets for dedication of land or provision of necessary public
services or facilities shall be applicable only as to development fees imposed
for the same types of public facilities which are proposed to be dedicated or
provided. Even if the value of the dedication of land or provision of a public
facility exceeds the development fee due for the type of public facility, the
excess value may not be transferred to development fees calculated to be due
from the applicant for other types of public facilities for which development
fees may be imposed. Offsets may, however, be transferred to the same applicant
or to other applicants for new development which is proposed within the final
approved platted area of the same development and for the same type of public
facility.
   D.   Collection:
      1.   The city shall collect all applicable development fees at the time
of issuance of a building permit and shall issue a receipt to the applicant for
such payment unless:
         a.   The applicant is determined to be entitled to a full offset; or
         b.   The applicant has been determined to be not subject to the
payment of a development fee; or
         c.   The applicant has filed an appeal and a bond or other surety in
the amount of the development fee, as calculated by the city and approved by
the city attorney and finance director, has been posted with the city.
      2.   The city shall collect a development fee at the time of issuance of
a building permit even if development fees were paid by the applicant at an
earlier time in the development permit or approval process if the amount of the
development fees has increased since such prior approval. The applicant shall
only be liable for the difference between the development fees paid earlier and
those in effect at the time of issuance of the subsequent building permit.
   E.   Accounts, Funds And Refunds:
      1.   Development Fee Accounts: A development fee account shall be
established by the city for each category of necessary public services or
facilities for which development fees are imposed. Such account shall clearly
identify the category, account, or fund for which the development fee has been
imposed. All development fees collected by the city shall be deposited into the
appropriate development fee account or subaccount, which shall be interest
bearing. All interest earned on monies deposited to such account shall be
credited to and shall be considered funds of the account. The funds of each
such account shall be capable of being accounted for separately from all other
city funds, over time. The city shall establish and implement necessary
accounting controls to ensure that the development fee funds are properly
deposited, accounted for and appropriated in accordance with this article,
Arizona Revised Statutes section 9-463.05 and any other applicable legal
requirements.
      2.   Appropriation Of Development Fee Funds:
         a.   In General: Development fee funds may be appropriated for
necessary public services or facilities, for "public facility expenditures" as
defined in section
16A-1 of this article and for the payment of principal, interest and other
financing costs on contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on
behalf of the city or other applicable local governmental entities to finance
such necessary public services and public facility expenditures. All
appropriations from development fee accounts shall be detailed on a form
provided for such purposes and filed with the finance department.
         b.   Restrictions On Appropriations: Development fees shall be
appropriated only: 1) for the particular public facility for which they were
imposed, calculated and collected; and 2) within ten (10) years of the
beginning of the fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of collection,
unless such time period is extended as provided herein. Development fees shall
not be appropriated for funding maintenance or repair of public facilities nor
for operational or personnel expenses associated with the provision of the
public facility.
         c.   Appropriation Of Development Fee Funds Beyond Ten Years Of
Collection: Notwithstanding subsection E2b of this section, development fee
funds may be appropriated beyond ten (10) years from the beginning of the
fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of collection if the appropriation
is for necessary public services or facilities which require more than ten (10)
years to plan, design and construct, and the demand for the necessary public
services or facilities is generated in whole or in part by the new development,
or if the necessary public services or facilities will actually serve the new
development. Such appropriations shall be documented by the city.
      3.   Procedure For Appropriation Of Development Fee Funds:
         a.   The city shall each year identify necessary public services or
facilities projects anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with
development fees. The necessary public services or facilities recommendations
shall be based upon the development fee annual review set forth in subsection
16A-3B of this article and such other information as may be relevant, and may
be part of the city's annual budget and capital improvements programming
process.
         b.   The recommendations shall be consistent with the provisions of
this article, the particular public facility development fee ordinances,
Arizona Revised Statutes section 9-463.05, or other applicable legal
requirements and any guidelines adopted by the mayor and council.
         c.   The mayor and council may include development fee funded
necessary public services or facilities in the city's annual budget and capital
improvements program. If included, the description of the public facility shall
specify the nature of the facility, the location of the public facility, the
capacity to be added by the public facility, the service area of the public
facility, the need/demand for the public facility and the anticipated timing of
completion of the public facility.
         d.   The mayor and council may authorize development fee funded
necessary public services or facilities at such other times as may be deemed
necessary and appropriate by a majority vote of the council.
         e.   The mayor and council shall verify that adequate development fee
funds are or will be available from the appropriate development fee account for
the particular necessary public service or facility.
      4.   Refunds:
         a.   Eligibility For Refund:
         (1) Expiration Or Revocation Of Building Permit: An applicant who has
paid a development fee for a new development for which the necessary building
permit has expired or for which the building permit has been revoked prior to
construction shall be eligible to apply for a refund of development fees paid
on a form provided by the city for such purposes.
         (2) Failure Of City To Appropriate Development Fee Funds Within Time
Limit: The current property owner may apply for a refund of development fees
paid by an applicant if the city has failed to appropriate the development fees
collected from the applicant within the time limit established in subsections
E2b and E2c of this section. The refund application shall be made on a form
provided by the city for such purposes.
         (3) Abandonment Of Development After Initiation Of Construction: An
applicant who has paid a development fee for a new development for which a
building permit has been issued and pursuant to which construction has been
initiated, but which construction is abandoned prior to completion and issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, shall not be eligible for a refund unless the
uncompleted building is completely demolished.
         (4) Administrative Fee: A five percent (5%) administrative fee, but
not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00), shall be deducted from the amount
of any refund granted and shall be retained by the city in the appropriate
development fee account to defray the administrative expenses associated with
the processing of a refund application.
         (5) Refund: Refunds shall be made only to the current owner of
property on which the new development was proposed or occurred. If more than
one owner owns property which paid the development fees, the request for
refunds shall contain a copy of the conveyance documents wherein the
proportionate ownership shares are set forth and the refunds shall be issued in
accordance with the ownership shares of the conveyance documents.
         b.   Processing Of Application For Refund: Application for a refund
shall be made on a form provided by the city for such purposes and shall
include all information required in this subsection E4, as appropriate. Upon
receipt of a complete application for a refund, the city shall review the

property owner; 2) the amount of the development fees paid by public facilities
category and receipts evidencing such payments; and 3) documentation evidencing
the expiration or revocation of the building permit or approval of demolition
of the structure pursuant to a valid city issued demolition permit. Failure to
apply for a refund within sixty (60) days following expiration or revocation of
the building permit or demolition of the structure shall constitute a waiver of
entitlement to a refund. No interest shall be paid by the city in calculating
the amount of the refunds.
         d.   Time Limit Refunds: Applications for refunds due to the failure
of the city to appropriate development fees collected from the applicant within
the time limits established in subsection E2 of this section shall be made on

the city's failure to appropriate development fee funds for relevant public
facilities.
         e.   Direct Payment Refunds: The city may, at its option, make refunds
of development fees by direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other
development fees due for the same category of public facilities for new
development on the same property, or by other means subject to agreement with
the property owner.

days following the decision which is being appealed; provided, however, that if
the notice of appeal is accompanied by a cash bond or letter of credit in a
form satisfactory to the city attorney and the finance director in an amount
equal to the development fee calculated to be due, a building permit may be
issued to the new development. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the
imposition or the collection of the development fee as calculated by the city
unless a cash bond or other sufficient surety has been provided.
      2.   The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that
the decision of the city is erroneous.
      3.   All appeals shall detail the specific grounds therefor and all other
relevant information and shall be filed on a form provided by the city for such
purposes.
   G.   Exemptions; Waivers:
      1.   Filing Of Application: Petitions for exemptions to the application
of the provisions of this article or waivers from specific development fees
shall be filed with the mayor and council on forms provided by the city.
      2.   Effect Of Grant Of Exemption Or Waiver: If the mayor and council
grants an exemption or waiver in whole or in part of development fees otherwise

development fee ordinances establishing development fees for particular public
facilities, and such funds shall be deposited to the appropriate development
fee account within a reasonable period of time consistent with the applicable
city capital improvements program.
      3.   Development Agreements: Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
city's authority or ability to enter into development agreements pursuant to
Arizona Revised Statutes section 9-500.05 with applicants for new development
who may provide for dedication of land, payments in lieu of development fees,
or actual infrastructure improvements. Such development agreements may allow

or his designee, shall calculate and present to the City Council the inflation
adjustment factor which shall be applied to the development fees on the next
"adjustment date", as defined in Subsection 16A-6.3 of this Section. The
inflationary adjustment factor shall be determined by adding one to the
fraction whose numerator is the index figure stated as the consumer price index
for all urban consumers, west urban region, all goods, 1982-1984=100
(hereinafter "CPI-U") published by the Bureau of Statistics of the United
States Department of Labor for the month of January immediately preceding the

2021, in the case of the first adjustment date, or the CPI-U used for the last
adjustment date, in the case of all adjustments after the first adjustment
date.
      2.   On July 1, 2021, and on July 1st of each year thereafter, in which
the development fees are in effect (hereinafter the "adjustment date"), the
amount of the development fees, per dwelling unit and per one thousand (1,000)
square feet of gross floor area of nonresidential development, shall be
automatically adjusted to account for inflationary increases by multiplying the
then existing development fees by the inflationary index factor as defined in
Subsection 16A-6.2 of this Section.
      3.   Provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the City
Council from electing, by ordinance, to retain the existing development fees or
from electing, by ordinance, to waive the inflation adjustment for any given
fiscal year, years, or other specified time period. After the time period set
forth by the ordinance, retaining the existing development fees or waiving the
inflation adjustment for any given time period, the development fees shall
automatically be adjusted as established in Subsection 16A-6.3 of this Section.

City Council the inflation adjustment factor which shall be applied to the
water and wastewater capacity charges on the next adjustment date, as defined
in subsection 2 of this section. The inflationary adjustment factor shall be
determined by adding one to the fraction whose numerator is the index figure
stated as the "Engineering News Record" annual average construction cost index,

account for inflationary increases by multiplying the then existing water and
wastewater capacity charges by the inflationary adjustment factor as
established in subsection 2 of this section.

Council from electing, by ordinance, to retain the existing water and
wastewater capacity charges or from electing, by ordinance, to waive the
inflation adjustment for any given fiscal year, years, or other specified time
period. After the time period set forth by the ordinance retaining the existing
water and wastewater capacity charges or waiving the inflation adjustment for
any given time period, the water and wastewater capacity charges shall
automatically be adjusted as established in subsection 3 of this section. (Ord.

CHAPTER 16B
RETAIL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TAX INCENTIVES
SECTION:
16B-1: Retail And Economic Development Tax Incentives
16B-1: RETAIL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TAX INCENTIVES:
   A.   City Authority: In order to encourage economic development not
otherwise within the city, the city is authorized to enter into development
agreements with any developer whose development meets the conditions listed in
subsection B of this section.
   B.   Conditions Required For Development Agreement: For a period beginning
with the adoption of this section and continuing until June 30, 2007, any
developer who meets the conditions contained in this subsection can enter into
a development agreement with the city in which the developer agrees to abide by
all the conditions in this subsection in exchange for the reduced tax rate on
certain privilege taxes described in subsection D of this section. The
conditions that must be met by a developer to qualify for a development
agreement include:
      1.   The development must encompass a minimum of two thousand (2,000)
acres not currently within the city, but adjacent thereto.
      2.   The developer must agree to voluntarily annex to the city at least
one thousand five hundred (1,500) acres of the development.
      3.   The development must contain both residential and commercial
components.
      4.   A planned area development for at least seventy five percent (75%)
of the development's acreage must be approved by Pinal County.
      5.   The development must not require the use of city water or sewer
infrastructure to serve the development.
   C.   Compliance With State Statute: Any development agreement entered into
by the city and a developer must comply, to the extent applicable, with all the
requirements of a "retail development tax incentive agreement" as described in
Arizona Revised Statutes section 9-500.11.
   D.   Tax Rates: Pursuant to this section, the rate of taxes to be paid
pursuant to sections 16-415 and 16-416 of the tax code of the city of Eloy,

entered into a development agreement, or any contractor hired by such developer
or any subcontractor thereof shall be reduced to one-third (1/3) of the rate
otherwise set by the city from time to time.
   E.   Rate Reduction Options: The city may choose either to incorporate the
reduced tax rate as part of its city tax code, or, in the alternative, the city
may instruct any taxpayers eligible for the rate reduction of this section to
remit the tax at the full rate otherwise in effect, in which case the city will
then pay to the developer monthly a return of the excess amount of tax payments
(2/3) received from all taxpayers with respect to the development. If the city
elects the latter option, it will require the developer to provide monthly
schedules showing all taxes paid pursuant to sections 16-415 and 16-416 of the
Eloy tax code by the developer, any contractors hired by the developer and any
subcontractors to perform work in the development. Such schedules shall be
subject to the city's right to audit and verification.
   F.   Limitation On Time Period; Termination Of Agreement: Any development
agreement and the tax rate reductions contained therein will remain in effect
for the time period during which the developer is engaged in construction
activities within the development or thirty (30) years, whichever is shorter.

      CITY: The city of Eloy.
      DEVELOPER: Any landowner, agent of such landowner, equitable owner, or
tenant with the permission of the landowner, for whom subdivision or land
development plans are being or have been made.

19-36: PROHIBITED WASTES:
 
   A.   General Prohibitions:
 
      1.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any sewer,
which directly or indirectly connects to the COTW, any wastewater which may
have an adverse or harmful effect on the COTW, COTW personnel or equipment,
COTW effluent quality, public or private property; or which may otherwise
endanger the public, the environment or create a public nuisance, or which
exceeds limitations as set by this article or the director; or causes the COTW
to violate state or federal regulations or permits. Prohibited wastes described
in this section shall not be discharged to the COTW, or to any retention
facility such as, but not limited to, a sump, tank, clarifier, interceptor,
piping or waste treatment system which normally drains or flows to the COTW
collection or treatment systems. Any prohibited wastes found in any of these
facilities shall be presumed to have been discharged to the COTW. Included
within the prohibition, above set forth, is the discharge of any wastes which
adversely affect water reclamation or sludge use.
 
      2.   The director, in determining the acceptability of specific wastes,
shall consider the nature of the waste and adequacy and nature of the
collection, treatment and disposal system available to accept the waste.
 
      3.   The director shall establish quantitative limitations for users
which, because of their location, quantity or quality of discharge, may degrade
wastewater quality to the level that it prevents or inhibits the COTW's efforts
to reclaim the water or causes any unusual operation or maintenance problems in
the COTW.
 
      4.   These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a COTW whether
or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or
any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
 
   B.   Identification Of Additional Prohibited Wastes: When the director
determines that a user is discharging to the COTW any wastes not identified as
prohibited in such amounts as may interfere with the operation of the COTW, the
director shall:
 
      1.   Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the COTW;
 
      2.   Develop a discharge limitation for such user to correct the
interference with the COTW; and
 
      3.   Require the user to obtain an industrial wastewater discharge
permit.
 
   C.   Prohibited Wastes And Discharge Limits: Except as provided in section
19-37 of this article, prohibited wastes shall include the following:
 
      1.   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other
substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the
COTW or to the operation of the COTW. At no time shall two (2) successive
readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the
system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent (5%) nor any
single reading over ten percent (10%) of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the
meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to: gasoline,
kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones,
aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and
sulfides and any other substances which the city, the state or EPA has notified
the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system.
 
      2.   Any waste containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in
such quantities that alone, or in combination with other waste substances, may
create a hazard for humans, animals, or the local environment, interfere
detrimentally with wastewater treatment processes, cause a public nuisance,
cause any hazardous condition to occur in the COTW, or to exceed the limitation
set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall
include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to section
307(a) of the act.
 
      3.   Any waste having a pH lower than 6.0, greater than 9.0, or having
any corrosive or detrimental characteristics that may cause injury to the COTW
or service and maintenance personnel.
 
      4.   Any solids or viscous substances of such size or in such quantities
that they may cause obstruction to flow in the sewer or be detrimental to
proper COTW operations. These objectionable substances include, but are not
limited to, asphalt, asphalt residuals, dead animals, ashes, cinders, sand,
mud, straw, industrial process shavings, stone or marble dust, spent grains,
spent hops, metal, glass, glass grinding or polishing wastes, rags, feathers,
grass clippings, spent lime, tar, plastics, wood, blood, paunch manure, grease,
bones, hair, fleshings, entrails, paper cups, paper dishes, milk cartons or
other similar paper products, either whole or ground.
 
      5.   Any rainwater, storm water, ground water, street drainage, roof
drainage, yard drainage, water from yard fountains, ponds, swimming pools, lawn
sprays or any other uncontaminated water, except where prior approval for such
discharge of uncontaminated water is given by the director.
 
      6.   Any water added for the purpose of diluting wastes which would
otherwise exceed maximum concentration limits.
 
      7.   Any amounts of petroleum or mineral based cutting oils, commonly
called soluble oil, and which form persistent water emulsions.
 
      8.   Any concentrations of nonbiodegradable oil, petroleum oil, or
refined petroleum products in concentrations that would tend to cause adverse

singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public
nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers
for maintenance and repair.
 
      14.   Any waste containing substances, including high pH material, which
cause incrustations, scale or precipitates on sewer walls or other adverse
effects on the sewerage system.
 
      15.   Any substance promoting or causing the promotion of toxic gases.
 
      16.   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the COTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the COTW which exceeds
forty degrees centigrade (40°C) (104°F).
 
      17.   Any wastes with a quantity of chlorine in excess of ten (10) mg/l.
 
      18.   Any excessive amounts of chlorinated hydrocarbon or organic
phosphorus type compounds.
 
      19.   Any deionized water, steam condensate or distilled water in amounts
which cause problems with hydraulic loading.
 
      20.   Any waste containing substances that may precipitate, solidify,
gel, polymerize or become viscous under conditions normally found in the
sewerage system.
 
      21.   Any waste producing discoloration of wastewater or treatment plant
effluent, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
 
      22.   Any garbage or waste, other than that normally found in domestic

      29.   Any sludge from water or wastewater treatment plants not owned and
operated by the city. The director may permit a user to discharge this
substance which is otherwise prohibited by this article if he finds that the
discharge will not adversely affect the operation of the sewerage system. No
such permit shall be issued which would violate any other federal, state or
local rule, regulations or standards.
      30.   Any substance which may cause the COTW's effluent or any other
product of the COTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the COTW cause the COTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under
section 405 of the act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting
sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the solid waste disposal act, the
clean air act, the toxic substances control act, or state criteria applicable
to the sludge management method being used.
      31.   Any substance which will cause the COTW to violate its NPDES and/or
state of Arizona reclaimed wastewater reuse permit, and/or ground water
discharge permit, or receiving water quality standards.
      32.   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.)
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or
has reason to know will cause interference to the COTW. In no case shall a slug
load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that
exceed for any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than five (5)
times the average twenty four (24) hour concentration, quantities, or flow
during normal operation.
   D.   Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards: Upon promulgation of
federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial
subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed
under this article or in a permit issued by the city for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
article and/or the permit. The director shall notify all affected users of
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR section 403.12.
   E.   Modification Of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards: Where the
city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants
limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval
authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment
standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in ninety five percent (95%) of the samples taken when
measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) of title
40 of the code of federal regulations, part 403 - "General Pretreatment
Regulations For Existing And New Sources Of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to
the act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal
pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR part 403,
section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is
obtained.
   F.   State Requirements: State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements
and limitations or those in this article or in a permit issued by the city.
   G.   Excessive Discharge: No user shall increase the use of process water
or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other
pollutant specific limitation developed by the city or state except as set
forth in section 2.1 of SIC, e.g., the pH prohibition.
   H.   Additional Discharge Limits:
      1.   The director shall, from time to time, establish quantitative or
other limitations applicable to waste discharges when, in his judgment, it is
necessary to protect the COTW, assure compliance with federal or state
regulations, or protect public health or environmental quality. Such
limitations shall apply at or upstream from any industrial wastewater
monitoring facility or station prior to mixing with domestic wastewaters,
unless the combined wastewater formula is used.
      2.   Quantitative or other limitations intended for application to
general users and not for inclusion only on individual permits, shall be
proposed to the city council by the director after a public hearing. The
director shall provide notification at least forty five (45) days prior to the
public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city
and by written notice to any person who has filed a request of notification
with the director. The notice shall contain a brief description of the nature
of the proposal to be considered, and the time and place of the hearing. The
directors recommendations and a report on the hearings shall be made to the
city council for approval of discharge limits. (Ord. 87-280 art. III § 2, 8-10-
1987)

         c.   To operate and maintain any waste pretreatment facilities, as may
be required as a condition of the acceptance into the wastewater treatment
system of the industrial wastes involved, in an efficient manner at all times,
and at no expense to the city.
         d.   To cooperate at all times with the city, state and EPA and their
representatives in their inspecting, sampling, and study of the industrial
wastes, and any facilities provided for pretreatment.
         e.   To notify the city immediately in the event of any accident, or
other occurrence that occasions discharge to the wastewater treatment system of
any wastewater or substances prohibited or not covered by the permit.
      2.   The permit shall reflect applicable general and categorical federal
regulations and standards. In addition, no permit shall contain provisions
which excuse compliance with any mandatory requirements of this article.
Permits for new industrial discharges shall require that any pretreatment
facilities deemed necessary by the director shall be operational when the
discharges occur. The director shall be the approval authority for any
submittals. After April 1, 1986, the director shall issue, deny, or not require
a permit within one hundred twenty (120) days of receiving a complete permit
application. However, the approval of such submittals by the director shall in
no way relieve the user of the responsibility for modifying a structure or
procedure as necessary to produce a discharge that meets the requirements of
this article.
   C.   Permit Denial: The director shall deny a permit or permit modification
if a user cannot establish that an industrial discharge will comply with the
requirements of this article.
   D.   Separation Of Wastes: All domestic wastewaters from restrooms, showers,
drinking fountains, and similar sources shall be kept separate from all
industrial wastewaters until the industrial wastewaters have passed through any
required pretreatment facility system or device and the industrial wastewater
monitoring facility. The director may waive this condition and allow the
combined wastewater formula to be used.
   E.   Control Manhole:
      1.   As a condition of the industrial wastewater discharge permit, or
when required by the director, the owner of any property discharging industrial
wastewater to the COTW shall install, at user's expense, a suitable control
manhole together with such meters and other appurtenances deemed necessary by
the director to adequately sample and measure the waste passing through the
control manhole. This control manhole shall be located so as to permit
unrestricted access by representatives of the director, state and EPA. The
control manhole may be used as a junction manhole for domestic sewage and
industrial waste, provided the junction occurs downstream of the sampling and
flow measuring point.
      2.   The director shall approve control manhole details prior to
construction. Construction shall be completed within sixty (60) days following
written approval by the city.
   F.   Self-Monitoring, Chemical Analyses And City Inspection:
      1.   Measurements of industrial discharge flow rates, flow volumes,
chemical strengths or other characteristics for determining compliance with
this article shall be made by the permit holder, at the permits holder's
expense, periodically, as determined by the director. The self-monitoring
requirements for industries subject to EPA categorical regulations must be
equal to, or more stringent than, those set by federal pretreatment
regulations. Sampling shall be performed in a manner that will assure the
integrity of the samples and shall at least comply with federal guidelines and
standards on sampling of wastewater. Analyses of industrial wastewaters shall
be performed by an independent laboratory or by the laboratory of a permit
holder if approved by the director. Prior to submittal of results from chemical
analyses or other information, the results shall be signed by the chemist or
technician performing the analyses, verifying their accuracy. All chemical
analyses shall be conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedures
contained in EPA's "Methods Of Chemical Analysis Of Water And Wastes" or
standard methods (most recent edition). If no appropriate procedure is
contained therein, a procedure approved by the director shall be used to
measure chemical concentrations. Any laboratory or permit holder performing
tests may be required by the director to furnish information on test methods
and equipment used.
      2.   All permit holders making periodic measurements may be required by
the director to furnish and install at the control manhole, or other
appropriate location, a calibrated flume, weir, flow meter or similar device
meeting his approval and suitable to measure the industrial wastewater flow
rate and total volume. A flow indicating, recording, and totalizing register
may be required by the director. In lieu of wastewater flow measurement, the
director may accept records of water usage and adjust the flow volumes by
suitable factors to determine peak and average flow rates for the specific
industrial wastewater discharge. When required by the director, permit holders
shall install and maintain in proper order, automatic flow proportional
sampling equipment and/or automatic analysis and recording equipment. The
sampling, analysis and flow measurement procedures, equipment and results shall
be subject at any reasonable time to inspection by the director. Measurements
to verify the quantities of waste flow and chemical composition and strengths
reported by users shall be conducted on a random basis by personnel of the
director.
   G.   Modification Of Permit:
      1.   Generally:
         a.   Within nine (9) months of the promulgation of a national
categorical pretreatment standard, the industrial wastewater discharge permit
of users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with
such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user,
subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously
submitted an application for an industrial wastewater discharge permit as
required by section
19-43 of this article, the user shall apply for an industrial wastewater
discharge permit within sixty (60) days after the promulgation of the
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. In addition, the user
with an existing industrial wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the
director within sixty (60) days after the promulgation of an applicable federal
categorical pretreatment standard the information required by subsections
19-43B8 and B9 of this article.
         b.   The provisions and conditions of the permit may be modified by
the director during the term of the permit as other limitations or requirements
are modified or for other reasonable cause. The user shall be informed of any
proposed changes in his permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective
date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a
reasonable time schedule for compliance and shall not exempt the user from
meeting ordinance standards. Should measurements or other investigations
indicate that the industrial permit holder is discharging wastewater, chemical
oxygen demand, suspended solids or other wastewater constituent in a quantity
or at a flow rate significantly in excess of that stated in the permit, the
user shall be required to apply for an amended permit. Users who apply for an
amended permit may be required to comply with existing permit provisions prior
to issuance of the amended permit.
      2.   Change In Ownership:
         a.   Industrial wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A permit shall not be reassigned or transferred
or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without the approval of the city. Any succeeding owner or user shall
also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit. Provided the
business only changes ownership, and operations and location do not change,
only a modification of the permit may be needed.
         b.   Permit modifications shall be initiated by the permit holder
thirty (30) days prior to the change, and must be approved by the director.
      3.   Change In Location: Any change in location will require a new
permit.
      4.   Change In Business Operations:
         a.   Any changes in permitted operation that add or change the
constituents or concentrations of any industrial wastewater discharges or
affect any other provisions of this article will require a modification of a
permit. The director may require a new permit when there is a significant
change to the business operations.
         b.   Permit modifications shall be initiated by the permit holder
thirty (30) days prior to the change, and must be approved by the director.
(Ord. 87-280 art. IV § 7, 8-10-1987)
19-45: RECORDS RETENTION:
All permit holders shall retain and preserve for not less than three (3) years,
any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and
all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses
made by or on behalf of a user in connection with its discharge. All records
which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative action or any
other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the city pursuant to this
article shall be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement
activities have concluded and all periods of limitation for appeals have
expired. (Ord. 87-280 art. IV § 8, 8-10-1987)
19-46: COMBINED WASTEWATER FORMULA:
   A.   Formula:
      1.   A combined wastewater formula may be used by industrial users that
mix regulated process wastewaters with other regulated or unregulated
wastewaters prior to pretreatment. The formula was derived to allow calculation
of fixed alternative discharge limits that may be applied to combined
wastewaters; provided, that written permission has been obtained from the
director.
      2.   The alternative discharge limits are derived using the following
formula:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/97c78706155ec6aefd4314531fd743f0812a5245/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2453.gif] 
    where
CT    =    the alternative discharge limit for the combined wastewater
Ci    =    the discharge limit for a pollutant in the regulated wastewater i
Fi    =    the average daily flow (at least a 30 day period) of wastewater i to
the extent that it is regulated for such a pollutant
FD    =    the average daily flow (at least a 30 day period) from boiler
blowdown water, noncontact cooling streams, sanitary wastewater (where such
wastewater is not regulated by this article
FT    =    the average daily flow (at least a 30 day period) through the
combined treatment facility (includes Fi and FD)
N    =    the total number of regulated wastewaters
   B.   Applicable Requirements:
      1.   An alternative discharge limit may not be used if the alternative
limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated
pollutants.
      2.   An industrial user is required to monitor his own wastewater to
ensure compliance with the alternative discharge limits determined by the
combined wastewater formula.
   C.   Approval Requirement: The combined wastewater formula shall only be
used with the director's approval and in no case shall the alternative
discharge limits exceed the applicable federal categorical pretreatment
standards. (Ord. 87-280 art. IV § 9, 8-10-1987)

the city water department. The reduced pressure principal assembly, pressure
vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly shall be installed
aboveground.
   C.   Parallel Installations: When a customer desires a continuous water
supply, two (2) backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed parallel to
one another at the service connection to allow a continuous water supply during
testing of the backflow prevention assemblies. When backflow prevention
assemblies are installed parallel to one another, the sum of the cross
sectional areas of the assemblies shall be at least equal to the cross
sectional area of the service connection.
   D.   Approval To Alter Or Remove: No person shall alter, modify, bypass or
remove a backflow prevention method without the approval of the city water
department. (Ord. 93-378, 12-27-1993)
19-68: BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLIES FOR FIRE SYSTEMS:
In addition to the requirements of section
19-66 of this article, the following shall also apply:
   A.   Fire Systems:
      1.   Fire protection systems consist of sprinklers, hose connections, and
hydrants. Sprinkler systems may be dry or wet, open or closed. Systems of fixed
spray nozzles may be used indoors or outdoors for protection of flammable
liquid and other hazardous processes. It is standard practice, especially in
cities, to equip automatic sprinkler systems with fire department pumper
connections.
      2.   A meter (compound, detector check) should not normally be permitted
as part of a backflow prevention assembly. An exception may be made, however,
if the meter and backflow prevention assembly are specifically designed for
that purpose.
      3.   For cross connection control, fire protection systems shall be
classified on the basis of water source and arrangement of supplies as follows:
         a.   Class 1: Direct connections from public water mains only; no
pumps, tanks or reservoirs; no physical connection from other water supplies;
no antifreeze or other additives of any kind; all sprinkler drains discharging
to atmosphere, dry wells, or other safe outlets.
         b.   Class 2: Same as class 1 except that booster pumps may be
installed in the connections from the street mains. Booster pumps do not affect
the potability of the system; it is necessary, however, to avoid drafting so
much water that pressure in the water main is reduced below twenty (20) psi.
         c.   Class 3:
(1) Direct connection from public water supply main, plus one or more of the
following: elevated storage tanks; fire pumps taking suction from aboveground,
covered reservoirs or tanks; and pressure tanks (all storage facilities are
filled or connected to public water only, the water in the tanks to be
maintained in a potable condition).
(2) Otherwise, class 3 systems are the same as class 1. Class 3 systems will
generally require minimum protection (approved double check valves) to prevent
stagnant waters from backflowing into the public potable water system.
         d.   Class 4: Directly supplied from public mains similar to classes 1
and 2, and with an auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises; or
an auxiliary supply may be located within one thousand seven hundred feet
(1,700') of the pumper connection. Class 4 systems will normally require
backflow protection at the service connection. The type (air gap or reduced
pressure) will generally depend on the quality of the auxiliary supply.
         e.   Class 5: Directly supplied from public mains, and interconnected
with auxiliary supplies, such as: pumps taking suction from reservoirs exposed
to contamination, or rivers and ponds; driven wells, mills or other industrial
water systems; or where antifreeze or other additives are used. Class 4 and 5
systems normally would need maximum protection (air gap or reduced pressure) to
protect the public potable water system.
         f.   Class 6: Combined industrial and fire protection systems supplied
from the public water mains only, with or without gravity storage or pump
suction tanks. Class 6 system protection would depend on the requirements of
both industry and fire protection, and could only be determined by a survey of
the premises.
   B.   Installation: When a backflow prevention assembly is required for a
water service connection supplying water only to a fire system, the assembly
shall be installed on the service line in compliance with standard
specifications adopted by the city. (Installation of DCVAs or DDCVAs in a
vertical position on the riser may be allowed on fire systems with the city
water department approval.) (Ord. 93-378, 12-27-1993)
19-69: INSPECTIONS:
A customer's water system shall be available at all times during business
operations for premises inspection by the city water department. The inspection
shall be conducted to determine whether any cross connection or other hazard
potentials exist and to determine compliance with this article and
modifications, if any, pursuant to section
19-72 of this article. (Ord. 93-378, 12-27-1993)
19-70: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS; INSPECTION:
   A.   Installation Permits: Installation permits for the installation of all
backflow prevention assemblies required by the city water department shall be
obtained from the city water department prior to installation. A separate
permit shall be obtained for each required backflow prevention assembly to be
installed, including replacement.
   B.   Notify City Of Work Ready For Inspection: It shall be the duty of the
person doing the work authorized by the permit to notify the city water
department, orally or in writing, that said work is ready for inspection. Such
notification shall be given not less than twenty four (24) hours before the
work is to be inspected and shall be given only if there is reason to believe
that the work done will meet UPC and current USC standards, as are referenced
in the backflow prevention manuals.
   C.   Stop Orders: Whenever any work is being done contrary to the provisions
of the UPC or this code, the city water department or an authorized
representative may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any
persons engaged in the doing or causing such work to be done, and any such
person shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the city water
department to proceed with the work.
   D.   Suspension Or Revocation: The city water department or any employee
may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under provisions of this
code, whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect
information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation of any
provision of the UPC or this code. (Ord. 93-378, 12-27-1993)
19-71: TEST, MAINTENANCE, RECORDS:
   A.   Testing And Repairs Required: The customer shall test and service
backflow prevention assemblies at least once a year. If the testing reveals the
assembly to be defective or in unsatisfactory operating condition, the customer
shall perform any necessary repairs, including replacement or overhaul of the
assembly, if necessary, which will return the assembly to satisfactory
operating condition.
   B.   Repairs Between Tests: If the city water department or a customer
learns or discovers, during the interim period between tests, that an assembly
is defective or in unsatisfactory operating condition, the customer shall
perform necessary repairs, which will return the assembly to satisfactory
operating condition.
   C.   Certified Testers: The annual testing shall be performed by an
individual certified to conduct such testing by an agency approved by the city
water department. A list of certified, approved and recognized individuals will
be maintained by the city water department and will be available upon request
to all persons required to install or maintain a backflow prevention assembly.
A certification issued to a backflow prevention assembly tester may be revoked
or suspended for improper testing, maintenance, reporting or other improper
practices.
   D.   Records Of Tests: The customer shall maintain records, on forms
approved by the city water department, of the results of all tests and all
servicing, repairs, overhauls or replacements of the backflow prevention
assembly. A copy of the records shall be promptly submitted to the city water
department after completion of the activity for which the record is made.
   E.   Out Of Service Time Limitation: Fire systems shall not be out of
service for more than eight (8) consecutive hours due to testing, maintenance,
or repairs. The Eloy fire district shall be notified immediately of any changes
in fire service status. (Ord. 93-378, 12-27-1993)
19-72: MODIFICATION OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION REQUIREMENTS:
If the city water department determines, after inspection of the customer's
system, that a backflow prevention method less restrictive than that required
in section
19-66 of this article will provide adequate protection of the public potable
water supply from the degree of hazard potential by the customer's water
system, the city water department may, at its sole discretion, modify the
requirements of section
19-66 of this article accordingly. (Ord. 93-378, 12-27-1993)
19-73: DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SERVICE:
   A.   If the city water department discovers that a customer has not
installed a required backflow prevention method or that a backflow prevention
method has been improperly tested or maintained, bypassed or removed, or that
an unprotected cross connection exists in the customer's water system, the
water service to that service connection shall be disconnected if the situation
is not remedied within the time specified in the notice sent to the customer as
required by this section. The service shall not be restored until the condition
is remedied.
   B.   Water service to a fire sprinkler system shall not be subject to
disconnection under this section. If a situation, which would otherwise result
in discontinuance of water service in subsection A of this section, is not
remedied within the time provided in the notice sent to the customer, multiple
violations will accrue.
   C.   Prior to disconnecting any water service because a condition set forth
in subsection A of this section exists, the city water department shall issue a
notice to the customer describing the condition and notifying the customer that
the condition must be remedied within forty five (45) days from the initial
inspection date. If there is no immediate action on the part of the customer, a
second notice by certified mail shall be sent thirty (30) days after the
initial inspection date stating that water service will be disconnected within
fifteen (15) days of the second notice. If there is still no action, a turn off
notice shall be sent to the customer stating that service will be disconnected
on a date certain (approximately 7 days from the date of the turn off notice).
(For retrofit notification procedures, see section
19-75 of this article.)
   D.   The city water department may disconnect, without notice, water service
to any customer when the city water department discovers that a direct,
contaminated cross connection exists in the customer's water system. (Ord. 93-
378, 12-27-1993)
19-74: ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL:
An administrative appeal may be requested whenever a violation or dispute of
any of the requirements of this article is determined, whether during
construction or at the plan review stage, and the applicant wishes to appeal
the decision of the staff because of code interpretation, unreasonable hardship
or other acceptable reasons. The appeal may be made to the backflow and cross
connection hearing committee as follows:

   B.   Site Plan Approved Prior To Effective Date: An applicant whose
development has received site plan approval prior to the effective date of this
chapter may file an application for a building permit in compliance with the
approved site plan and any conditions of approval, even if the development does
not comply with the provisions of this chapter. Upon approval of construction
plans for the development, a building permit may be issued. Site plan approval
for developments approved prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be
valid for one year from the date of plan approval. No time extensions shall be
permitted. Any re-application for an expired project approval shall meet the
standards in effect at the time of re-application.

is issued or for which a complete building permit or sign permit application,
as determined by the Community Development Director, has been filed prior to
the effective date of this chapter, may be constructed and completed in
conformance with the permit and other applicable approvals, permits and
conditions, even if such building, structure or sign does not fully comply with
this chapter. If construction is not commenced in compliance with the
applicable permit terms, the building official may grant an extension in
compliance with the provisions of the Building Code. If the building,
structure, or sign has not been completed before the building permit or any
extension of the permit expires, then the building, structure, or sign shall be
constructed, completed or occupied only in compliance with this chapter.
      2.   For any building, structure, or development for which plans have
been reviewed and approved by the City, under the terms of the previous
ordinance, the applicant has one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the
date the City notifies him/her that the plans are approved and permits are
ready to be issued; and to pay for said permit and commence construction; said
building, structure, or development shall be in compliance with this chapter.

All lands located within the incorporated limits of the City of Eloy are hereby
zoned and organized into a coordinated set of Residential and Non-Residential
Zoning Districts and Overlay Districts. These districts are established to
implement the goals, objectives and policies of the Eloy General Plan and to
conserve and promote the public health, safety and general welfare. Residential
Zoning Districts are primarily intended to create, maintain and promote a
variety of neighborhoods that allow a range of compatible densities to
accommodate the desired physical character of the City. Nonresidential
Districts uses are also allowed to improve the overall quality of life by
providing a convenience of services and goods for Eloy residents and provide
public facilities necessary to create a healthy and safe environment in which
to live.

21-2-1.2: ZONING MAP ESTABLISHED:
   A.   The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this
chapter shall be designated upon the official "Zoning Map of the City of Eloy".
The Zoning Map, together with all data shown on the map and all amendments
hereafter adopted, is by reference made a part of this chapter.
   B.   The Official Zoning Map of the City of Eloy, dated and signed by the
Mayor and City Clerk, is hereby adopted and shall be located in the Office of
the City Zoning Administrator with a copy retained on file with the City Clerk.
All future changes adopted by the Eloy City Council to the Official Zoning Map
of the City of Eloy shall be clearly documented by the City Zoning
Administrator on the Official Zoning Map adopted on the date and year set forth
herein.
      1.   Any changes to the Official Zoning Map shall be considered an
amendment to the Official Zoning Map and filed in accordance with section
21-6-6 of this chapter.
      2.   The Official Zoning Map may, from time to time, be republished to
delineate any change of zoning approved pursuant to section
21-6-6 of this chapter or any other amendments thereto. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-
2018)
21-2-1.3: BOUNDARY DETERMINATION:
   A.   Where uncertainty exists concerning the boundaries of any zoning
district shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
      1.   Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following street or alley center lines, such center lines shall be construed to
be the district boundary.
      2.   Where zoning district boundaries are so indicated that they
approximately follow property lines, such property lines shall be construed to
be the district boundary.
      3.   Where zoning district boundaries divide a lot or parcel, the zoning
boundary shall be determined by using the scale of the Official Zoning Map,
unless indicated by legal description with distance and bearing or other
dimension. Such zoning district boundary shall be considered a "lot line" as
defined herein. If the area created by such lot line does not comply with the
designated district lot area and lot width requirements, zoning for the entire
parcel shall be that which is applied to the largest portion of the property.
      4.   Where a public street or alley, railroad, or utility right-of- way
is officially vacated or abandoned, the property that was formerly in the
right-of-way will be included within the zoning district of the adjoining
property on either side of the centerline of the vacated or abandoned right-of-
way or easement.
      5.   Where a zoning district boundary divides a lot or parcel, the
location of such boundary, unless indicated by legal description with distance
and bearing or other dimension, shall be determined by scaling the Official
Zoning Map by the City Zoning Administrator.
      6.   Where a lack of clarity or disagreement concerning the exact
location of a zoning district line exists, determination shall lie with the
interpretation of the City Zoning Administrator as defined under section
21-5-5 of this chapter. The determination of the Zoning Administrator may be
appealed in accordance with the provisions of section
 21-6-2.11, "Appeals", of this chapter. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-2: RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS:
21-2-2.1: GENERAL PURPOSE:
Residential Zoning Districts are primarily intended to create, maintain and
promote a variety of neighborhoods that allow for a range of compatible
densities to accommodate the desired physical character of the City. These
districts primarily accommodate residential uses; however, some nonresidential
uses are also allowed to provide other uses necessary to support a healthy,
sustainable and safe environment. These uses also include associated, limited
nonresidential uses that are required by law such as religious, educational and
recreational facilities. The Residential Districts are described in section
21-2-2.2 of this section
21-2-2. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-2.2: RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS ENUMERATED:
   A.   Rural Residential (RR-20): The purpose of this Rural Residential Zoning
District is to provide areas for large, more intense agricultural activities,
ranching land uses, and their related activities, in appropriate locations with
buffering to mitigate the negative impacts upon, or from, such operations. The
minimum lot size is twenty (20) acres. The intent is to protect areas that
exhibit productive agricultural soils and existing or desired ranching uses
from incompatible land uses and urban encroachment. This district is
appropriate where very low density residential development is desired, where
minimal public facilities and services are programmed or anticipated, and in
aviation overflight areas. The RR-20 Zoning District may also act as a holding
zone to prevent the premature conversion of rural lands to suburban or urban
uses and until there exists adequate public facilities and an appropriate
development plan.
   B.   Rural Residential (RR-5): The purpose of this Rural Residential Zoning
District is to provide for, and conserve, existing rural, ranch, and very low
density residential uses in their present or desired character, and to foster
orderly growth. The minimum lot size is five (5) acres. The intent of this
district is to allow for areas where small ranching and semirural residential
uses can be maintained without imposing/receiving conflicts from higher density
development. This district is appropriate where low density development is
desired, as a buffer for these uses from the more intense agricultural uses of
the RR-20 District, and in aviation overflight areas.
   C.   Rural Residential (RR-2.5): The purpose of this Rural Residential
Zoning District is to provide an open, low-density country residential
atmosphere on large lots. Lots are typically larger than in the developed
portion of the City and can include area(s) for large livestock for non-
commercial purposes. The minimum lot size is two and one-half (2.5) acres. This
district is compatible with the Estate Residential Districts and can also serve
as a buffer and transition to the higher density Residential Districts.
   D.   Estate Residential (R1-54): The purpose of this Estate Residential
District is to provide an appropriate zoning district for the transition of
newly annexed property into the City of Eloy, so as to equitably accommodate a
comparable zoning district affording similar densities and intensities of
residential land uses that were prescribed under the former County zoning
district designation. The minimum lot size is fifty four thousand four hundred
fifty (54,450) square feet (approximately 1.25 acres). This district is
compatible with Rural Residential and Estate Residential Zoning Districts, but
could also be utilized as a holding district until future zoning requests that
are consistent with the General Plan land use designation(s) can be
established. Single-family homes in this district shall not include
manufactured homes unless approved in conjunction with a separate/additional
Overlay Zoning District.
   E.   Estate Residential (R1-43): The purpose of this Estate Residential
Zoning District is to foster orderly growth in the transitional or fringe
areas, whereby large lot residential uses would be most appropriate. The
minimum lot size is forty three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square
feet (1.0 acre). The intent of this district is to provide a pastoral character
and home sites that create an open environment and to provide a transition land
use buffer between the rural land uses and single-family residential land uses.
Single-family homes in this district shall not include manufactured homes
unless approved in conjunction with a separate/additional Overlay Zoning
District.
   F.   Single-Family Residential (R1-12): The purpose of this Single- Family
Residential District is to provide a transition from rural residential and/or
estate development to more suburban residential neighborhoods. Development in
this district is generally comprised of moderate sized-lot (minimum 12,000
square feet in area) single-family detached homes with more conventional
residential amenities such as sidewalks, public utility services and other
improvements. Single-family homes in this district shall not include
manufactured homes unless approved in conjunction with a separate/additional
Overlay Zoning District.
   G.   Single-Family Residential (R1-6): The purpose of this Single- Family
Residential Zoning District is to provide smaller lot sizes than other single-
family districts while maintaining a traditional single-family neighborhood
character. Development in this district should also include non-motorized
linkages to community and neighborhood services such as schools, parks and
shopping areas. All public utilities and facilities must be in place at the
time of first dwelling unit occupancy. Certain essential and complementary uses
are permitted under residential use standards which ensure their compatibility
with the character of the district. Single-family homes in this district shall
not include manufactured homes unless approved in conjunction with a separate/
additional Overlay Zoning District.
   H.   Small Lot Residential (R-2): The purpose of this Small Lot Residential
Zoning District is to provide for neighborhoods consisting of a mixture of
single-family detached and attached homes including small-lot residential
dwellings such as duplexes, townhomes, and/or patio homes together with
schools, parks, trails and other supportive public facilities. Anticipated
project densities may range between 6 - 10 dwelling units per acre (gross) for
single family detached units and from 6 - 12 dwelling units per acre (gross)
for all other residential uses, with heights limited to two (2) stories. This
district may serve as a transition between Multi-Family Residential Districts
and Single-Family Residential Districts. Single-family homes in this district
shall not include manufactured homes unless approved in conjunction with a
separate/additional Overlay Zoning District.
   I.   Multiple Family Residential (R-3): The purpose of this Multiple Family
Residential Zoning District is to allow for higher densities to provide a
balance of housing opportunities in the community. Anticipated project
densities may range between 10 - 24 dwelling units per acre (gross), with
typical heights limited to three (3) stories. This district is most appropriate
in the downtown area, adjacent to large shopping or employment centers, or
within a large PAD. The district requires direct connection to higher volume
roadways and all public utilities. The maximum density is twenty four (24)
dwelling units per acre. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-2.3: RESIDENTIAL USE STANDARDS:
Table 2.2-1, "Table Of Allowed Uses For Residential Districts", of this
section, lists land uses and indicates whether they are permitted by right or
with approval of a conditional use permit (CUP), or prohibited within each
zoning district. The use table also includes references to additional use-
specific standards that may be applicable to that use. The organization
headings and individual abbreviations utilized in the table are identified as
follows:
   A.   Use Category: The "use category" is intended to provide a quick
reference to organize the specific uses. Such categories are not regulatory.
   B.   Specific Use Type: The "specific use type" is regulatory and functions
as the basis for listing the existing and future land uses that are considered
in each zoning district. Rather than list every possible individual land use
type, this list classifies individual land uses and activities into specific
use types based on common functional, product or physical characteristics; such
as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, and how
goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The definition of
each specific use type is located in section
21-9-1, "Definitions", of this chapter.
   C.   Permitted Uses (P): A "P" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
by right in the respective zoning district.
   D.   Conditional Uses (C): A "C" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
with a conditional use permit in the respective zoning district. Conditional
use permits must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of
section
21-6-7 of this chapter.
   E.   Not Permitted (NP): An "NP" in a cell indicates that the use is not
permitted (is prohibited) in the respective zoning district.
   F.   Overlay District Uses (O): An "O" designates uses that may be permitted
but must exercise the use of a Zoning Overlay District used in conjunction with
the underlying zoning district. Zoning Overlay Districts must be considered and
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
   G.   Use-Specific Standards: Section numbers listed in the "Supplemental Use
Regulations" column denote the location of additional regulations that are
applicable to the specific use type; however, provisions in other sections of
this chapter may also apply.
   H.   Non-Specified Uses: When a use cannot be reasonably classified into a
specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple specific use types, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar, and thus most
appropriate, specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics
of the individual use or activity (including but not limited to size, scale,
operating characteristics and external impacts) in relationship to the specific
use type definitions provided in section
21-9-1 of this chapter. Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision may be
filed with the Community Development Department and heard by the Board of
Adjustment in conformance with the procedures of section
21-6-2.11 of this chapter.

21-2-2.5: SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES:
The following design requirements and guidelines shall apply to single-family
residential subdivisions and certain types of residential units built within
the City other than those located in planned area developments (PAD). The
intent of these requirements and guidelines is to establish a minimum level of
residential community expectations within Eloy as well as a consistent method
of evaluating new projects. The guidelines set objectives for the developer/
designer to meet and are not intended to restrict or impede creativity and
imagination. In the event that a conflict exists between the provisions of this
section and the Single-Family Residential Districts of table 2.2-2 in section
21-2-2.4 of this section
21-2-2, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
   A.   Requirements For Single-Family Residential Subdivisions:
      1.   Each project shall have a unique entry feature at its primary
entrances to provide individual identity to the development. Entry features may
include a combination of the following elements: entrance paving, distinctive
landscaping treatment, distinctive structural element (statue, windmill, etc.)
planters, special wall/column treatment, gates and other entry features.

required along the rear of reverse frontage single-family lots along collector
or arterial streets. Such walls shall be constructed of slump block, brick, or
masonry with stucco or mortar wash finish and decoratively designed with
details such as inlaid tile or brick work, cap tiles, wall inserts, offsets, or
pilaster treatments. Long, straight, unbroken walls are not permitted.
Landscaping is required to be installed in accordance with City standards
within collector or arterial rights-of-way.
      3.   The undergrounding of all utilities less than sixty nine (69) kV
(kilovolts), within and abutting the proposed development, shall occur prior to

of a letter of approval from the Pinal County Flood Control District explaining
that the development is not located in the floodplain or the measures to
protect development located in the floodplain.
      7.   Separation of any production crops on land owned by the property
owner for whom the rezoning is sought or such owners and successors on the
property herein zoned by not less than fifty feet (50') from the nearest
adjacent property boundary, if applicable.
      8.   A homeowner association (HOA) shall be required to be formed for a
new residential subdivision.
   B.   Single-Family Residential Site Design Guidelines:
      1.   Housing should foster a sense of neighborhood among nearby residents
and a sense of community through linkage with surrounding neighborhoods.
      2.   All new residential development (subdivisions) should include a
pedestrian and bicycle multi-use pathway as part of the required open space as
per the Eloy General Plan. If applicable, such pathway shall be designed,
located and oriented to provide: a) pedestrian and bicycle accessibility within
and around the development; b) connections to adjacent developments to enhance
a network of multi-modal circulation throughout the community; and c) a buffer
between undeveloped, less densely developed lands and developed land use
patterns.
      3.   In an effort to reduce street pavement widths and eliminate driveway
curb cuts, the use of alleyways with rear garage configurations and entry
access points may be considered as a primary means of access to a residential
lot.
      4.   Developments containing alleyways should plan and design the
alleyways as a secure pedestrian way that links to the neighborhood pedestrian
and bicycle multiuse pathways and open space system.
      5.   Residential structures should have a strong relationship to the

system.
      3.   If the open space area (subdivision) is to be dedicated for public
use it shall be located to provide access and physical connections to adjacent
neighborhoods and to the community open space network and trail system or to
provide protection to adjacent public lands.
      4.   The landscaped portion of a private street tract may be counted as
open space only if the private street is constructed to the local street
standards as shown in the City of Eloy Subdivision Ordinance. However, this
landscaped area may not count towards more than twenty five percent (25%) of
the required open space.
   D.   Single-Family Residential Architectural Requirements:
      1.   Roof mounted mechanical equipment on new buildings is prohibited.
Mechanical equipment, electrical meter and service components, propane tanks,
coolers, water filters and similar utility equipment shall be installed at
ground level or wall mounted and shall be screened from public view and

      2.   All new single-family residences in new subdivisions shall include a
minimum two (2) car garage. Carports shall be permitted in subdivisions that
were approved before August 2020 and subdivisions with a manufactured home
overlay. If a carport is permitted, new single-family residences and
manufactured homes shall have, at a minimum, a single car carport. The design
and materials of garages and carports shall be compatible with the main
structure. Existing carports shall not be enclosed unless substituted with an
additional carport or garage on the property. In RR-20, RR-5, RR-2.5, R1-54 and
R1-43 zoning districts, the garage area shall not exceed thirty-five percent
(35%) of the front face plane of the residential structure.
   E.   Single-Family Residential Architectural Guidelines:

untarnished metallic surfaces, including roof materials, should be chemically
treated so they are non-reflective.
      2.   Earth tone paint and material colors should have a light reflective
value (LRV) no greater than forty percent (40%). Limited use of contrasting
accenting colors in excess of forty percent (40%) LRV for small elements such
as entryways and special architectural features of the building may be allowed.
      3.   Detached garages and side entry garages are strongly encouraged.
      4.   Front porches and courtyards are strongly encouraged and should
provide a pedestrian connection, other than the driveway, to the street.
      5.   Rooflines with differing heights and style combinations, stepping,
or different orientations are strongly encouraged.
      6.   All four (4) exterior elevations of a residential structure should
provide architectural detailing; not just the front elevation.
      7.   Window embellishments should be provided on all houses by adding
architectural features which enhance the elevations, e.g., sturdy synthetic
wood substitutes, greater variation of window design, different window styles,
tile inlays and recesses, structural pop outs, gabled roof features over the
windows, etc. Such features should be added to all of the exterior elevations
of the house to provide interest and relief.
      8.   All tract home developments should have a minimum of four (4) floor
plans, with a minimum of three (3) distinctly different elevations for each
floor plan. Additionally, a minimum of three (3) colors of roof material, three
(3) styles of garage doors and three (3) exterior paint motifs should be used
to promote visual interest and architectural diversity. The same elevations
should not be utilized across from or adjacent to each other. (Ord. 18-880, 7-

screen the undercarriages of the parked vehicles.
      3.   Trash and refuse collection locations shall be screened with a six
foot (6') decorative masonry wall that is finished to match the exterior
elevation of the dwelling units. Trash and refuse areas shall be located such
that they are not the visual focal point of a driveway or parking area, and
cannot be viewed directly from a public street.
      4.   All multiple family residential developments, having more than four
(4) dwelling units, shall provide amenities for the residents' use. Examples of

   E.   Multiple Family Residential Architectural Guidelines:
      1.   All buildings should incorporate three hundred sixty degree (360°)
architecture, a variety of massing and building heights, and stepping
rooflines. Straight rooflines should be varied by using offsets, differing
heights, stepping, or different orientations to produce more variety within a
development. Roof material should not be wood shake shingles.
      2.   All of the exterior elevations of the structures should provide
interest and relief and utilize architectural detailing and overhanging eaves.
Embellish window treatments on buildings by adding architectural features,
which enhance the elevations, e.g., gabled roof features over windows,
structural pop outs, recesses, headers, tile inlays, different window designs
and styles.
      3.   Reflective building materials are strongly discouraged. Mirrored
surfaces or any treatment that changes ordinary glass into a mirror surface are
discouraged. Metallic surfaces, including roof materials, should be chemically
treated to be non-reflective. Earth tone paint and material colors should have
a light reflective value (LRV) no greater than forty percent (40%). Limited use
of contrasting accenting colors in excess of forty percent (40%) LRV for small
elements such as entryways and special architectural features of the building
may be allowed.
      4.   All of the dwelling units within the development should have a
strong design/orientation to one another, to the common open space and to the
neighborhood street. A walkway from the street to the front entry is strongly
encouraged. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018; Ord. 20-891, 1-27-2020)
21-2-3: COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS:
21-2-3.1: GENERAL PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts is to provide for a
variety of goods, services and housing, each suited to specific retail, office,
entertainment, and moderate to high density residential uses in order to foster
economic health, community sustainability and also to maintain compatibility
with adjacent uses. These districts are intended to provide attractive, well-
designed developments that are appropriately located along primary roadways and
multi-modal transportation facilities to serve Eloy residents, customers, and
visitors. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-3.2: COMMERCIAL AND MIXED-USE DISTRICTS ENUMERATED:
   A.   Neighborhood Commercial District (C-1): The purpose of this Commercial
Zoning District is to provide a location for small scale, well designed
professional offices and smaller shops and services in convenient locations to
meet the daily needs of residents in the surrounding neighborhood. It is
intended that this district restrict its range of uses to those that satisfy
the daily commercial, office, and service needs of the immediate surrounding
neighborhood.
   B.   General Commercial District (C-2): The purpose of this Commercial
Zoning District is to provide a location for general business and commercial
uses. The intent of this district is to allow for larger commercial uses to
satisfy the needs of the community at large while providing for a broad range
of retail, office and service oriented activities.
   C.   Mixed-Use District (MU): The purpose of this Mixed-Use District is to
allow the inclusion of both residential and non- residential uses, either
vertically or horizontally, on one parcel of land. The intent is to promote
site and building design that accommodates multi-modal mobility that creates
opportunities to live, work and recreate within newly developing greenfield
sites, near existing neighborhoods and/or near the Downtown Core area.
Residential densities ranging from ten (10) to twenty four (24) dwelling units
per acre are permitted. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-3.3: COMMERCIAL AND MIXED-USE STANDARDS:
Table 2.3-1, "Table Of Allowed Uses For Commercial And Mixed-Use Districts", of
this section, lists land uses and indicates whether they are permitted by right
or with approval of a conditional use permit (CUP), or prohibited within each
zoning district. The use table also includes references to additional use-
specific standards that may be applicable to that use. The organization
headings and individual abbreviations utilized in the table are identified as
follows:
   A.   Use Category: The "use category" is intended to provide a quick
reference to organize the specific uses. Such categories are not regulatory.
   B.   Specific Use Type: The "specific use type" is regulatory and functions
as the basis for listing the existing and future land uses that are considered
in each zoning district. Rather than list every possible individual land use
type, this list classifies individual land uses and activities into specific
use types based on common functional, product or physical characteristics; such
as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, and how
goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The definitions of
each specific use type are located in section
21-9-1, "Definitions", of this chapter.
   C.   Permitted Uses (P): A "P" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
by right in that zoning district.
   D.   Conditional Uses (C): A "C" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
with a conditional use permit in the respective zoning district. Conditional
use permits must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of
section
21-6-7 of this chapter.
   E.   Not Permitted (NP): An "NP" in a cell indicates that the use is
prohibited in the respective zoning district.
   F.   Use-Specific Standards: Section numbers listed in the "Supplemental Use
Regulations" column denote the location of additional regulations that are
applicable to the specific use type; however, provisions in other sections of
this chapter may also apply.
   G.   Non-Specified Uses: When a use cannot be reasonably classified into a
specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple specific use types, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most
appropriate specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics
of the individual use or activity (including but not limited to size, scale,
operating characteristics and external impacts) in relationship to the specific
use type definitions provided in section 21-9-1 of this chapter. Appeal of the
Zoning Administrator's decision may be filed with the Community Development
Department and heard by the Board of Adjustment in conformance with the
procedures of section 21-6-2.11 of this chapter.

(Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018; Ord. 24-981, 10-14-2024, eff 11-14-2024)
21-2-3.5: COMMERCIAL AND MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES:
The commercial and mixed-use development requirements and guidelines have been
established to: create an attractive and functional setting for businesses
located along primary roadway corridors; create and maintain an efficient,
functional, safe and pleasant built environment for residents and visitors; and
promote attractive, high quality development that will support and enhance the
greater community.
   A.   Applicability: These requirements and guidelines shall apply to the
development of new buildings or renovation of existing buildings within any
Commercial and Mixed-Use Zoning District in the City of Eloy, unless otherwise
specified within this section. In the case of mixed-use buildings, the single-
family residential guidelines of this section and the guidelines of sections
 21-2-3.4 and
21-2-3.5 of this section
21-2-3, commercial development, shall both apply.
These requirements and guidelines will be used by City staff and the Planning
and Zoning Commission as a framework for evaluating development proposals and
for consideration of design aspects of such proposed projects. The Eloy
subdivision regulations should also be referenced for additional site design
standards specifically applicable to commercial and mixed-use developments.
   B.   Architectural Guidelines:
      1.   Natural materials and deep earth tone colors are preferred, and
design elements should not primarily consist of metal, glass, plastic, highly
reflective materials and bright colors. Such materials may have limited
application in trim or accent areas, but should not be the predominant visual
elements of the building(s) or site improvements.
      2.   Large, bland monolithic facades or rooflines and repetition of very
simple details foster a monotonous character, which should be avoided. Building
elevations should create a unique character which is emphasized through
interesting architectural details or facade articulation in each component. For
example, windows may be arched or rectangular, bayed out or recessed, have
raised borders, awnings, planter boxes or shutters.
      3.   All building facades should be designed with architecturally
finished materials, with primary building materials limited to the following:
         a.   Modular masonry materials such as brick, block, and stone.
         b.   Precast concrete or aggregate panels with a decorative finish.
         c.   Stucco or stucco-like materials.
         d.   Wood, provided the surfaces are finished for exterior use and
wood of proven exterior durability.
         e.   Other materials as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      4.   The following building types and materials are discouraged:
         a.   Galvanized or unfinished steel, galvalume or unfinished aluminum
buildings (walls or roofs), unless the roadway facing the facade of the
building is specifically intended to have a corrosive designed finish such as
Cor-Ten steel or is finished with a material that is compliant with subsection
B3 of this section.
         b.   Exposed, untextured, uncolored, unaugmented concrete.
   C.   Site Design/Orientation Requirements:
      1.   Buildings, structures, open space areas and other features shall be
oriented to protect and/or enhance major vistas and panoramas that accentuate
mountain vistas, and/or special man- made or natural landmarks.
      2.   On-site pedestrian walks shall be provided to connect street
sidewalks to primary commercial and mixed-use building entries by the most
direct route practicable. Multi-building developments shall minimize auto/
pedestrian conflicts and maximize convenient pedestrian access between
buildings.
      3.   Openings for vehicular uses, such as garage door bays used to access
vehicles into and out of a building for repair or storage, must be located on
facades that do not face the primary street.
   D.   Circulation Requirements:
      1.   Proposed developments fronting ADOT controlled roadways shall
complete a traffic impact analysis (TIA), including access needs, traffic
control needs, highway expansion needs, drainage management plan, and/or a cost
sharing plan. ADOT approval will be required as part of the development plan
approval process.
      2.   Developments along public roadways may be required to complete a
traffic study analysis, including access needs, traffic control needs, highway
expansion needs, drainage management plan, and/or a cost sharing plan. The
approval of the Eloy City Engineer will be required as part of the development
plan approval process.
      3.   Vehicular access points along arterial and collector roadways shall
be placed and designed in accordance with ADOT and/or City requirements.
   E.   Utility Requirements:
      1.   All on-site electric utility and all other communication and utility
lines for buildings shall be placed underground. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018; Ord.
20-891, 1-27-2020)
21-2-3.6: ADDITIONAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Parking And Loading Requirements: See section
21-4-1, "Off- Street Parking And Loading", of this chapter for additional
development and design regulations.
   B.   Landscaping And Screening Requirements: See section
21-4-2 of this chapter for additional development and design regulations
relating to fencing, screening and landscaping.
   C.   Signage Requirements: See section
21-4-3, "Signage", of this chapter for additional development and design
regulations.
   D.   Outdoor Lighting Requirements: See section
21-4-5, "Outdoor Lighting", of this chapter for additional development and
design regulations.
   E.   Additional References: Further reference, as applicable, is provided in
the City of Eloy, Building and Fire Codes, subdivision regulations, Floodplain
Management Ordinance, and Engineering Design Standards. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-
2018)
21-2-4: PUBLIC FACILITIES DISTRICT:
21-2-4.1: GENERAL PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Public Facilities (PF) District is to provide appropriate
areas for buildings and facilities that are owned and operated by Federal,
State, regional, County and/or City governments, public/semi-public utilities,
special districts, or nonprofit/nongovernmental organizations which are used to
provide governmental public and/or semi-public related services. This zone is
also appropriate for educational sites, and cultural facilities. The Public
Facilities District is reserved for the construction, use and occupancy of
governmental, non- profit/nongovernmental public utility, cultural and
educational buildings and facilities, and other uses compatible with and
support the character of the district. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-4.2: PUBLIC FACILITIES USE STANDARDS:
The "tables of allowed uses" for Residential, Commercial and Industrial
Districts (section
21-2-2.3, table 2.2-1, section
21-2-3.3, table 2.3-1 and section
21-2-5.3, table 2.5-1 of this article), lists public facility, public and
quasi-public uses and indicates whether they are permitted by right or with
approval of a conditional use permit (CUP), or prohibited within each zoning
district. These use tables also include references to additional supplemental
use standards that may be applicable to that use. The organization headings and
individual abbreviations utilized in the tables are identified as follows:
   A.   Use Category: The "use categories" are intended to provide a quick
reference to organize the specific uses. These categories are not regulatory.
   B.   Specific Use Type: The "specific use types" are regulatory and function
as the basis for listing the existing and future land uses that are considered
in each zoning district. Rather than list every possible individual land use
type, this list classifies individual land uses and activities into specific
use types based on common functional, product or physical characteristics; such
as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, and how
goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The definition of
each specific use type is located in section
21-9-1, "Definitions", of this chapter.
   C.   Permitted Uses (P): A "P" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
by right in that zoning district.
   D.   Conditional Uses (C): A "C" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
with a conditional use permit in the respective zoning district. Conditional
use permits must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of
section
 21-6-7 of this chapter.
   E.   Not Permitted (NP): An "NP" in a cell indicates that the use is
prohibited in the respective zoning district.
   F.   Use-Specific Standards: Section numbers listed in the "Supplemental Use
Regulations" column denote the location of additional regulations that are
applicable to the specific use type; however, provisions in other sections of
this chapter may also apply.
   G.   Non-Specified Uses: When a use cannot be reasonably classified into a
specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple specific use types, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most
appropriate specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics
of the individual use or activity (including but not limited to size, scale,
operating characteristics and external impacts) in relationship to the specific
use type definitions provided in section
21-9-1 of this chapter. Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision may be
filed with the Community Development Department and heard by the Board of
Adjustment in conformance with the procedures of section
21-6-2.11 of this chapter. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-4.3: PUBLIC FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Public facility oriented uses and/or structures are permissible in
Residential, Commercial or Industrial Zoning Districts. As such, development
standards for most public facility uses will utilize the principal uses and
structures identified for Residential Districts (section
21-2-2.4,
Table 21-2-2.4.B. of this article), Commercial Districts (section
21-2-3.4,
Table 21-2-3.4.B. of this article) or Industrial Districts (section
21-2-5.4, table 2.5-2 of this article) except as otherwise expressly stated in
this chapter. Additional public facility development standards are found in
Table 21-2-4.3.B. of this section.
   B.   The provisions of Article IV. General Development Regulations shall
apply to property zoned a Public Facilities District (PF).

21-2-4.4: PUBLIC FACILITIES DESIGN GUIDELINES:
   A.   Landscaping And Walls: Landscaping and walls for all public facility
uses shall conform to the residential and non- residential requirements
provided in article IV of this chapter.
   B.   Off-Street Parking: Off-street parking for public facilities shall
comply with the standards contained in article IV of this chapter.
   C.   Signs: Signage for public facilities shall comply with the standards
contained in article IV of this chapter. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-5: INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS:
21-2-5.1: GENERAL PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Industrial Zoning Districts is to provide areas that promote
employment opportunities for existing and future residents of the City and
surrounding communities, while also separating these districts from future and/
or established residential and commercial areas from their potential direct and
indirect operational influences. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-5.2: INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS ENUMERATED:
   A.   Business Park (BP): The purpose of this Industrial District is to
provide sites for a range of research, technology and business park uses,
including office and administrative uses, designed to be conducted such that
these and storage operations are contained entirely within enclosed buildings.
Light manufacturing uses that complement the business park or research park use
that do not exhibit nuisances may be permitted if pertinent to the primary use.
This district encourages the development of attractive buildings in a campus
type setting on well-landscaped sites which may be adjacent to residential
areas.
   B.   Light Industrial (I-1): The purpose of this Industrial Zoning District
is to provide for a mix of assembly and non-intensive manufacturing and office
park uses. Such uses are located in an attractive, planned development setting
with proper screening and landscaping; all compatible with adjacent uses. It is
intended that this district allow for employment growth through the
establishment of high quality, planned industrial centers for corporate offices
and indoor manufacturing and well screened storage uses.
   C.   General Industrial (I-2): The purpose of this Industrial Zoning
District is to provide areas where heavy and concentrated fabrication,
manufacturing, and processing uses are appropriately screened and landscaped.
It is intended that this district provide adequate space for industrial
operations and related activities so that the economic base of the City may be
strengthened and employment opportunities expanded while protecting residential
and commercial land uses from objectionable encroachments. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-
2018)
21-2-5.3: INDUSTRIAL USE STANDARDS:
Table 2.5-1, "Table Of Allowed Uses For Business, Industrial And Public
Facility Districts", of this section, lists land uses and indicates whether
they are permitted by right or with approval of a conditional use permit (CUP),
or prohibited within each zoning district. The use table also includes
references to additional use-specific standards that may be applicable to that
use. The organization headings and individual abbreviations utilized in the
table are identified as follows:
   A.   Use Category: The "use category" is intended to provide a quick
reference to organize the specific uses. Such category is not regulatory.
   B.   Specific Use Type: The "specific use type" is regulatory and functions
as the basis for listing the existing and future land uses that are considered
in each zoning district. Rather than list every possible individual land use
type, this list classifies individual land uses and activities into specific
use types based on common functional, product or physical characteristics; such
as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, and how
goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The definition of
each specific use type is located in section
21-9-1, "Definitions", of this chapter.
   C.   Permitted Uses (P): A "P" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
by right in that zoning district.
   D.   Conditional Uses (C): A "C" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
with a conditional use permit in the respective zoning district. Conditional
use permits must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of
section
21-6-7 of this chapter.
   E.   Not Permitted (NP): An "NP" in a cell indicates that the use is
prohibited in that zoning district.
   F.   Use-Specific Standards: Section numbers listed in the "Supplemental Use
Regulations" column denote the location of additional regulations that are
applicable to the specific use type; however, provisions in other sections of
this chapter may also apply.
   G.   Non-Specified Uses: When a use cannot be reasonably classified into a
specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple specific use types, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most
appropriate specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics
of the individual use or activity (including but not limited to size, scale,
operating characteristics and external impacts) in relationship to the specific
use type definitions provided in section
21-9-1 of this chapter. Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision may be
filed with the Community Development Department and heard by the Board of
Adjustment in conformance with the procedures of section

(Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018; Ord. 24-981, 10-14-2024, eff 11-14-2024)
21-2-5.5: INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES:
The industrial design requirements and guidelines contained in this section
have been established to: recognize the unique needs and characteristics of
development in business and industrial use settings; protect and promote long-
term economic vitality through the promotion of high quality development; and
minimize adverse impacts to existing neighborhoods and anticipated residential
growth areas.
   A.   Applicability: These requirements and guidelines shall apply to
development of new buildings or renovation of existing buildings within any
Business and Industrial Zoning District, unless otherwise specified within this
section.
   These requirements and guidelines will be used by City staff and the
Planning and Zoning Commission as a framework for evaluating development
proposals and for commenting on the design aspects of those proposed projects.
The Eloy subdivision regulations should also be referenced for additional site
design standards specifically applicable to commercial subdivision
developments.
   B.   Architectural Guidelines:
      1.   Natural materials and deep earth tone colors are preferred, and
design elements should not primarily consist of metal, glass, plastic, highly
reflective materials and bright colors. Such materials may have limited
application in trim or accent areas, but should not be predominant visual
elements of the building(s) or site improvements.
      2.   Large, bland monolithic facades or rooflines and repetition of very
simple details foster a monotonous character, which should be avoided. Building
elevations should create a unique character which is emphasized through
interesting architectural details or relief in each component. For example,
windows may be arched or rectangular, bayed out or be recessed, have raised
borders, awnings, planter boxes or shutters.
      3.   All building facades should be designed with architecturally
finished materials, with primary building materials limited to the following:
         a.   Modular masonry materials such as brick, block, and stone.
         b.   Precast concrete or aggregate panels with a decorative finish.
         c.   Stucco or stucco-like materials.
         d.   Wood, provided the surfaces are finished for exterior use and
wood of proven exterior durability.
         e.   Other materials as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      4.   The following building types and materials are discouraged:
         a.   Galvanized or unfinished steel, galvalume or unfinished aluminum
buildings (walls or roofs), unless the roadway facing the facade of the
building is specifically intended to have a corrosive designed finish such as
Cor-Ten steel or is finished with a material that is compliant with subsection
B3 of this section.
         b.   Exposed, untextured, uncolored, unaugmented concrete.
   C.   Site Design/Orientation Requirements:
      1.   Buildings, structures, open space areas and other features shall be
oriented to protect and/or enhance major vistas and panoramas that accentuate
mountain vistas, and/or special man-made or natural landmarks.
      2.   On-site pedestrian walks shall be provided to connect street
sidewalks to primary commercial and mixed-use building entries by the most
direct route practicable. Multi-building developments shall minimize auto/
pedestrian conflicts and maximize convenient pedestrian access between
buildings.
      3.   Openings for vehicular uses, such as garage door bays used to access
vehicles into and out of a building for repair or storage, must be located on
facades that do not face the primary street.
   D.   Circulation Requirements:
      1.   Developments along ADOT controlled roadways shall complete a traffic
study analysis, including access needs, traffic control needs, highway
expansion needs, drainage management plan, and/or a cost sharing plan. ADOT
approval will be required as part of the development plan approval process.
      2.   Access points along primary gateway roadways shall be placed and
designed in accordance with ADOT and/or City requirements.
   E.   Properties With Frontage Along Primary Gateway Roadway Corridors:
Development of new buildings or renovation of existing buildings within any
Industrial Zoning District that is adjacent to Interstate 10, Frontier Street,
State Route 87, Sunland Gin Road, Toltec Road and Sunshine Boulevard, and
Battaglia Road, in the City of Eloy shall adhere to the following requirements:
      1.   Prohibited Uses: The following uses are prohibited within any
Business Park (BP), Light Industrial (I-1) or Heavy Industrial (I-2) Zoning
District that is located adjacent to the right-of-way of Interstate 10,
Frontier Street, State Route 87, Sunland Gin Road, Toltec Road, and Sunshine
Boulevard, and Battaglia Road:
         a.   Adult oriented businesses;
         b.   Auto wrecking and salvage yard;
         c.   Heavy rental, outdoor;
         d.   Waste facility, landfill;
         e.   Non-chartered financial institutions. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018;
Ord. 20-891, 1-27-2020)
21-2-5.6: ADDITIONAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Parking And Loading Requirements: See section
21-4-1, "Off- Street Parking And Loading", of this chapter for additional
development and design regulations.
   B.   Landscaping And Screening Requirements: See section
21-4-2 of this chapter for additional development and design regulations
relating to fencing, screening and landscaping.
   C.   Signage Requirements: See section
21-4-3, "Signage", of this chapter for additional development and design
regulations.
   D.   Outdoor Lighting Requirements: See section
21-4-5, "Outdoor Lighting", of this chapter for additional development and
design regulations.
   E.   Additional References: Further reference, as appropriate, is provided
in the City of Eloy, Building and Fire Codes, subdivision regulations,
Floodplain Management Ordinance, and Engineering Design Standards. (Ord. 18-
880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-6: OPEN SPACE DISTRICTS:
21-2-6.1: GENERAL PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Open Space Zoning Districts is to identify lands that are to
remain in their natural state, under agricultural production or developed to
emulate a natural or designed state for passive and active recreational
pursuits. The primary purpose of designating these areas is to raise the degree
of assurance that designated open space for conservation and recreational areas
will remain open in perpetuity, as well as to achieve the open space related
goals and objectives of the Eloy General Plan. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-6.2: OPEN SPACE DISTRICTS ENUMERATED:
   A.   Open Space Conservation District (OSC): The purpose of this Open Space
Zoning District is to protect and conserve natural area and agricultural/farm/
ranch lands in perpetuity. Such natural areas may include desert washes,
hillsides, floodplains, wildlife habitat, and lands identified to be retained
in their undeveloped state or designed open space state. Areas to be retained
in their agricultural state contain high value farmland that the property owner
agrees to maintain in perpetuity.
   B.   Open Space Recreation District (OSR): The purpose of this Open Space
Zoning District is to provide for active and passive recreation uses that are
to be integrated within the existing and future developed area of the City.
Such active and passive recreation uses include, but not limited to, public and
private parks, trail corridors, regraded and revegetated passive areas, joint
use recreation-detention/retention drainage facilities, etc., as designated on
a site plan, final plat or planned area development that will not contain any
non-recreational structural improvements in perpetuity. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-

21-2-7: OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS:
21-2-7.1: PLANNED AREA DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY (PAD):
21-2-7.2: GENERAL PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Planned Area Development (PAD) Overlay Zoning District is to
allow both the City and an applicant enhanced flexibility in the application of
development standards in exchange for a more creative approach to land planning
and building design that could not otherwise be achieved through strict
adherence to the terms of this chapter. The intent is to encourage innovative
design and to allow for a creative land use mix that will promote a high-
quality development reflective of the unique character and setting of the City
of Eloy, while achieving the following goals:
   A.   To encourage the City's development growth while enhancing the public
health, safety, and general welfare;
   B.   To encourage innovations in residential, commercial, and industrial
development to assist in expanding opportunities for diverse choices of
housing, recreation, shopping and employment to Eloy residents, workers and
visitors;
   C.   To reflect enhanced community sustainability and economic health in the
design and construction of future development;
   D.   To encourage a more creative and compact approach in the utilization of
land and resources in order to accomplish a more efficient, aesthetic, and
sustainable development which may be characterized by special features of the
geography, topography, size or shape of a particular property; and
   E.   To provide a compatible and stable developed environment, in harmony
with the Sonoran Desert.
PADs may be approved pursuant to the procedure and approval criteria identified
in section
 21-6-6, "Amendments To Zoning Map (Rezone)", of this chapter. (Ord. 18-880, 7-
23-2018)
21-2-7.3: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   The Planned Area Development District shall conform to the Eloy General
Plan as adopted or amended from time to time, shall conform to all regulations
pertaining to land development within this chapter and the subdivision
regulations, and all other rules, regulations, specifications and standards set
forth in all other applicable City codes, unless specific deviations are
approved by the City Council during the PAD approval process.
   B.   The minimum land area for a PAD Overlay shall be forty (40) acres and
shall be identified as one common ownership by the Pinal County Assessor.
Waiver of the forty (40) acre minimum requirement may be recommended by the
Community Development Director upon a finding that the waiver would be in the
public interest and that one or more of the following conditions exist:
      1.   Unusual physical features of the subject property or of the
surrounding area exhibit conditions/features that preclude the standard
provisions of this chapter being achieved;
      2.   The property is adjacent to, or across the street or alley from,
property which has been developed under the provisions of this section and will
contribute to the character and successfully integrate with the existing
development of the adjacent and proximate area;
      3.   The use of the PAD Overlay concept will encourage the use of
otherwise undevelopable parcels surrounded or partially surrounded by developed
property.
   C.   All PAD Overlay Zoning District projects shall provide a minimum of
fifteen percent (15%) of the net subject property acreage as Open Space
Conservation (OSC) and/or Open Space Recreation (OSR) regardless of the
proposed development intensity and/or density. Not more than fifty percent
(50%) of the required open space shall be attributed to golf course use or
ancillary golf uses. The City Council may require the formation of a
homeowners' association to assure that the City will not be responsible for the
maintenance of part or all of the identified open space. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-
2018)
21-2-7.4: STANDARDS ELIGIBLE FOR MODIFICATION:
Unless otherwise expressly modified as part of the PAD approval process, PADs
shall utilize the base (underlying) zoning districts and all applicable
standards established in this chapter. The City Council is authorized to
approve PADs that deviate from strict compliance with specified standards if
they determine that the resulting development satisfies the approval criteria
of section
21-2-7.5 of this section
21-2-7. The PAD standards may be more or less restrictive than those standards
identified in this chapter. PAD zoning may be used to:
   A.   Define and condition land uses permitted within each district,
including expanding or restricting uses permitted by right or by conditional
use permit within a base zoning district. PAD zoning may specify the location
of land uses and define standards for operation and performance of land uses.
   B.   Define development standards pertaining to the size, dimensions,
height, lot coverage, placement, or setback of uses. However, the total number
of dwelling units in a PAD Plan shall not exceed the maximum number permitted
by the General Plan density for the total area of the PAD designated for
residential and/or mixed-uses.
   C.   Specify the location, extent, and design standards for open space,
landscaping, amenities, screening and buffers, and signage.
   D.   Specify the location and design of public/private streets, drives,
parking, pedestrian, and bikeway circulation components.
   E.   Specify the timing, sequencing, and phasing of development, including
coordinating the type, location, and intensity of development permitted with
the construction and availability of public/private facilities and services.
   F.   Provide for the construction of public/private improvements and
facilities onsite or within public easements and rights-of- way abutting the
site as required to serve and benefit development within the PAD area or as may
be required to mitigate impacts resulting from the development on other
properties and uses adjacent to and/or proximate to the PAD area. (Ord. 18-880,
7-23-2018)
21-2-7.5: APPROVAL CRITERIA:
A PAD District may be approved only when the City Council determines that the
proposed PAD would result in a greater benefit to the City as a whole than
would development under conventional zoning district regulations and would not
adversely affect the existing and/or future permissible uses of adjacent
properties. Such greater benefit may include implementation of adopted planning
policies/design standards, natural resource preservation/conservation, enhanced
provision of utilities, urban design, neighborhood/community amenities or an
overall level of increased development quality. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-2-7.6: MANUFACTURED HOME OVERLAY DISTRICTS:
The purpose of the Manufactured Home Overlay Districts is to provide for
overlay zones that will permit the placement, and regulate the permanent or
periodic installation of, manufactured homes, tiny homes or recreational
vehicles for occupancy as single-family residential dwellings on individual
lots or within an approved land lease development. The intent of these
provisions is to provide attainable, adequate and diversified housing
opportunities within the City of Eloy while establishing and maintaining
appropriate development standards.
There are four (4) Manufactured Home Overlay Districts: Manufactured Home
Subdivisions, Manufactured Home Parks, Tiny House Parks and Recreational
Vehicle Parks.
   A.   Manufactured Home Subdivision (MHS):
      1.   The purpose of this overlay district is to provide an alternative
single-family living choice for those residents who choose a manufactured home
and/or park model environment. Development in this district consists of
subdivisions where residents own the lot upon which the home is situated. The

may be made of land or water within any zone established by this overlay
district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the Eloy Municipal Airport
and the aircraft, make it difficult for pilots using the airport, impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or
otherwise materially endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Examples of incompatible
development/activities includes, but are not limited to: buildings with
reflective glass or any type of reflective/glare producing exterior, high
intensity recreation type lights (especially on tall poles), smoke, antennas,
landfills/garbage dumps/incinerators, high tension transmission lines, large
bodies of standing water, etc.
   B.   The overlay geometry established herein are based on the maps or
illustrations in the “Eloy Airport Master Plan”, approved by the Eloy City
Council July 25, 2011. Amendments thereto as may from time to time be made, and
all notations, references, and other information thereon, shall be and the same

specific criterion and conditions to ensure that, if permitted, these land uses
will not detract from the health, safety, and general welfare of the City. The
criterion and conditions specified herein are in addition to those specified in
the underlying zoning district. In the event of conflict between these

   G.   Development Conditions of Approval: The following minimum conditions of
approval shall be imposed on every utility scale solar generation and
associated BESS project.
      1.   Pre and Post Construction Property Maintenance: A Site Maintenance
Agreement shall be mutually executed between the Property Owner or the Property
Owner's designee and the City (as a condition of approval) to ensure that all
undeveloped portions of the subject property shall be maintained in a natural,
debris-free, and weed-free condition. Subsequent to the construction of the
solar arrays, native low growing vegetation shall be used to stabilize the site
for the duration of the facility's use. Weed control or mowing shall be
performed routinely and a performance bond reflecting the costs of such
maintenance for a period of six (6) months shall be posted and maintained by
the Property Owner or the Property Owner's designee. Solar panels shall be
repaired or replaced or removed when they are either nonfunctional or in
visible disrepair. Persistent failure, over a period of six (6) months, to
maintain the site or its improvements may result in revocation of the
conditional use permit or planned area development entitlements and initiate
the facility's decommissioning by the City of Eloy.
      Prior to revoking a conditional use permit or zoning, and prior to
initiating a partial or complete decommissioning of any project, the City must
provide the Property Owner or the Property Owner's designee with official
notice of the City's intent to revoke via certified mail. The notice shall
identify each specific reason for the commencement of the revocation or
decommissioning process and shall provide the Property Owner or the Property
Owner's designee with thirty (30) calendar days to remedy the issue identified
in the notice. If the remedy requires more than thirty (30) calendar days to
complete, the Property Owner or the Property Owner's designee shall, within the
thirty (30) calendar day period, respond and inform the City, identifying the
scope of work and requesting a reasonable timeframe to remedy the identified
issue(s). The City and Property Owner or the Property Owner's designee shall
mutually determine the appropriate timeframe to completely resolve the issue
(s). In the event that thirty (30) calendar days pass and the issues have not
been completely resolved nor has the City received any written correspondence
from the Property Owner or the Property Owner's designee the City may place the
item on a City Council Agenda to allow public comment and input from the
Property Owner or Property Owner's designee prior to considering a revocation
of the conditional use permit (or other entitlement on the property),
commencing decommissioning of the project, or providing the Property Owner or
Property Owner's designee additional time to remedy the issue(s). The specific
process for this revocation procedure shall be set out in the Site Maintenance
Agreement and the revocation and decommissioning process described herein can
only be pursued for allegations related to violations of the Site Maintenance
Agreement and/or the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC)
      2.   Perimeter Landscape Treatment: The property owner/developer shall
coordinate with City Staff to select appropriate drought tolerant landscape
vegetation (from the Pinal AMA Low Water Use Plant List prepared by the Arizona
Department of Water Resources) to be located in a minimum ten (10) foot
landscape setback along all minor and major arterial frontages of the project.
The landscape setback along Sunland Gin Road, Toltec Road, Sunshine Boulevard,
Phillips Road, Harmon Road, and Pretzer Road shall be a minimum of thirty feet
(30'). Unless otherwise agreed to by the Zoning Administrator, all landscape
areas are to be initially served with a drip irrigation and water tank storage
system and irrigated on a regularly scheduled basis to promote vigorous
vegetative health and growth. If municipal water service is extended to within
four hundred (400) feet of the project boundary, the irrigation system shall be
retroactively extended, connected and activated for use. Landscaping and
irrigation systems shall be maintained throughout the life of the project by
the developer.
      3.   Utility Scale Solar Generation Perimeter Security: The entire
perimeter of the subject utility scale solar generation facility shall be
enclosed, at a minimum with a chain link fence, powder coated sage green, and
erected to a height of seven (7) feet as measured from the finish grade of the
land prior to the commencement of operations of the utility scale solar
generation facility. The fence shall be maintained in an upright and functional
condition pursuant to the executed Site Maintenance Agreement and the adopted
National Electric Code.
      4.   Lighting: Any on-site lighting provided for the operational phase of
the utility scale solar generation or BESS Facility shall comply with Section
21-4-5: Outdoor Lighting of the Eloy Zoning Code.

decommissioning rules and/or standards subsequent to the City's adoption of the
provisions below, the City reserves the right to review the adopted State rules
and/or regulations and to incorporate all, or portions thereof, through an
executed amendment of this ordinance.
      1.   Decommissioning Plan: The Applicant shall submit a decommissioning
plan to the City of Eloy for approval prior to, or in conjunction with, the

accordance with the decommissioning plan and these conditions. If the
decommissioning cost estimate includes any estimates or offsets for the resale
or salvage values of the utility scale solar generation facility, or BESS
equipment and materials, it shall be supported by an attached bid (dated within
six (6) months) from a third party vendor confirming their intent to buy and/or
salvage the identified solar generation components. The cost of preparing the
estimate shall be paid by the Applicant.
      3.   Decommissioning Cost Estimate Update: The applicant, or its
successor, shall cause the independent third-party Arizona licensed
professional engineer to update the decommissioning cost estimate every seven
(7) years. The cost of preparing this update shall be paid by the Applicant.

Guaranty: A letter of credit issued by a financial institution that has (i) a
credit rating of at least Baa3 or higher by Moody's or BBB- or higher by
Standard and Poor's; and financial ratios and capitalization requirements that
are acceptable to the City, in the full amount of the decommissioning estimate;
or
      2.   Tiered Securitization: An amount equal to, or more than, ten percent
(10%) of the approved decommissioning cost estimate to be deposited in a cash
escrow account at a financial institution acceptable to the City of Eloy; or an
amount equal to, or more than, ten (10) percent of the decommissioning cost
estimate in the form of a letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial
institution that has a credit rating of at least "A-" from Standard & Poor's or
A3 from Moody's and assets (50%) and capital surplus (50%) totaling at least
$10,000,000,000, or an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least "A-
(Excellent) or other credit rating and capitalization reasonably acceptable to
the City of Eloy, with the amount of the letter of credit or surety bond
increasing by an additional ten percent (10%) each year in years 2-9 after
commencement of operation of the utility scale solar generation facility.
      3.   Letter of Credit Adjustment: Following each revision of the
decommissioning cost estimate, the Applicant shall adjust the value of the
letter of credit to one hundred (100) percent of the then-current
decommissioning cost estimate.
      4.   Decommissioning Securitization Review: Upon the receipt of the first
revised decommissioning cost estimate (following the seventh (7th) year
anniversary), any increase or decrease in the decommissioning securitization
shall be funded by the applicant or refunded to the applicant (if permissible
by the form of security) within ninety (90) calendar days and will be similarly
readjusted for every subsequent seven (7)-year decommissioning cost estimate
update.
      5.   Receipt of Securitization Funds: The assurance must be received
prior to the approval of the building permit and must remain in full force for
the duration of the life span of the utility scale solar generation facility
and until all decommissioning is completed to the satisfaction of the City of
Eloy. If the City receives notice or reasonably believes that any form of
assurance has been revoked, or the City receives notice that any assurance may
be revoked, the City may, after providing notice and a reasonable opportunity
to post a replacement security, revoke the conditional use permit or planned
area development entitlement and shall be entitled to take all actions
necessary to obtain the rights to the securitized funds.
   J.   Applicant/Property Owner Obligation: Within six (6) months after the
complete cessation of use of the utility scale solar generation facility for
electrical power generation or transmission, the applicant or its successor, at
its sole cost and expense, shall initiate, and provide continuous,
decommissioning of the utility scale solar generation facility in accordance
with the mutually approved decommissioning plan. If the Applicant or its
successor fails to complete all decommissioning of the utility scale solar
generation facility, in accordance with the schedule provided in the mutually
approved decommissioning plan, the property owners shall immediately commence
decommissioning activities in accordance with the decommissioning plan.
Following the completion of decommissioning of the entire utility scale solar
generation facility and payment for such costs, arising out of a default by the
applicant or its successor, any remaining securitized funds held by the City
shall be distributed to the property owners(s) in the same percentage of the
securitized funds matched with the percentage of the property owner's acreage
ownership of the utility scale solar generation facility.
   K.   Applicant/Property Owner Default; Decommissioning by the City of Eloy:
If the Applicant, its successor, or the property owner(s) fail to decommission
the utility scale solar generation facility pursuant to the mutually approved
decommissioning plan and the City has not approved a repowering of the solar
generation facility, the City shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
commence decommissioning activities and shall have access to the property, and
shall have the right to draw on securitized funds up to the amount of the
actual decommissioning costs, and the rights to the utility scale solar
generation facility and BESS equipment and materials remaining on the property.
If applicable, any excess decommissioning securitized funds shall be returned
to the current owner of the property after the City has completed the
decommissioning activities and paid all outstanding invoices. Nothing herein
shall limit other rights or remedies that may be available to the City to
enforce the obligations of the Applicant, including under the City's zoning
powers.
      1.   Equipment/Building Removal: All physical improvements, materials,
and equipment related to solar energy generation, shall be removed from the
surface and the subsurface to a depth of forty-eight (48) inches. The pre-
existing soil grade will also be restored following disturbance caused in the
removal process. All perimeter fencing will be removed and recycled or reused.
Upon approval of the Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee, the existing
perimeter fencing may remain in place.
      2.   Infrastructure Removal: All access roads located within private
property will be removed. The exception to removal of the access roads and
associated culverts or their related material would be based upon written
request from the current or future landowner to allow all, or a portion of
these facilities to remain in place for use by that landowner.
      3.   Partial Decommissioning: If decommissioning is triggered for a
portion, but not the entire utility scale solar generation facility, then the
applicant or its successor will commence and complete decommissioning, in
accordance with the decommissioning plan, for the applicable portion of the
utility scale solar generation facility; the remaining portion of the utility
scale solar generation facility would continue to be subject to the
decommissioning plan.

21-4-1: OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING:
21-4-1.1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this section
21-4-1 is to establish minimum standards for the provisions of adequate off-
street parking and loading and maneuvering spaces for the uses permitted by
this chapter. The regulations for off street parking and loading have the
following specific objectives:
   A.   To provide off-street parking that is safe, efficient, convenient and
visually attractive.
   B.   To foster adequate ingress and egress by motor vehicles, recreational
vehicles, boats and busses.
   C.   To apply these regulations to new construction and expansion of, or
changes to, existing uses permitted by this chapter. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-4-1.2: APPLICABILITY:
Every use and structure, including a change or expansion of a use or structure
shall provide accessory parking and loading areas as set forth below. Except
when specifically exempted, the requirements of this section
21-4-1 shall also apply to all parking lots that are the principal use on a
site.
   A.   New Buildings And Land Uses: Off-street parking and loading shall be
provided as required by this section
21-4-1 at the time any new building or structure is erected or any new land use
is established.
   B.   Expansion Of Existing Nonresidential Buildings: When the floor area of
an existing structure is increased, additional off-street parking and loading
shall be provided as required by this section
21-4-1 for the additional floor area only, provided that the existing parking
was legally established and has not been reduced. If the number of existing
parking and loading spaces is greater than the requirements for such use, the
number of spaces in excess of the prescribed minimum may be counted toward
meeting the parking and loading requirements for the addition or enlargement of
floor area.
   C.   Addition Of Use To Existing Nonresidential Buildings: When a new use
locates on a parcel with an existing use, all off-street parking shall be
provided to meet the total number of spaces required for the existing use and
the new use, unless the uses meet the requirements of subsection
21-4-1.6D, "Shared Parking", of this section
21-4-1 or alternative guidelines that are expressly allowed by other provisions
of this chapter.
   D.   Change In Use Of Existing Nonresidential Buildings: When a change in
use requires added off-street parking than the previous use, additional parking
and loading spaces shall be provided equivalent to the difference between the
number of spaces required by this section for the immediately previous use and
the total number of spaces required by the new use. A change in occupancy is
not considered a change in use unless the new occupant is in a different use
classification than the former occupant.
   E.   Alterations That Increase The Number Of Dwelling Units: The creation of
additional dwelling units, through the alteration of an existing building or
construction of an additional structure or structures, requires added off-
street parking, as required by this section, to serve the new dwelling units.
This requirement does not apply when sufficient off-street parking exists to
provide the number of spaces required for the existing and new dwelling units.
   F.   When Required: Off-street parking and loading facilities required by
this section shall be constructed or installed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for the uses that they serve. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-4-1.3: GENERAL PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS:
   A.   Parking And Loading Spaces To Be Permanent: Parking and loading spaces
shall be permanently available, marked and maintained in good repair/condition
for parking or loading purposes for the use they are intended to serve during
the life of the use.
   B.   Reduction In Parking Area: The owner or occupant of any building or use
subject to off-street parking requirements under this section shall not
discontinue or reduce any existing required parking without first having
established other parking spaces which meet all requirements of this section to
replace those being lost or except after proof that, by reason of reduction in
floor area, seating area or other factors, the proposed reduced area for off-
street parking or loading will conform to the requirements of this section.
(Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-4-1.4: RESTRICTION OF PARKING AREA USE:
Required off-street parking, circulation, and access areas shall be used
exclusively for the temporary parking and maneuvering of motorized, operative
vehicles. In all Non-Residential Zones, parking areas shall not be used for the
sale, lease, display, repair, or storage of vehicles, trailers, boats, campers,
mobile homes, merchandise, or equipment, or for any other use not authorized by
the provisions of this chapter. In all Residential Districts, parking shall be
restricted per section
21-4-1.11, "Special Parking Requirements For Residential Uses", of this section
21-4-1.
   A.   Located On Same Site: Parking and loading facilities shall be located
on the same site with the use the facilities serve or on a contiguous,
identically zoned lot that is incorporated into the development site. Off-site
parking facilities may be permitted subject to the requirements of subsection
21-4-1.6E, "Off-Site Parking", of this section
21-4-1.
   B.   Located Off-Street: All parking and loading facilities required by this
section shall be provided off-street and shall not be located within any public
right-of-way, sidewalk, alley, or parkway, unless expressly allowed by other
provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Surplus Parking: The provisions of this section shall also apply to
parking and loading facilities provided in excess to those required, unless
otherwise expressly stated in this chapter.
   D.   Surfacing And Maintenance: With the exception of required parking in
the RR-20, RR-5 and RR-2.5 Zoning Districts, all off- street parking shall be
paved with asphalt or concrete, and be graded and drained as approved by the
City Engineer and shall be maintained in good condition, free of weeds, dust,
trash and debris. Paving stones or similar equivalent may be approved by the
City Engineer for parking upon parcels in the RR-20, RR-5 and RR-2.5 Zoning
Districts. Asphalt surfaces shall, at a minimum, consist of four inches (4") of
ABC plus two inches (2") of bituminous wearing surface. In cases of certifiable
short term or temporary use, parking lot surfaces may be constructed to a
lesser standard if approved by the City Engineer during the development review
process. In the case of allowed temporary surfacing, the owner shall provide
written guarantees for the development of the parking area within these
guidelines with time lines and deadlines calling for the closure of the use, if
the deadlines are not met. Concrete surfaces may be substituted and shall, at a
minimum, be concrete four inches (4") thick with a strength of not less than
three thousand (3,000) pounds per square inch (psi). (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)

   A.   Multiple Uses: Unless otherwise specified, lots containing more than
one use shall provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of
the requirements for all activities.
   B.   Non-Specified Parking Requirements: It is recognized that specifying a
single parking requirement for some uses listed in table 4.1-1 of this section
is not always feasible due to the diversity and variation in land use
characteristics that can exist within that specific use type. For those uses
listed in table 4.1-1 of this section that do not have a specific parking
requirement identified, the Zoning Administrator shall determine a parking
requirement based upon the requirements for the most similar comparable land
use, the particular characteristics of the proposed land use, and any other
relevant data regarding parking demand. In order to make this determination,
the Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to submit a parking demand
study or other information, at the applicant's cost. The parking demand study
may include, but is not limited to, estimates of parking demand based on
recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other
acceptable sources as approved by the Zoning Administrator, and should include
other recent, reliable primary or secondary source data collected from uses or
combinations of uses that are the same as, or comparable with, the proposed
use.
   C.   Unspecified Uses: Where buildings are constructed without uses
specified (i.e., shell buildings), the use with the greatest parking
requirement among all uses specified for the zoning district where the site is
located shall be used to calculate off-street parking requirements.
   D.   Uses In The Downtown Core Overlay: The parking requirements for uses in
the Downtown Core Overlay Zoning District shall be one-half (1/2) of those
listed in table 4.1-1 of this section, with the exception of service stations,
grocery and supermarkets, laundries, and motels and hotels, each of which shall
meet all requirements listed in table 4.1-1 of this section.
   E.   Basis Of Calculation: When calculating the total number of parking
spaces required, any fraction exceeding one-half (0.5) shall be rounded up to
the nearest whole number.
   F.   Occupancy- Or Capacity-Based Standards: For the purpose of computing
parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants,
calculations must be based on the largest number of persons working on any
single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity,
whichever results in the greater number of spaces. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018;
Ord. 20-891, 1-27-2020)
21-4-1.6: ALTERNATIVE PARKING PROVISIONS:
Where conditions preclude the complete compliance of off-street parking spaces
required by section
21-4-1.5, table 4.1-1 of this section
21-4-1, the following alternative parking provisions may be available, subject
to Zoning Administrator approval:
   A.   Compact Spaces: Up to ten percent (10%) of the total number of required
parking spaces for non-residential uses may be designated as compact spaces
when clearly labeled.
   B.   On-Street Parking: On-street parking spaces located in the right-of-way
along the property line, between the lot lines of the site, may be counted to
satisfy the minimum off-street parking requirements for non-residential uses.
One on-street parking space may be substituted for each required off-street
space. These provisions only apply to street frontages where on- street parking
is allowed and provided. The parking space credit shall be determined at the
time of site plan approval by the Zoning Administrator.
   C.   Tandem Parking: Shall mean a space where one vehicle parks behind
another, so that one vehicle must be moved before the other can be accessed.
Accessible parking spaces shall not be used for tandem parking spaces. Tandem
parking shall be limited to a maximum of two (2) cars in depth and no less than
nine feet (9') wide and forty feet (40') long. Tandem parking stalls are only
allowed for:
      1.   Residential Uses: Tandem parking spaces shall be allowed for single-
family, duplex and townhome residential with spaces and access paved in
accordance with requirements of this chapter to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator.
      2.   Multifamily Residential Uses: Tandem parking spaces shall be allowed
for condominium and multifamily residential uses, subject to the following
conditions.
         a.   The tandem spaces shall be reserved for and assigned to dwelling
units which are required to have two (2) or more parking spaces.
         b.   Tandem spaces shall not be used for guest parking.
      3.   Nonresidential Uses: Tandem parking spaces shall not be allowed for
new, non-residential construction.
   D.   Shared Parking: The Zoning Administrator may approve shared parking
arrangements for developments or uses with different operating hours or
different peak business periods, if the shared parking complies with all of the
following standards:
      1.   Eligible Developments Or Uses: Shared parking arrangements shall
only be allowed for nonresidential uses with different hours of operation or
different peak business periods.
      2.   Location:
         a.   Shared parking facilities shall be located on the subject
property of the specified principal uses proposing to use shared facilities.
         b.   All shared parking facilities shall be located within six hundred
feet (600') from the subject site to the primary entrance of each principal
use. The distance of the off-street parking area to the principal uses shall be
measured along the shortest legal and acceptable pedestrian route. Acceptable
pedestrian routes are defined within subsection
 21-4-1.12G, "Pedestrian Safe Access", of this section
21-4-1.
      3.   Parking Study Required: Those proposing to use shared parking as a
means of satisfying off-street parking requirements shall submit a shared
parking study to City staff that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared
parking. At a minimum, the study must address the size and type of the proposed
development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking
turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that
will be sharing off-street parking spaces.
      4.   Design And Improvement Standards: All newly-constructed shared
parking facilities shall conform to the same standards of access,
configuration, landscaping, lighting, layout, location, and size as are
required by this article for off-street parking spaces.
      5.   Covenant Required: A City-approved covenant shall be recorded with
Pinal County that includes a description of the shared parking arrangement, a
requirement that all current and future tenants are notified of and shall
adhere to the same hours of operation and conditions of the shared parking
approval. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a
building permit and/or business license/renewal for any use to be served by the
off-site parking area. The Zoning Administrator may grant permission to
dissolve a shared parking agreement only if all required off-street parking
spaces will be provided, in accordance with sections
21-4-1.4 and
21-4-1.5 of this section
21-4-1.
   E.   Off-Site Parking: The Zoning Administrator may approve the location of
required off-site parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the
principal use is located if the off- site parking complies with all of the
following standards:
      1.   Ineligible Uses: Unless expressly permitted, off-site parking may
not be allowed for residential uses or other convenience- oriented uses.
      2.   Location:
         a.   Off-site parking may be allowed only in the Downtown Core, or
outside the Downtown Core upon issuance of a permit for a special event.
         b.   All off-site parking spaces shall be located within six hundred
feet (600') from the subject site to the primary entrance of the principal use,
unless a remote shuttle bus or valet parking service is provided. The distance
of the off-site parking area to the principal use shall be measured along the
shortest legal and acceptable pedestrian route. Acceptable pedestrian routes
are defined within subsection
21-4-1.12G of this section
21-4-1.
         c.   Required parking spaces for persons with disabilities may not be
located off-site.
      3.   Design And Improvement Standards: All newly-constructed off- site
parking spaces shall conform to the same standards of access, configuration,
landscaping, lighting, layout, location, and size as are required by this
article for off-street parking spaces.
      4.   Terms Of Off-Site Parking:
         a.   A City-approved covenant shall be recorded with Pinal County that
includes a description of the off-site parking, and a requirement that the
owner of the separated lot maintain the required parking for the life of the
use to which it is subject to such covenant.
         b.   The owner or operator of a business that uses approved off- site
property to satisfy the parking requirements of this chapter shall immediately
notify the Zoning Administrator of any change of ownership or use of the
property for which the spaces are required, and of any termination or default
of the agreement between the parties.
         c.   Should an agreement for required off-site parking expire or
otherwise terminate, the Zoning Administrator shall determine a reasonable time
in which one of the following shall occur:
(1) Substitute parking is provided that is acceptable to the City; or
(2) The size or capacity of the use is reduced in proportion to the parking
spaces reduced.
         d.   If the above conditions are not met in the timeframe identified,
the use for which the off-site parking was provided shall be considered
nonconforming and any and all approvals, including conditional use permits
shall be subject to revocation.
   F.   Electric Vehicle Charging Stations:
      1.   For each electric vehicle charging station provided, the minimum
number of required off-street parking spaces may be reduced by two (2). Each
charging station counts toward the minimum number of required parking spaces.

residential lots in the RR-20, RR-5, RR-2.5, R1-54, R1-43, R1-12, R1-6, R-2 and
R-3 Zoning Districts, unless expressly modified in the following provisions.
   A.   Access To Parking Areas And Parking Spaces:
      1.   All parking areas shall provide access to a public street by means
of a paved driveway that extends on-site to a point not less than twenty feet
(20') from the property line.
      2.   If an off-street parking area utilizes a publicly dedicated alley
for access to a public street, the alley shall be paved the full length of the
alley. The use of an alley for access to a multi-family, commercial or
industrial site opposite any Single- Family Detached Zoning District is
prohibited.
   B.   General Parking Design And Maintenance:
      1.   All parking areas shall be designed, constructed, and drained in
accordance with all applicable City ordinances and regulations.
      2.   Vehicles are prohibited from parking in the sight visibility
triangle. The visibility triangle is located at the intersection of two (2)
streets or the intersection of a street and a driveway. The visibility triangle
is present on all corner lots and is measured by extending the property lines
until they intersect. Each of the two (2) legs of the visibility triangle shall
measure thirty three feet (33') in length along the property line and/or
driveway and shall be connected by the third side of the triangle. No curb
cuts, driveways, maneuvering areas, and low growing landscaping shall be
permitted within the described triangular area.
      3.   All parking spaces shall be permanently marked. Circulation aisles,
approach lanes, and turning areas shall be clearly marked with directional
arrows and lines to ensure safe traffic movement.
      4.   All required off-street parking areas shall be maintained in a
debris-free, pothole-free, and excessive crack-free condition; as determined by
the Zoning Administrator.
   C.   Parking Circulation Design:
      1.   Drive aisles and maneuvering areas shall be designed to facilitate
the safe movement of vehicles without posing a danger to pedestrians or
impeding the function of the parking area.
      2.   Parking areas that accommodate ten (10) or more vehicles must
maintain continuous circulation patterns, with no dead-ends, and safe access to
public streets.
      3.   Ninety degree (90°) parking areas that accommodate less than ten
(10) vehicles and terminate in a dead-end shall provide a five foot (5')
maneuvering area for the width of the aisle to assist in turning movements.
      4.   All off-street parking areas shall be designed so as to provide
ingress and egress from a public street by the forward motion of the vehicle.
Required off-street parking spaces shall be accessible without backing into or
otherwise reentering a public right-of-way.
      5.   All off-street parking areas must have the necessary dimensions for
the on-site maneuvering of refuse and fire trucks. If off-site maneuvering is
necessary, a permanent, recorded cross-access easement must be filed with the
City of Eloy Community Development Department prior to issuance of a building
permit.
   D.   Shared Access:
      1.   Parking areas shall provide reasonable internal driveway
connectivity to adjacent parking areas, when requested by the City to promote
convenience, safety and efficient circulation. A cross access easement
guaranteeing the continued availability of the shared access driveway between
the properties and running with the land shall be recorded by the owners of the
abutting properties.
   E.   Curbing And Wheel Stops:
      1.   Continuous curbing at least six inches (6") high and six inches (6")
wide shall be provided around the perimeter of all parking and drive aisle
areas. Curbing located adjacent to stormwater facilities may contain curb cuts
to allow for necessary drainage.
      2.   To avoid conflicts or safety hazards, concrete wheel stops at least
four inches (4") high and six inches (6") wide shall be located at least two
feet (2') from any adjacent wall, pole, fence, property line, walkway,
sidewalk, landscape area or any other obstruction over four inches (4") in
height where parking is located, unless other provisions within this section
are met. The two foot (2') overhang area shall be measured from the front end
of the space to the rear of the wheel stop.
      3.   The curbs adjacent to walkways or sidewalks may be used as wheel
stops, allowing the car to extend into or overhang the sidewalk, only if a
sidewalk with a width of six feet (6') or greater is provided. Where such
overhang is used, the length of the parking space may be reduced by two feet
(2'). Under no circumstances shall vehicles be allowed to extend into or
overhang abutting right-of-way and/or private property.
      4.   The curbs around landscape areas and/or planters may be used as
wheel stops, allowing the car to overhang the landscape area, only if the
landscape area is a minimum of two feet (2') wide for single row parking or a
minimum of seven feet (7') wide for opposing parking rows. Where such overhang
is used, the length of the parking space may be reduced by two feet (2'). Any
plants or landscape materials within the two foot (2') overhang may not extend
more than two inches (2") above the six inch (6") curb. All sprinklers should
be placed outside of the bumper overhang or aligned with the parking space
stripe so they are out of range of car bumpers. Use of such bumper overhangs
reduces impervious surfaces and is encouraged. Under no circumstances shall
vehicles be allowed to extend into or overhang abutting right-of-way and/or
private property.

signage.
      2.   Individual Mounted Signs: Sign copy mounted as individual letters
and/or graphics against a wall, fascia, or parapet of a building or other
structure that has not been painted, textured, or otherwise altered to provide

background, the sign area shall be based on the sum of the individual areas of
the smallest geometric shape or combination of geometric shapes capable of
encompassing the perimeters of the individual elements comprising the sign.
      5.   One Sign With One Or More Sign Faces:
         a.   One Face: Area of the single face only;
         b.   Two Faces: If the interior angle between the two (2) faces is
forty five degrees (45°) or less, the sign area will be the total of one face
only; if the angle between the two (2) sign faces is greater than forty five
degrees (45°), the sign area will be the sum of the areas of the two (2) faces.

21-4-3.
   D.   Businesses having building frontage greater than two hundred feet
(200') in length may increase their allowed sign area by 0.5 square feet per
one lineal foot of building frontage in excess of two hundred feet (200'). Such
additional sign area shall be for the exclusive use of said business and not
transferable or reallocable to other businesses on the parcel.
   E.   Building frontage is determined by the measurement of the portion of
the business facing the street or public access driveway or public alley.

21-4-4: WIRELESS FACILITIES/APPLICABILITY:
21-4-4.1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this section
21-4-4 is to establish general guidelines for the installation of wireless
facilities, including towers and antennas. The regulations for wireless
facilities have the following specific objectives:
   A.   To establish uniform standards and procedures to manage the
development, siting, installation, and operation of wireless facilities in
compliance with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996;
   B.   To minimize the adverse visual effects of wireless facilities through
careful design, siting, and screening, while preserving the rights of wireless
telecommunications providers;
   C.   To strongly encourage the joint use (co-location) of new and existing
wireless facility sites as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers;
   D.   To allow appropriate development of wireless facilities to provide
services within the City in a manner that will protect and promote public
health and safety, preserve the City's residential character and uncluttered
appearance and prevent visual blight;
   E.   To apply these provisions to all new wireless facilities and the
expansion and/or alteration of any existing wireless facility;
   F.   To encourage users of wireless facilities to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through
careful design, siting, screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques.
(Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-4-4.2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Wireless Facilities, Freestanding: All new wireless freestanding
structures (or support structures), including a monopole, tower (guyed or

(Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018; Ord. 19-888, 10-14-2019)
21-4-4.4: DESIGN STANDARDS:
Wireless facilities, antennas, antenna support structures, and related
equipment shall be located, designed, and screened to integrate and complement
the existing natural or built surroundings and existing supporting structures.
   A.   Design And Visibility: All wireless facilities shall be designed and
located to minimize their visibility to the greatest extent feasible. All
wireless facilities proposed for locations where they would be readily visible
from adjacent property and public right-of-way (measured from the center of the
tower location) shall incorporate appropriate camouflage "stealth" techniques
to disguise the facility and/or blend into the surrounding environment, to the
extent feasible. Said camouflage techniques commonly include, but are not
limited to; "mono- palms", "mono-pines", "flag pole", "water-tower" or "clock
tower" designs, wireless facilities shall be compatible in scale and integrated
architecturally with the design of surrounding buildings or the natural
setting.
   B.   Screening: Antenna support equipment for freestanding wireless
facilities shall be screened by a maximum eight foot (8') masonry wall (i.e.,
smooth face with stucco finish or split face) or placed within a fully enclosed
building. When placed within a fully enclosed building, the building design
shall be no taller than one story or fifteen feet (15') in height with
elevations designed and constructed in a manner compatible with regionally
contextual architecture. When both a masonry wall and enclosure are required,
the two (2) elements should be designed to integrate together in complementary
design featuring at least one face of the building facade.
   C.   Freestanding Antenna(s):
      1.   Antenna facilities that are not camouflaged or stealth sited shall
be close mount, to the extent possible.
      2.   Stealth or camouflaged facilities shall not have antenna mounts that
extend beyond the outside edge (array) of the materials used to provide the
stealth or camouflage design.
      3.   Freestanding wireless facilities shall be painted or treated to
minimize the contrast of the tower against the horizon. At a tower site, the
design of the buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors,
textures, screening and landscaping that will integrate the built structures
into the natural setting.
      4.   Wireless facility support structures and antennas shall be painted/
coated in a non-glossy color and/or exterior finish so as to visually connect
with surrounding properties.
   D.   Building Mounted Antenna(s) And Support Equipment:
      1.   If an antenna is installed on a building, the antenna and supporting
electrical and mechanical equipment must be architecturally integrated in a
manner that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color/texture of
the building structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unnoticeable as possible.
      2.   Roof-mounted or facade-mounted antennas proposed on an existing
building, or on a tower, pole, or other structure shall not extend or project
more than ten feet (10') above the existing height of the building or
structure.
   E.   Stealth Alternative Wireless Facility And Antenna(s):
      1.   When an alternative wireless facility or co-location does not exist
on a parcel adjacent to a residential use, stealth design shall be provided. A
stealth facility shall be designed and constructed to appear architecturally
integrated with the surrounding built environment or the natural setting to
minimize the adverse visual impact and ensure the facility is compatible with
the environment in which it is located. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-4-4.5: GENERAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Principal Or Accessory Use: Wireless facilities may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on such lot.
   B.   Inventory Of Existing Sites: Each applicant for a new wireless facility
shall provide to the Community Development Director an inventory of all
existing towers, antennas, or sites within two (2) miles of the proposed
location for wireless facility, that are either within the jurisdiction of the
City and/or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific
information about the location, height, and design of each wireless facility.
The Community Development Department shall maintain a map and database with the
above information available for public review and purchase. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to verify and update any information provided
by the City.
   C.   State Or Federal Requirements: All wireless facilities must meet or
exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other
agency of the State or Federal government with the authority to regulate
wireless facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section
21-4-4 shall bring such wireless facilities into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated
by the controlling State or Federal agency. Failure to bring wireless
facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the wireless facilities at the owner's
expense.
      1.   Freestanding wireless facilities are prohibited in the Eloy
Municipal Airport Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) designated by the FAA.
   D.   Lighting: Freestanding wireless facilities shall not be artificially
lit, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority, or as otherwise
approved by the Eloy City Council. If lighting is required for ground
equipment, a lighting plan shall be submitted in accordance with section
21-4-5 of this article.
   E.   Building Codes And Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity
of wireless facilities, the owner of a wireless facility shall ensure that it
is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable State or
local Building Codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published
by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) and by the Telecommunications
Industries Association (TIA), as amended from time to time. If, upon
inspection, the City concludes that a wireless facility fails to comply with
such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then
upon notice being provided to the owner of the wireless facility, the owner
shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such
standards, or as otherwise specified in writing by the building official.
Failure to bring such wireless facility into compliance within said thirty (30)
days, or as otherwise specified, shall constitute grounds for the removal of
the wireless facility or antenna at the owner's expense.
   F.   Measurement: For purposes of measurement, freestanding wireless
facility setbacks and separation distances shall be calculated and applied to
facilities located in the City irrespective of Municipal and County
jurisdictional boundaries. Distance separation requirements shall be measured
from the farthest extents of the tower site, including fence and/or base
equipment, to the nearest impacted property line.
   G.   Franchises: Owners and/or operators of wireless facilities shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the City have been obtained and
shall file a copy of all required franchises with the City.
   H.   Signs: No signs shall be allowed on a wireless facility or any portion
of the premises leased for wireless telecommunication use, except for a
permanent, weather-proof identification sign, approximately sixteen inches
(16") by thirty two inches (32") in size, must be placed on the gate of the
fence or wall surrounding the facility or, if there is no fence or wall, on the
facility itself. The sign must identify the facility operator(s), provide the
operator's address, and specify a 24-hour telephone number for reaching the
operator or an agent.
   I.   Co-Location And Multiple Antenna/Tower Plan: The City encourages
wireless facility users to submit a single application for approval of multiple
wireless facilities and/or antenna sites and to submit applications which
utilize co-location with an existing wireless telecommunications provider.
   J.   Modification Of Building Size Requirements: The requirements of this
section
21-4-4 may be modified by the City Council in the case of uses permitted by
conditional use to encourage co- location.
   K.   Site Security And Ground Equipment: Outdoor ground equipment, unless
placed in underground equipment shelters, shall be enclosed with a maximum
eight foot (8')-high masonry wall, shall be constructed of block or masonry,
and secured in a method as otherwise determined by the Community Development
Director. All lattice towers (or other structures deemed climbable) shall be
equipped with an anti-climbing device.
   L.   Landscaping: The following requirements shall govern the landscaping of
surrounding towers; provided, however, that the City Council may reduce or
waive such requirements, if the goals of this section
21-4-4 would be better served thereby.
      1.   Freestanding wireless facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer
of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the freestanding
wireless facility from residential property and commercial property or viewable
from the public right-of-way. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped
strip at least eight feet (8') wide outside the perimeter of the compound and
any other areas disturbed during construction.
      2.   Every twenty (20) lineal feet on center of the perimeter of the
enclosure of the building shall be landscaped with vegetation from the Pinal
Active Management Area (AMA) Low Water Use/Drought Tolerant Plant List at a
rate of one (1) 24-inch box tree and ten (10) 5-gallon size shrubs. All
landscaping shall be irrigated. The landscaping and irrigation system shall be
maintained throughout the life of the facility.
      3.   Additional landscaping may be required at the discretion of the
Community Development Director as needed to effectively blend applications with
the surrounding environment.
      4.   Existing mature plant growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
   M.   Parking And Access: A minimum of one (1) nine foot (9') by eighteen
foot (18') off street parking stall shall be required for the ongoing
maintenance of the facility. Parking and maneuvering areas shall be surfaced
with approved all weather treatment as determined by the City Engineer and to
meet public safety access requirements for connection to improved right-of-
way. The access surface is to be maintained by the tower operator/owner.
   N.   Noise: No permit (conditional or administrative use permit) shall be
issued for any facility which generates a noise level greater than fifty
decibels (50 dB) as measured at the edge of the property upon which such
facility is sited.
   O.   Term: In the event a building permit is not received within two (2)
years or as otherwise stipulated, or reasonable effort is not made to receive a
building permit as determined by the Community Development Director, the
administrative approval or conditional use permit shall expire. Each
administrative approval or conditional use permit issued shall be for a period
of five (5) years for freestanding wireless facility applications, and a period
of ten (10) years for building mounted antennas, alternative tower mounted
antennas, and stealth tower and antennas.
      1.   Expiration: At the end of the above specified term, the permit shall
automatically expire unless a written request for renewal is submitted by the
applicant, prior to expiration, and received by the Community Development
Director. The City shall notify the applicant in writing at least ninety (90)
days prior to the expiration date of the permit for the wireless facility. Upon
the expiration of any required permits for the wireless facility, it shall be
removed in accordance with the requirement of this section.
      2.   Renewal: If a request for renewal of the required permit(s) is
received, the permit shall remain in effect until a decision on the renewal is
made. The renewal request shall be reviewed in a similar manner as the original
approval.
The review is to ensure that the facility is still in operation; that it has
been properly maintained; that the original conditions of approval have been
adhered to and whether they are to remain the same or need to be modified; and
to determine if new technology exists to upgrade the facility to achieve the
purpose, intent, goals and provisions of this section
21-4-4. If new technology exists that will allow the redesign or relocation of
the facility to achieve the purpose, intent, goals and provisions of this
section
21-4-4, then the facility must be redesigned and/or relocated accordingly.
Failure to comply with this requirement may be considered grounds for denial of
a new permit.
   P.   Conditions Of Approval: The City may add conditions to any new permits
as necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest related to health,
safety, or welfare, provided, however, that any condition shall comply with
applicable FCC regulations and standards, and that reasonable advance notice
thereof has been provided to all affected parties.
   Q.   Decision To Deny: If a permit is not renewed, the City shall give the
applicant written notice thereof together with the rationale and evidence on
which the City's decision was made.
   R.   Support Structures:
      1.   Alternative Wireless Facility Building Element: A building used as a
support structure for a wireless facility shall not be inhabited in any manner.
      2.   Monopole: Any new monopole shall be constructed to allow for co-
location of at least one other similar wireless communication antenna. If
constructed to less than the maximum height permitted, the monopole shall have
the capability of having an additional vertical section added.
      3.   Alternative Wireless Facility Light Pole: When an alternative
wireless facility light pole replaces one of a group of light poles, its
dimensions and appearance shall replicate those of the existing light poles to
the maximum extent feasible.
      4.   Existing Vertical Element, Recreational Field Light Pole: When a
recreational field light pole replaces one of a group of light poles, its
dimensions and appearance shall replicate those of the existing light poles to
the maximum extent feasible.
   S.   Portable Monopoles:
      1.   Temporary Replacement Monopoles: A portable monopole is permitted
during the construction, modification, or replacement of an approved wireless

21-4-5: OUTDOOR LIGHTING:
21-4-5.1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this section
21-4-5 is to reduce excessive levels of light intensity so that it does not
interfere with the enjoyment of private property, cause safety hazards for
drivers and users of the public right-of-way or obstructs astronomical
observations in the area. The regulations for outdoor lighting have the
following specific objectives:
   A.   To establish procedures and standards that minimize light trespass and
light pollution.
   B.   To reduce glare and conserve energy by controlling the artificial
illuminating devices emitting rays into the night sky.
   C.   To preserve the low light level conditions that are inherently
characteristic of the rural lifestyle.
   D.   To allow only the quantity and level of lighting necessary for safety,
security and the enjoyment of private property. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-4-5.2: CONFORMANCE WITH APPLICABLE CODES:
   A.   All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be installed in conformance with
the provisions of this chapter and the applicable provisions of the Building
Codes, Electrical Codes and Sign Code requirements currently in effect in the
City of Eloy and under appropriate permit and inspection.
   B.   Where any provisions of the Arizona Revised Statutes, or any Federal
law, or any companion ordinance conflicts with the requirements of these
outdoor lighting provisions, the most restrictive shall govern. (Ord. 18-880,
7-23-2018)
21-4-5.3: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Existing Buildings And Uses: Any new outdoor lighting installed upon a
building or parcel, lot or tract of land shall meet the requirements of this
section
21-4-5 with regard to the pole height, lamp type and shielding requirements.
The total outdoor light output, after the new lights are installed, shall not
exceed that intensity of light that was emitted in a legally non-conforming
manner prior to the lighting component update or modification.
   B.   New Uses, Buildings, And Major Additions Or Modifications: The
requirements of this section
21-4-5 apply to any and all new and major additions to land uses, developments,
buildings, or structures.
      1.   Major Additions: If a major addition occurs on a property, the
entire property shall comply with the requirements of this section
21-4-5. For purposes of this section, the following are considered to be major
additions:
         a.   Additions of twenty five percent (25%) or more in terms of
additional dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or parking
spaces, either with a single addition or with cumulative additions subsequent
to the effective date of this section
21-4-5; and
         b.   Single or cumulative modification or replacement of outdoor
legally installed lighting fixtures constituting twenty five percent (25%) or
more of the lumens that would be permitted under this section
21-4-5 for the property, no matter the actual amount of lighting already on a
non-conforming site, constitutes a major addition for purposes of this section.
      2.   Minor Additions Or Modifications: Additions or modifications of less
than twenty five percent (25%) in terms of additional dwelling units, gross
floor area, seating capacity, or parking spaces to existing uses shall require
the submission of a complete inventory and site plan detailing all existing and
any proposed new or modified outdoor lighting. Any new or modified outdoor
lighting on the site shall meet the requirements of this section 21-4-5 with
regard to pole height, shielding and lamp type; the total amount of light
emitted (after the modifications are complete) shall not exceed that which was
emitted on the site before the modification, or that light intensity permitted
by this section
21-4-5, whichever is larger.
   C.   Change Of Use: Whenever the use of any existing building, structure or
premises is intensified through the incorporation of additional dwelling units,
gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement which create
a need for an increase in the total number of parking spaces of twenty five
percent (25%) or more (either with a single change or cumulative changes
subsequent to the effective date of this section
21-4-5) then all outdoor lighting shall be reviewed and brought into compliance
with the requirements of this section
21-4-5 before the use is resumed (to the maximum extent feasible) as determined
by the Zoning Administrator. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)

established in accordance with provisions of Chapter 2 Administration, Article
IV. Commissions, Boards and Bureaus, Division 2. Board of Adjustment of the

14-2024)
21-5-4.1: POWERS AND DUTIES:
   A.   The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties set
forth in Chapter 2 Administration, Article IV. Commissions, Boards and Bureaus,
Division 2. Board of Adjustment, and as follows:
      1.   Appeal of Zoning Administrator Decision: To hear and decide appeals
in which it is alleged that there is an error in an order, requirement or
decision made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter
and Chapter 15 Subdivisions. This power shall include the power to reverse,
affirm, or modify, wholly or partly, any order, requirement or decision of the
Zoning Administrator properly appealed to the Board, and make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as is necessary.
         a.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in the matter appealed from,
unless the person from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the
Board that the stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order granted by
the Board or by a court of record on application and notice to the person from
whom the appeal is taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the
appeal and give notice thereof.
      2.   Request for Variances: To hear and decide requests for variances
from the terms of this chapter. The Board of Adjustment may impose reasonable
conditions in a decision to approve a variance.
         a.   Justification for Variance: A variance from the terms of this
chapter may only be granted upon the presentation of evidence demonstrating
that the specific requirements established by State Statutes have been
satisfied:
            i.   There exist special circumstances or conditions regarding the
land or building for which the variance or adjustment is sought, which do not
apply generally to other land or buildings in the same zoning district; and
            ii.   The above special circumstances or conditions are preexisting
and are not created or self-imposed; and
            iii.   The variance is necessary for the preservation of
substantial property rights. Without a variance, the property cannot be used
for purposes otherwise allowed in the same zoning district and the variance or
adjustment, as granted, is the minimum adjustment that will accomplish this
purpose; and
            iv.   The granting of the adjustment will not be materially
detrimental to persons residing or working in the vicinity, to adjacent
property, or to the neighborhood or the public welfare.
         b.   Prohibited Actions: The Board of Adjustment may not:
            i.   Make any changes in the uses allowed in any zoning
classification or zoning district; or
            ii.   Make any changes in the terms of this chapter, provided the
restrictions in this paragraph shall not affect the authority to grant
variances pursuant to State Statutes.
      3.   Reasonable Accommodation for a Disability:
         a.   A Reasonable accommodation from a development standard of this
Chapter for a disability shall not be authorized unless the Board shall find
upon sufficient evidence all of the following:
            i.   The requested accommodation has been made by or on behalf of
one (1) or more individuals with a disability protected under federal and
Arizona fair housing laws (42 U.S.C. § 3600 et seq. and A.R.S. § 41-1491 et
seq.);
            ii.   The requested accommodation is necessary to afford an
individual with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling;
            iii.   The standard or requirement unduly restricts the opportunity
for a person with a disability from finding adequate housing within the City of
Eloy;
            iv.   The requested accommodation does not fundamentally alter the
nature and purpose of the City of Eloy Zoning Ordinance of the City of Eloy;
            v.   The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial
or administrative burden on the City, as “undue financial or administrative
burden” is defined in federal and Arizona fair housing laws (42 U.S.C. § 3600
et seq. and A.R.S. § 41-1491 et seq.) interpretive case law;
            vi.   The profitability or financial hardship of the owner/service
provider of a facility shall not be considered in determining whether to grant
a reasonable accommodation for a disability;
            vii.   The requested accommodation shall not, under the specific
facts of the application, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of
other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others; and
            viii.   The requested accommodation shall comply with all
applicable building and fire codes.
         b.   The Board of Adjustment may impose reasonable conditions in a
decision to approve a reasonable accommodation for a disability.

decision, file a complaint for special action in Superior Court to review the
Board’s decision.
      1.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in the matter appealed from
unless the person from whom the appeal is taken obtains relief from the
Superior Court, which has upon finding that such a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property. If relief is provided, the proceedings shall not be
stayed, unless by a restraining order granted by the Arizona Appellate Court of
record.

Administrator may authorize a partial refund based upon the costs incurred to-
date and determination of the status of the application at the time of the
withdrawal request.
         b.   Unless fees are waived by the Mayor and Eloy City Council.

comments to the applicant, if necessary. Upon receiving the applicant's final
response to review comments, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall prepare
a staff report. The staff report shall be made available for inspection and
copying by the applicant and the public prior to the scheduled public hearing
of the development application. The staff report shall indicate whether, in the

 21-6-2. Any decision within the authority of the decision-making body may be
appealed, unless this chapter identifies that the decision is final.
   A.   Applicability: The appropriate decision-making body for each appeal
type is identified in sections
21-6-4 through
21-6-12 of this article. General appeals in which it is alleged there is an
error in an order, requirement or decision made by the Zoning Administrator in
the enforcement of this chapter shall be made to the Board of Adjustment
pursuant to the provisions of this section.
   B.   Appeal Process:
      1.   Filing Of Appeal: Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be made by
persons aggrieved or by any City officer, department, board or bureau affected
by a decision of the Zoning Administrator. An appeal shall be filed with the
Community Development Department on a form established by the Director. Within
five (5) working days after the appeal is filed, the Zoning Administrator shall
transmit all records pertaining to the action appealed to the Board. The appeal
shall set forth the decision or decisions being appealed and the grounds upon
which the appeal is based. The appeal shall be accompanied by any applicable
fees.
      2.   Complaint For Special Action: A person aggrieved by a decision of
the legislative body or Board of Adjustment or a taxpayer who owns or leases
the adjacent property or a property within three hundred feet (300') from the
boundary of the immediately adjacent property, a City officer or a department
affected by a decision of the legislative body or board, may file a complaint
for special action in the Superior Court to review the Board of Adjustment
decision.
      3.   Appeal Period: All appeals shall be filed within fifteen (15)
calendar days of the decision, except for appeals from decisions of the Board
of Adjustment or City Council. An appeal from any decision regarding a City
Council or Board of Adjustment action (e.g., variances, text or map amendments)

If no appeal is filed in writing within the relevant fifteen- or thirty-day
protest period, the decision shall be considered final.

for appeals related to the Zoning Administrator's interpretation or enforcement
of this chapter, shall stay all proceedings in the matter appealed.
      5.   Appeals: Appeals made to the Board of Adjustment pertaining to the
Zoning Administrator's interpretation or enforcement of this chapter shall stay
all proceedings in the matter appealed, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board that, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion by the facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property. Upon such certification, proceedings shall not be stayed, except by
restraining order granted by the Board or by a court of record on application
and notice to the Zoning Administrator.
      6.   Court Proceedings: Filing a complaint in the Superior Court does not
stay proceedings on the decision sought to be reviewed, but the court may, on
application, grant a stay and, on final hearing, may affirm or reverse, in
whole or in part, or modify the decision reviewed.
      7.   Public Notice: Prior to consideration of any appeal for which State
law or this chapter requires a public hearing, the City shall provide public
notification in compliance with section
21-6-2.5, "Public Notice Requirements", of this section
21-6-2 or as required by State law, whichever requires the most notice.

making body shall use the same standards for decision- making required for the
original decision.
      9.   Hearing Body Action: Public hearings shall be conducted in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter, unless as may be otherwise
specified in this Code or as set forth in Arizona Revised Statutes. The
decision-making body for the appeal shall deny or grant the appeal or the
decision-making body may remand the matter to the original decision-making body
for reconsideration, for additional information or to cure a deficiency in the
record or proceeding. The decision-making body shall render its decision within
thirty (30) days of the date the hearing is closed unless State law requires a
shorter deadline. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-6-2.12: APPEALS OF DEDICATIONS OR EXACTIONS TO HEARING OFFICER:
   A.   Appeal To Hearing Officer: Any requirement of a dedication or exaction,
as a condition of granting approval for the use, improvement, or development of
real property may be appealed to a Hearing Officer appointed by the City
Council. This section shall not apply to legislatively imposed dedications or
exactions in which no discretion by the Zoning Administrator or administrative
officer to determine the nature or extent of the dedication or exaction was
exercised. In the event of such an appeal, the Zoning Administrator shall
prepare a takings impact report. No fee shall be charged for filing an appeal
under this section and such appeal shall be conducted as required by Arizona
Revised Statutes section 9-500.12.
   B.   Appeal Of Decision Of Zoning Hearing Officer: A property owner
aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Hearing Officer to modify or affirm a
dedication or exaction requirement or to affirm a zoning regulation may file,
within thirty (30) days after the decision, a complaint in Superior Court,

2018)
21-6-2.13: EFFECTIVE DATE AND EXERCISING APPROVAL AT RISK:
   A.   A final decision on an application for any discretionary approval
subject to appeal (e.g., a conditional use permit, variance, or site plan
approval) shall become effective after the expiration of the appeal period
following the date of action, unless an appeal is filed. No building permit or
business license shall be issued until the day following the expiration of the
appeal period, unless, in accordance with subsection B of this section, the
applicant signs a waiver explaining that they understand and accept the risk of
proceeding before the appeal period ends.
   B.   An approved conditional use permit or variance or an interpretation
favorable to the applicant may be exercised at the applicant's sole risk, and a
building permit (if required) may be issued subsequent to approval by the City
building official. However, if an appeal of the decision is filed in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter that reverses in whole or in part or
modifies the decision and that causes any construction or use commenced as a
result of exercising the decision to be in conflict with the appellate body's
decision, then such building permit may be revoked in accordance with the
appellate body's decision and any such construction or use may constitute a
violation of this chapter and may be subject to removal or cessation by the
applicant, property owner, or his agent. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)

limited to:
   A.   Whether the development pattern contained in the future land use plan
provides appropriate optional sites for the use proposed in the amendment.

General Plan and is not solely for the good or benefit of a particular
landowner or owners at a particular point in time.

whole or a portion of the City by:
      1.   Significantly altering acceptable existing land use patterns.

water systems than are needed to support the prevailing land uses in which,
therefore, may negatively impact development of other lands. The commission

improvements will be mitigated pursuant to binding commitments by the
applicant, a public agency, or other sources when the impacts of the uses
permitted pursuant to the General Plan amendment will be realized.

existing systems.
      4.   Affecting the livability of the surrounding area or the health and

Plan adoption that did not fully consider facts, projects or trends which could
reasonably exist in the future.

changed the character and/or condition of the area so as to make the
application acceptable.

the impacts identified in subsections A through G of this section. (Ord. 18-

21-6-9.1: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY:
Because of special circumstances applicable to a property, including its size,
shape, topography, location or surroundings, there may be instances in which
the strict application of this chapter will deprive the property of privileges
enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district. To ensure a fair
application of this chapter, a variance from the standards imposed may be
granted by the Board of Adjustment. In granting a variance:
   A.   Consideration may be afforded with respect to dimensional and
performance standards including, but not limited to site dimensions, yards,
height of structures, distances between structures, open space requirements,
signage dimensions, fences, and walls.
   B.   Nothing shall be construed to empower the Board to change the terms of
this chapter, to authorize uses which violate any other City ordinance, to
affect changes in the Zoning Map, to add to the uses permitted or adjust the
permitted density/intensity in any zoning district, or to grant a variance.
   C.   All sections of this chapter are considered binding unless relief is
granted through the variance process.
   D.   All approved variances shall be personal to the appellant and shall be
transferable and run with the land only after completion and final inspection
of any authorized structure. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)

requirements listed in section
21-6-9.3, "Required Findings", of this section
21-6-9;

section
21-6-2.5, "Public Notice Requirements", of this article.
   F.   Board Of Adjustment Review And Action: The Board of Adjustment shall

Adjustment may impose reasonable conditions necessary to:
         a.   Achieve the general purposes of this chapter or the specific
purposes of the zoning district in which the site is located, or to make it
consistent with the adopted Eloy General Plan;
         b.   Protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; or
         c.   Ensure operation and maintenance of the use in a manner
compatible with existing and potential uses on adjoining properties or in the

conditions or deny shall be communicated in writing to the applicant in
compliance with section
21-6-2.7 of this article. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-6-9.3: REQUIRED FINDINGS:
The Board of Adjustment shall only approve a variance after finding that all of
the following conditions are met. Financial hardship, personal preference of
the owner, or the fact that the property may be utilized more profitably if the
requested variance is granted shall not be considered grounds for approval.
   A.   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are unique to the
land, structure, or building involved, and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district.
   B.   A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the appellant of
rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district.
   C.   The alleged hardship caused by literal interpretation of the provisions
of this chapter includes more than personal inconvenience and financial
hardship, and is not the result of actions by the appellant.
   D.   Granting the variance will not confer upon the appellant any special
privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures, or
buildings in the same zoning district.
   E.   Granting the variance will not interfere with or substantially injure
the appropriate use of adjacent conforming properties in the same zoning
district.
   F.   The reasons set forth in the appeal justify the granting of the
variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible
the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
   G.   Granting the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   H.   No variance shall be granted from any written conditions attached by
another decision-maker to the approval of a rezoning, conditional use permit,
subdivision plat, or site plan.
   I.   No variance shall be granted if the conditions or circumstances
affecting the applicant's property are of so general or recurrent a nature as
to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
conditions or situations.
   J.   No non-conforming use or violations of this chapter with respect to
neighboring lands, structures or buildings, in the same zoning district, and no
permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other zoning districts,
shall be considered grounds for granting a variance.
   K.   Every decision of the Board shall be based upon the findings of fact,
and every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of its proceedings.
The conditions required by this chapter to exist on any matter upon which the
Board is authorized to pass under this chapter shall be construed as
limitations on the power of the Board to act. A mere finding or recitation of
the enumerated conditions, unaccompanied by findings of specific fact, shall
not be deemed findings of fact, and shall not be deemed in compliance with this
chapter. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-6-9.4: EXPIRATION AND TIME EXTENSIONS:
   A.   Expiration: In any case where a variance has not been used within one
year after its granting by the Board of Adjustment shall become null and void.

consider the granting of a time extension of no more than one additional year
as follows:
      1.   Upon request by the applicant.
      2.   When the request is filed in writing with the Community Development
Department not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the
original variance approval.
      3.   When accompanied by a time extension fee in accordance with the fee
schedule of the City of Eloy.
      4.   Upon determination by the Board that there have been no changes in
the circumstances or in the vicinity of the property or use which would render
the previously approved variance inappropriate. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
21-6-9.5: REVOCATION:
   A.   Revocation: The Board of Adjustment shall be authorized to hold a
public hearing to consider the revocation of a variance previously granted in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A written notice of the date,
time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be served on the owner of the
property for which the variance was granted by registered mail, return receipt
requested, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of such hearing.
   B.   Findings: A variance may be revoked if, from the facts presented at the
public hearing or by investigation, the Board makes an affirmative
determination on any one of the following findings:
      1.   That the variance was obtained by fraud.
      2.   That the variance granted is being exercised contrary to the
conditions of approval of such variance or in violation of any applicable law,
license, ordinance, permit or regulation. (Ord. 18-880, 7-23-2018)
