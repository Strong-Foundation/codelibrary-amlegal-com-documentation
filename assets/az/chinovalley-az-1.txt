discussion and revision of proposals or submittals and such revisions may be
permitted after submissions and before award for the purpose of obtaining best
and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of

apply to the Department for a fire hydrant meter. The application may be
approved subject to the applicant’s compliance with all rules and regulations
established by the Department pertaining to the use of construction water from

contractor shall be responsible for any damage to the hydrant meter, costs of
which shall be determined by the Public Works Director.
      (2)   Whenever the use of un-metered water on a street, pipeline or other
public improvement project is approved by the Public Works Director, it shall
be the duty of the Department to furnish the Finance Department with an
estimate of all un-metered water used. The water shall be billed to the

addition, there will be a charge equal to the cost plus overhead for any work
performed, and materials used by the town to provide construction water access
for the contractor.

§ 51.058 EXTENSIONS; POLICY OF TOWN GENERALLY.
   The water and sewer main extension policy of the town for areas beyond
present town trunk mains and the policy to be followed in connection therewith
shall be, and the same is hereby declared to be, as follows: The town desires
to encourage the development of undeveloped areas through repayment for extra
costs incurred in construction of “off-site” mains that are necessary to serve
new developments, and bring service to existing developments, in order to
distribute the costs of extending the mains between two or more developers.
This policy would apply where a main extension was constructed by one developer
and connected to or utilized at a later date by one or more developers or
property owners. For this purpose, a WATER OR SEWER MAIN is defined as a main
constructed from the town’s existing point of connection to, and along, the
frontage or boundary of the development with the capacity to serve additional
developments. However, the developer must pay all costs for engineering design
and construction of mains of such size as to afford adequate capacity and
service for specific “service areas” to be served by such mains.

§ 51.059 APPROACH MAINS; CONSTRUCTION BY DEVELOPERS; REPAYMENT AGREEMENT.
   (A)   An approach main may be constructed by the town, or by a developer, in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   The final detailed plans and specifications for an “approach main”
shall be approved by the Town Engineer and Public Works Director prior to
construction. The engineering cost for the preparation of plans,
specifications, ADEQ and/or Yavapai County review fees, and permit fees, and
construction staking of the “approach main” incurred by a developer may be
included in the calculation of repayable costs as provided for in this section.
The plans and bid line items for the approach mains shall be clearly and
distinctly separated from all other on-site plan sheets and bid items.
   (C)   The cost of distribution mains within the boundaries of a development
shall not be eligible for repayment. Where booster pumps and storage tanks are
necessary to maintain reserve, peak and fire flow capacity and/or to maintain
adequate pressures in the water mains due to the development being near or
above the hydraulic gradient in the town service area, the developer shall
provide adequate land, and construct, at his or her own expense, the necessary
storage facility and booster pumping station to town specifications. The town
will assume ownership, maintenance and operation of the property and facilities
upon completion and acceptance by the town.
   (D)   The town may utilize line charges to facilitate the repayment of
repayable costs associated with an approach main, provided that such line
charges shall expire after 20 years, and that the town shall record notice of
such line charges in the office of the Yavapai County Recorder. For an approach
main that was constructed by a private developer, line charges may only be
utilized if repayable costs have been established pursuant to a repayment
agreement and approved by the Town Council. Repayable costs to be included in a
repayment agreement shall be determined by the Town Engineer, based on an
estimate by the developer’s design engineer and after consideration of
comparable projects.
   (E)   The town reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to require an
increase in the diameter of an approach main, in which case, if the increased
diameter exceeds 12 inches for a water main or 18 inches for a sewer main, the
town shall pay the cost of the materials required to increase the diameter of
the main from 12 inches for a water main, 18 inches for a sewer main, or the
diameter required by the developer, whichever is larger, and the increased
diameter required by the town.
   (F)   If the town will pay any portion of the cost of an approach main with
public funds, that approach main shall be designed and constructed in
compliance with A.R.S. Title 34 and funds to be used for reimbursement shall be
approved by Town Council.
   (G)   Improvement or community facility districts. When justified by the
anticipated scope or cost of construction, a community facilities district or
an improvement district may be formed by the Town Council at its sole
discretion and in accordance with provisions of state and local law.

written notice with the Public Works Director which identifies the:
      (1)   Name and address of the existing or prospective users;
      (2)   Business location(s) served, or to be served, by the sanitary sewer
system;
      (3)   Nature, concentration and amounts of any substance present at, or
intended to be present at, such business location(s) which, if discharged to
the sanitary sewer system, could constitute an industrial discharge; and
      (4)   Nature and concentration of all pollutants currently discharged to
the sanitary sewer system from the business location(s).
   (D)   Carry out, and maintain an adequate record of, all self-inspection and
self-monitoring activities necessary for the user to know at all times whether
or not such user is introducing any industrial discharge to the sanitary sewer
system.
   (E)   Assist the Public Works Director to determine the exact nature,
concentration and volume of any pollutant intended for discharge to the
sanitary sewer system. Upon request by the Public Works Director, any user or
industrial user shall promptly:
      (1)   Allow the examination and copying of all relevant records or
documents stored, filed or available from other locations to the user;
      (2)   Allow the inspection of all business locations served by the
sanitary sewer system, including all pretreatment equipment, methods and
activities utilized by the user at the locations;
      (3)   Install and maintain, at the user’s expense, convenient and
adequate monitoring and/or sampling point(s) with appropriate, calibrated
equipment approved by the Public Works Director for monitoring and/or sampling
purposes;

   (F)   Not cause an industrial discharge without having first obtained a
permit required by this chapter. The industrial user shall comply with all
requirements and conditions of said permit. Once a permit is issued, no
industrial user shall:
      (1)   Make any new or increased industrial discharge, or otherwise make
any change in the nature of its industrial discharge(s), if the change will
cause any new or increased industrial discharge, without first obtaining an
amended permit.
      (2)   Fail to give written notice to the Department of not less than 90
days prior to any facility expansion, production increase or process
modifications which results, or may result, in new or increased discharges or a
change in the nature of the discharge.

         (c)   Ensure that such a discharge does not occur again.
   (I)   Pay all fees charged by the town for the wastewater collection,
treatment and recharge services provided by the sanitary sewer system pursuant
to the requirements of this chapter. The service fees will apply equally to all
sanitary sewer system users and will be determined by each user’s proportionate
share of the sanitary sewer system operating and maintenance costs. In turn,
the proportionate share will be based on such factors as the strength, volume
and rate of flow of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer system by each
user.
   (J)   Reimburse the town for all extraordinary expenses reasonably incurred
by the town in insuring such sanitary sewer system user’s compliance with the
applicable requirements of this chapter. An extraordinary expense is any cost
not otherwise reimbursed from the normal collection of sewer fees.

requirements of any permit issued and/or of this chapter;
      (5)   Carrying out any measure needed for the protection of human health
or safety, the environment, the sanitary sewer system or any other property in
order to correct or mitigate any harm or degradation of existing quality caused
by the violation of any categorical standard or pretreatment requirement.
   (K)   Be financially responsible for all injury, damage and/or loss suffered
by any person as a result of any industrial discharge by the user which
violates any categorical standard, pretreatment requirement or permit condition
enforced pursuant to this chapter. In particular, the user shall be liable for
the:
      (1)   Personal injury suffered by any person as a result of the
discharge;
      (2)   Costs reasonably incurred by any person in correcting, or otherwise
mitigating, any adverse environmental impact which resulted from the discharge;
and

monitoring wastewater analysis indicates a violation has occurred, the user
shall:
      (1)   Inform the Public Works Director of the violation within 24 hours
of becoming aware of the violation; and
      (2)   Repeat the wastewater sampling and pollutant analysis and submit in
writing the results of the repeat analysis within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation, unless the Public Works Director requires it sooner.
   (M)   In addition to the above requirements, the user shall:
      (1)   Notify the Public Works Director, the EPA Regional Wastewater
Management Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the sanitary sewer system of a substance which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under Title 40 C.F.R. part
261. Such notification shall include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in Title 40 C.F.R. part 261, EPA hazardous waste number and type of
discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the sanitary sewer
system, the notification shall also contain the following information to the
extent the information is known and readily available to the industrial user:
an estimation of the mass and concentration of the constituents in the waste
stream discharged during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. Industrial users shall provide the notification no later than 180
days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any
notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharged. Notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under
Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does
not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements
of Title 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b), (d) and (e).
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (M)(1)
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms
of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified
in Title 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in Title 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and
261.33(c) requires a 1-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste
require additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user shall notify the Public
Works Director of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the
effective date of the regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this division (M), the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practicable and that it has selected the method of treatment,
storage and/or disposal currently available which minimizes the present and
future threat to human health and the environment.
   (N)   Sign all permit applications using the appropriate signatory:
      (1)   For a corporation: By a corporate officer of (or) other persons
performing a similar policy or decision-making function for the corporation;
      (2)   For a partnership or sole proprietorship: By a general partner or
the proprietor, respectively; or
      (3)   For a government entity: By the administrator, chairperson,
director or principal executive responsible for operations at the facility.
   (O)   Ensure that all applications, correspondence, reports and self-
monitoring reports are signed by a duly authorized representative of the person
described in division (N) above. Any change in signatures or positions shall be
submitted to the Public Works Director in writing within 30 days after the
change. A person is a duly authorized representative only if:
      (1)   The authorization is made by a person described in division (N)
above; and
      (2)   The authorization specified either an individual or a position
having the responsibility for the overall operation of the regulated facility
or activity, such as the position of plant manager, superintendent, or position
of equivalent responsibility. (A duly authorized representative may thus be
either a named individual or an individual occupying a named position.)
   (P)   Any person signing a document under this subchapter shall make the
following certification:
      “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the

      (4)   State that prior to discharge of hauled waste, the permittee shall
allow a town designated representative to sample the waste, if so required or
deemed necessary, to ensure compliance with discharge limits and requirements.
The permittee shall not discharge the NHLW until the initial analysis is
complete. The Public Works Director reserves the right to refuse permission to
discharge any load that may not be treatable at the facility, or will inhibit,
interfere or otherwise be incompatible with the operation and function of the
CTR system.
      (5)   Require the permittee to carry liability insurance in such amount
and in such form as shall be determined by the Public Works Director. The
insurance shall, at a minimum, provide general liability coverage, including
contractual liability, in the amount of $1 million combined single limit. Motor
vehicle liability insurance shall be in the minimum amounts as outlined in
A.R.S. § 28-4033. Workers compensation insurance, if applicable, shall comply
with state requirements. Evidence of the insurance shall be provided to the
Public Works Director. The requirement shall not in any manner preclude the
permittee from obtaining such additional insurance coverage as may be necessary
for his or her protection.
      (6)   Require the permittee (as “indemnitor”) to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Town (as “indemnitee”) from and against any and all claims,
losses, liability, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees)
(herein collectively referred to as “claims”) arising out of bodily injury of
any person (including death) or property damage to the extent that such claims
are caused by the negligence, misconduct or other fault of the indemnitor, its
agents, employees or contractors.
      (7)   Specify the discharge limitations and requirements as deemed
appropriate by the Public Works Director.
   (D)   The permittee is responsible for protecting the CTR system from any
contributing discharges which would inhibit, interfere or otherwise be
incompatible with the operation or maintenance of the collection system or
treatment plant including the use or disposal of municipal sludge or effluent.
The permittee shall comply with all requirements and conditions of its permit.
   (E)   The permit is nontransferable. In the event of any change in control
or ownership, the permittee shall notify the Public Works Director. The new

subchapter have been satisfied, or unless written permission is otherwise
provided by the Public Works Director.
   (F)   The Public Works Director is authorized to take appropriate
enforcement action against any person in noncompliance with this subchapter.
All penalties assessed to the town by federal and/or state agencies as a result
of a violation shall be recoverable from the violator. In addition to the
enforcement available to the Public Works Director that is contained herein,
the Public Works Director may:
      (1)   Suspend for a period of up to 30 days the permit of any hauler for
the first violation of any provision of the permit or any provision of this
subchapter. Following the first period of suspension, the waste hauler permit
may be reinstated only after payment of the fee for reinstatement, which shall
be as adopted by resolution of the Council.
      (2)   Suspend for a period of up to 180 days the permit of any hauler
committing a subsequent violation of a provision of the permit or a provision
of this subchapter. Following the second period of suspension for a subsequent
violation, the permit may be reinstated only after payment of the reinstatement
fee, which shall be as adopted by resolution of the Council. In addition to any
reinstatement fee required to be paid under this section, the hauler shall
either pay or make arrangements acceptable to the Public Works Director to pay
any expenses the town incurs by reason of the violation.
      (3)   A suspension may be appealed by the permit holder to the Town
Council by submitting within 15 days of receipt of the notice of suspension, an
appeal in writing, setting forth the specific grounds for the appeal. The
appeal shall be filed with the Town Clerk. Filing of an appeal will not stay
the suspension or the fees for reinstatement. A lesser fee for reinstatement
may be charged by the Town Council if it is found that the permit holder has
taken substantial action to prevent further violations.

   (A)   The Public Works Director or his or her designee shall have the
authority to make whatever tests are necessary to carry out a planned sampling
program and to make whatever analyses are needed for all commercial and
industrial users. The BOD test shall be considered the standard test; however,
COD or TOC tests may be substituted in cases where it has been determined by
the Public Works Director that the BOD test is not representative of actual
wastewater loading. Wastewater characteristics shall be determined by the
Department on the basis of monitored wastewater discharged, a certified
statement from the user, or on the best available data as to the
characteristics of the discharges.
   (B)   Any change in the ongoing process(es) employed by a user contributing
commercial or industrial waste which results in a variation of more than 25% in

exists between the user’s certified data and the discharge characteristics
monitored by the Department, the town may adjust the sewer use charge based on
the monitored data from the original date of certification, unless written
communication has occurred notifying the Department of changes in loading and
giving specific dates of changes.
   (D)   Where sampling and gauging of specific users is not practical for
physical, economic, safety, or other reasons, the Public Works Director may
designate values for concentrations of the wastes discharged into the sewerage
system for all users in the same Standard Industrial Classification or
subclassification.

Finance Director shall at such time recommend a revision in the sewer service
charge and user classes to accomplish the following:
      (1)   Maintain a reasonable proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance costs among users and user classes;
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance (including
replacement) of the treatment works; and
      (3)   Generate sufficient funds to support a capital improvement plan
(C.P.) as approved by Council.
      (4)   Apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the costs
of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year and
adjust the rate accordingly.
   (B)   Inconsistent agreements. The user charge system set forth in this

property if the payment of the fees is delinquent for more than 90 days.
   (B)   Before filing the lien, the Town Clerk or Finance Director shall
provide written notice to the owner of the property. The notice shall be given
at least 30 days before filing the lien and shall include an opportunity for a
hearing before an official, to be designated by the town council for such
purposes. Subject to division (C), below, the notice shall be either served
personally on or mailed to the property owner, at the last known address by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or to the address to which the tax
bill for the property was last mailed as shown in the county records.
   (C)   If the owner does not reside on the property, the notice shall be sent
to the last known address.
   (D)   If served by mail, notice shall be deemed to be complete on the date
on which the notice is deposited in the United States mail.
   (E)   The notice shall inform the property owner that:
      (1)   He or she has the opportunity for a hearing regarding the
delinquency before a designated town official;
      (2)   If a timely objection is not filed, the unpaid delinquency shall be
deemed due and owing and failure to pay shall result in the town pursuing all
available means of collection as authorized by the town code;
      (3)   If a hearing is requested and it is determined as a result of the
hearing that the unpaid delinquency is due and owing, failure to pay shall
result in the town pursuing all available means of collection as authorized by
the town code.
   (F)   In the event the property owner requests a hearing, such request must
be received not later than 15 days from the date of the notice. The request for
hearing must include copies of all documents that support the owner’s position,
including any documents that there is no delinquency or that the amount claimed
delinquent by the town is in error. A hearing shall be scheduled and held not
later than 30 days following a request for a hearing by a property owner. The
property owner shall be notified in writing of the time and date of the
hearing.
   (G)   The hearing shall be held by a hearing officer who shall be a non-town
employee retained by the town, or a town employee who has no involvement with
the Utilities Division or the Finance Department. The hearing officer shall
have the authority prescribed to public officers pursuant to A.R.S. § 12-2212,
as may be amended from time to time.
   (H)   The hearing may be continued one time by the hearing officer upon the
written request of either party for good cause.
   (I)   The hearing shall be held during regular town business hours.
   (J)   The hearing shall be recorded by an electronic recording device.
   (K)   The property owner and the town shall each be given an opportunity to

      (2)   Submission of evidence;
      (3)   Presentation of witnesses; and
      (4)   Cross examination.
   The Arizona Rules of Evidence shall not apply, and the hearing officer may
permit the admission of any evidence deemed relevant to the issues at hand.
   (L)   The hearing officer shall render a decision within 15 days of the
close of the hearing. The record of the hearing and the decision by the hearing
officer shall be filed with the Town Clerk. The hearing officer’s order shall
be mailed to the property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested,
and notice of the order shall be deemed to be complete upon the date on which
the notice is deposited in the United States mail.
   (M)   The hearing officer may find the following:
      (1)   The property owner does not owe the delinquent amount and the
notice of delinquency shall be canceled;
      (2)   The property owner does owe the delinquent amount as noticed by the
town and order that the amount be paid within 20 days of the date the decision
is rendered; or
      (3)   A different (lesser) amount than that which was noticed by the town
is owed and delinquent and order that amount be paid within 20 days of the date
the decision is rendered.

event payment is not made on a delinquent amount as determined by a hearing
officer after a hearing, the town shall place a lien on the property in
accordance with this section.
   (P)   The unpaid utility user fees are a lien on the property from the date
of the recording of the lien in the Office of the County Recorder until all
fees are paid in full. The lien is subject and inferior to the lien for general
taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances of record. A sale of
the property to satisfy a lien obtained under this section shall be made
following a judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. The town may bring an
action to enforce the lien in the Yavapai County Superior Court at any time
after the recording of the lien, but failure to enforce the lien by a
foreclosure lawsuit shall not affect the validity of the lien. The recorded
unpaid utility user fees lien shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all
matters recited in the recording and of the regularity of all proceedings
before the recording.
   (Q)   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, any lien placed
on a property pursuant to this section shall be enforceable pursuant to and in
accordance with A.R.S. § 9-511.02.

notice to abate is a hardship and if the person in control agrees in writing to
a schedule for correcting the violation bringing the property into compliance
with the requirements of this title and complies with the schedule.

him or her by certified return receipt requested mail at his or her last known

County Assessor’s Office, if different.
      (2)   Notice is deemed effective on the date it is hand delivered or five
calendar days after it is deposited in the United States mail.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall preclude the town from giving additional oral
or written notice at its discretion. If the town elects to give additional
notice in any instance, it shall not thereby become obligated to give such
additional notice thereafter in the same or other situation.

no financial hardship and require the fee to be paid.

for appeal of a notice to abate or assessment:

         (a)   In any case where a provision of this title is in conflict with

of the town existing on the effective date of this title, the provision which
establishes the higher standard for promoting and protecting public health and
safety shall prevail.
         (b)   This title is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any
way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances,
except those specifically repealed by this title, or with private restrictions
placed upon the property by covenant, deed, or other private agreement.
         (c)   In cases where 2 or more provisions of this title are in
conflict, the most stringent or restrictive shall prevail.
      (2)   Special assessment lien.
         (a)   If the town is required to correct or abate a violation pursuant
to this section, the town shall prepare a verified statement and account of the
actual cost of such correction or abatement, including an additional 10% of the
actual costs for inspection and other incidental costs incurred in connection
with such correction or abatement. The verified statement and account shall be
an assessment upon the property on which the town corrected or abated the
violations and shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
other town assessments are collected. Such assessment shall be recorded in the
office of the Yavapai County Recorder and from the date of its recording shall
be a lien on the property. Such lien shall be prior and superior to all other
liens, obligations, mortgages or other encumbrances, except liens for general
taxes. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under the provisions
of this section shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure and order of sale.
The town may institute an action to enforce the lien in the Yavapai County
Superior Court at any time after the recording of the assessment. Failure to
enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its validity. The recorded
assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited
therein and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the recording
thereof.
         (b)   A prior assessment pursuant to this title shall not be a bar to
a subsequent assessment, and any numbers of liens on the same lot or tract of
land may be enforced in the same action.

official declare that an immediate or potential hazard to the public exists
which arises from or affects a licensed business activity, the Town Clerk may
immediately suspend the affected license and order the business activity
discontinued immediately. The suspension shall continue as long as the
emergency situation is present or affects the business.

which occurs after issuance of a business license may be grounds for revocation
or non renewal of a business license.

subsequently made, written notice of any conditions imposed as prerequisite to
the issuance of a license must be mailed to the applicant.
   (B)   The conditions which may be imposed by the Parks and Recreation
Director are as follows:

the preservation of order and protection of property in and around the place of
the festival. The patrolers shall be required to be licensed to the extent that
licensing may from time to time be required under state law. They must be in
attendance, wearing uniforms, at all times the event is in operation. Where the
Chief of Police authorizes the employment of off duty peace officers to meet

provided at all times of operation before a license is issued. If a private
patrol agency is to be used, the applicant must submit a written agreement

treatment facilities on the premises. The location of the facilities, number
and qualifications of medical and paramedical persons needed to staff the
facilities and the quantity of medical supplies, drugs, ambulances and other
equipment that must be on the site, must be approved by the county’s Health
Department prior to the issuance of any license under this chapter. Medical
personnel must be licensed pursuant to local regulations and state laws. The
county’s Health Department shall calculate the need for medical services, based
on the number of persons expected to attend the public amusement or festival,
their expected age group, the duration of events planned and the possibility of
exposure to inclement weather and outdoor elements.
      (6)   Parking areas. Every licensee shall provide adequate parking space
for persons attending a festival by motor vehicle. Applicants may be called
upon to provide separate space for the festival, separate from or in addition
to the premises where the festival is to be conducted. Individual parking areas

standards for safe traffic engineering, including compliance with applicable
fire code regulations. Planning and zoning will establish minimum parking for

entranceways shall exist to insure orderly flow of traffic into the premises
from a highway or road which is a part of the town's system of highways or
which is a highway maintained by the State of Arizona. The chief of police must
approve the licensee’s plan for ingress and egress before a license shall be
issued. Additionally, any applicant may be required to show that traffic guards
are under his or her employment to insure orderly traffic movement and relieve
traffic congestion in the vicinity of the festival area.
      (8)   Hours of operation. Every festival shall close and cease operation
continuously between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. of each and every

licensee’s insurance is primary over any other insurance available to the town.
      (12)   Worker’s compensation. The licensee shall provide satisfactory
evidence of worker’s compensation.

and against any and all claims, judgments or attorney’s fees arising out of the
occurrence of any event related to the holding of the festival, including any
such claims that are based upon the negligence of the town, it being the
specific intent of the licensee to indemnify the town for any loss arising out
of the occurrence of any event related to the holding of the festival, even if
caused by the town’s own negligence.

   (B)   Any privilege claimed under any license by the licensee in any street

department, or board of the town shall be subject to transfer by the town to
any other officer, employee, department, or board of the town.

§ 114.06 ACQUISITION OF FACILITIES BY TOWN UPON TERMINATION.

license held by a licensee is denied and the town acquires ownership of the
cable system, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value,
determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with
no value allocated to the license itself. If a license held by a licensee is
revoked for cause and the town acquires ownership of the cable system or
effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, such
matters as the harm to the community resulting from the licensee's breach of
the license may be considered in determining the fair market value.

whether by expiration or forfeiture, the Council may direct and require the

cables, fixtures and accessories and appurtenances from the streets. If
directed, the town shall make a claim on the letter of credit as prescribed in
§
114.50 Construction Bonds. Removal by licensee of its wires, cable, fixtures
and accessories and appurtenances from the streets shall not be required where
such wires, cables, fixtures and accessories and appurtenances are in use for
the provision of services other than cable services as to which no license from
the town is required, or as to which any license that is required has been
obtained.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.07 RIGHTS RESERVED TO THE TOWN.
   (A)   The town reserves its rights to acquire the property of the licensee,
by purchase, at fair market value, which shall not include any amount for the
license itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted. The town
reserves the right to exercise its power of eminent domain under the Arizona
Constitution and laws of the state.
   (B)   Neither the granting of any license nor the enactment of any provision
in this chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any
governmental right or power of the town, now existing or hereafter granted.
   (C)   The town's right to acquire the property of the licensee shall not
require the licensee to convey such property that is in use for the provision
of services other than cable services as to which no license from the town is
required, or as to which any license that is required had been obtained. If the
cable system is operated by the owner for both telecommunications and cable
services purposes, the town must have separate authority outside of this
chapter to acquire those facilities used for telecommunications purposes.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)

(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.10 SELECTION OF LICENSEE.
   (A)   Compliance with town requirements. A person submitting an application
for a new license to operate a cable system shall provide all information set
forth in §
114.08 License Application Procedures or otherwise required by this chapter and
all other information requested in the town's request for applications. Each
new license application shall be responsive to the questions soliciting the
information, and shall completely, accurately and materially supply all of the
information so solicited. Any misrepresentation, failure, neglect or refusal to
provide any of such information may, at the option of the town, render an
application invalid. This requested information must be complete and verified
as true by the applicant.
   (B)   Property of town. All applications for new licenses received by the
town from an applicant shall become the sole property of the town.
   (C)   Referral to manager. Upon receipt of any application for license, the
Town Manager shall prepare or cause to be prepared a report, including
recommendations respecting such application, to be presented to the Town
Council at a public hearing on the application. The town will evaluate all
applications submitted within 180 days of receipt of the application.
   (D)   Investigations. The town may make such investigations as it deems
necessary to determine the ability of the applicant for a new license to
perform under the license, and the applicant shall furnish to the town all such
information as the town may request.
   (E)   Public hearing. Within 180 days after receiving an application for a
new license, a public hearing shall be held to consider the application and
receive public comments.
   (F)   Consideration. In making any determination regarding the application
for a license, the town may consider any and all factors relevant to interests
of the community in cable television including, but not limited to, the quality
of the cable services proposed, areas to be served, rates to subscriber,
benefit to the town, experience, character, background, and financial
responsibility of any applicant, and its management and owners, technical and
performance quality of equipment, willingness and ability to meet construction
and physical requirements, to meet all requirements set forth in this chapter,
and to abide by all policy conditions, license limitations and requirements,
and all other matters deemed pertinent by the town for satisfying the community
needs and for safeguarding the interests of the town and the public.
   (G)   Timeframes. The determination shall be completed within the following
maximum timeframes: (1) for cable operators with existing authority to access
streets, after 90 days; and (2) for persons that do not have authority to
access streets, 180 days. The times start on the date an applicant files an
application or other writing including certain minimum information which is set
forth in §
114.08 License Application Procedures and deemed complete by the town. The town
and an applicant may agree, in writing, to extend the 90- or 180-day time
period for negotiations. It may then be adopted at the date as permitted by
this section. If the 90/180-day time elapses without action by the town, the
applicant is automatically granted an interim license based on the application
submitted. Thereafter, the town and applicant may continue to negotiate the
terms of a license in an attempt to reach a negotiated license. The 90/180-day
time may be tolled by the town if it has requested and not received information
from the applicant.
   (H)   Determination. Following the public hearing, the Council may direct
staff to conduct further negotiations with an applicant, or set further public
hearings. Within 180 days following the first public hearing on an application
for a new license, the Council shall make 1 of the following determinations:
      (1)   That such application is denied, which determination shall be final
and conclusive; or
      (2)   That such license is granted with the terms and conditions approved
by Council.
   (I)   Approval or denial based on public record. It is the intention of the
town to approve or deny a new license solely on the basis of the public record.
   (J)   Town Council decisions shall be final. Any decision of the Council
approving or denying a new license shall be final.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.11 TERM OF LICENSE.
   Unless otherwise provided in the license, the term of any license shall not
exceed 15 years. A license may be renewed by the town pursuant to the procedure
established in §
114.13 Renewals and in accordance with the then-applicable law.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.12 GRANT OF ADDITIONAL LICENSE AND COMPETING SERVICE.
   Since competing or overlapping licenses may encourage the introduction of
better cable services and quality at lower prices, the town will at all times
attempt to accommodate additional entrants. At the same time it is recognized
that the introduction of overlapping cable systems could have a potential
adverse impact on the streets, and on the quality and availability of existing
cable services to the public. Accordingly, the town shall issue a license in an
area where another licensee is operating only following a public hearing to
consider the potential impact which the grant of an additional license may have
on the community and the streets. In considering whether to grant 1 or more
additional licenses, the town shall specifically consider, and address in a
written report, the following issues:
   (A)   Whether or not applicant has provided, at a minimum, information with
its application as required by §
114.08 License Application Procedures, and application fee described in §
114.09 License Application Fees;
   (B)   The legal, technical, and financial qualifications of applicant and
agreement by a licensee to comply with such requirements of the town as may be
determined by it to be applicable to a licensee in conformance with applicable
law;
   (C)   Acceptance of a license and the terms therein;
   (D)   The capacity of the streets to accommodate 1 or more additional cable
systems and the potential disruption of streets and private property that may
occur if 1 or more additional licenses are granted; and
   (E)   Such other information as the town may deem appropriate to be
considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping license.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.13 RENEWALS.
   Renewals will be processed and granted according to valid applicable law, as
amended. The town and a licensee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal
negotiations at any time during the license term of a license agreement.
Pursuant to applicable law, the town will review and evaluate the past
performance of a licensee, including compliance with an existing license. The
town will also consider review and determination of current and future
community needs and the technical, financial, and legal capabilities of a
licensee to meet the current and future cable service-related needs in a new
license considering the reasonable cost to do so.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.14 TRANSFERS AND ASSIGNMENTS.
   (A)   A license shall not be sold, assigned or transferred, either in whole
or in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein,
pass to or vest in any person, without prior written consent of the town, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (B)   The transfer of an existing license to an affiliate of licensee does
not require prior approval of the town so long as (a) licensee provided written
notice to town at least 30 days prior to the transfer and has provided
information sufficient for town to determine that the transfer is as described
in (b) or (c) of this section and the proposed transfer will not cause any
increased risks of nonperformance of the license or any loss to the town of its
bargained for consideration in the license; (b) the transfer is to an entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with licensee; or (c) a
transfer is in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of
any rights, title, or interest of licensee in the license or cable system in
order to secure indebtedness. If town objects to the transfer, it shall notify
licensee in writing within 20 days of receipt of the written notice, in which
case the transfer of control shall be stayed until town confirms in its
discretion that it is as described in (b) or (c) above; otherwise, a transfer
of control shall be deemed to occur when the legal or practical ability to
exert actual working control over the affairs of the licensee transfers to a
person other than the licensee, either directly or indirectly, whether by
contractual agreement, majority ownership interest, any lesser ownership
interest or in any other manner. Consent of the town shall not be required for
a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other hypothecation in whole or in part to
secure an indebtedness. The transferee must assume all obligations of the
license and provide new insurance and performance bonds.
   (C)   Except for a transfer to an affiliate of licensee, no change,
transfer, or acquisition of control of the licensee shall occur without prior
written consent of the town, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
The licensee shall promptly notify the town of any actual or proposed change
in, or transfer to, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the
licensee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major
stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.
   (D)   A rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred shall
arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or affiliated group
(other than an affiliate of licensee) of more than 25% of the voting interest
of the licensee or of the person exercising management authority over the
licensee.
   (E)   Except in the case of an assignment of the license to an affiliate of
licensee, upon written notification by the licensee to the town of a proposed
assignment of the license, or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee
company, the manager shall issue his written notice fixing and setting forth
the day, hour and place certain when and where any persons having any interest
therein may appear and be heard. The Clerk shall cause such notice to be
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the town. The Clerk also
shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to the licensee at least 10 days
prior to the date specified for the hearing. At the time set for such hearing,
or at any adjournment thereof, the manager shall proceed to hear the matter.
Following the close of such hearing, the manager shall prepare and file with
the Council his report of the hearing, his findings, and an opinion containing
his recommendations and the reasons therefor. If, after the expiration of 10
days following receipt of the manager's report and opinion, the Council shall
find that the assignment of the license or transfer of control or ownership of
the licensee company will not be detrimental or injurious to the best interests
and welfare of the subscribers and users, and of the town, then the Council by
resolution shall consent to the assignment of the license or transfer of
control or ownership of the licensee company. Such resolution shall thereupon
become and shall be a part of any license granted under this chapter and
affected thereby.
   (F)   The consent or approval of the Council to any transfer of a license
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the town in and to
the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to
the terms and conditions of the license.
   (G)   Except in the case of an assignment of the license to an affiliate of
licensee, each applicant for a transfer or assignment must furnish with its
request a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount of $2,500 payable in cash,
certified or cashier's check, wire transfer, or in any other manner acceptable
to the manager made payable to the town. No application for a transfer or
assignment of license shall be considered without receipt of said fee. The
licensee shall be responsible for reimbursing the town's full reasonable costs
in excess of the application fee in investigating the qualifications of the
transferee under the Cable Act as part of acting on the licensee's request for
a transfer or assignment of a license.
   (H)   The town shall act on any request for approval of a sale or transfer
within 120 days of the request if the request contains or is accompanied by the
information required by the FCC and this chapter.
   (I)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership be approved without the
successor-in-interest becoming a signatory to the license.
   (J)   As long as a grant, rent or lease does not amount to a transfer as
defined in this section and is made in the ordinary course of business with
prior notice to the town, a licensee in the normal course of providing cable
services may grant, rent, or lease use of its cable system to other persons.
Any such use shall be restricted to and consistent with (1) such uses as the
licensee is authorized in this chapter and the license, (2) other
telecommunications services which have received a license from town, or (3)
other telecommunications services for which no license is required by the town.
Any such use shall be in compliance with applicable federal and state law. Any
such grants, lease or rent by the licensee shall not, however, thereby relieve
its use of the streets and public ways, and any such grant, rent or lease shall
require that such other person comply with the appropriate provisions of this
chapter and the license as such use warrants. The grant, lease or rent shall
expressly provide for the authority of the town under applicable law to
regulate the use provided by the grant, lease or rent (including but not
limited to the authority to protect the public welfare, safety and health) and
to enforce compliance with any applicable standards established by this chapter
or the license. be a privilege which is personal to the original grantee. It
shall not be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in
part, either by sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, without prior consent
of the Council expressed by resolution, and then only under such conditions as
may therein be prescribed.

§ 114.15 EFFECT OF AWARD OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Ordinance binding. Upon award of license pursuant to this chapter, a
licensee shall be bound by all the terms and conditions contained in this
chapter.
   (B)   Incorporation by reference of application for a license. A licensee
shall provide all of the cable service specifically set forth in its
application to provide cable services within the license area, and by its
acceptance of the license, the licensee specifically agrees that its
application is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the license.
In the event of a conflict between the license and the application, the
provisions of the license shall apply. Failure to provide services as promised
in licensee's application or agreed to in its license may be deemed a breach of
this chapter, to which the provisions of §
114.51 Liquidated Damages shall apply.

operation of its cable system within the town are valuable public properties
acquired and maintained by the town at great expense to its taxpayers, and that
the grant to the licensee for the use of said streets is a valuable property
right without which the licensee would be required to invest substantial
capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the town will incur
costs in regulating and administering the license, the licensee shall pay to
the town a license fee in an amount no more than 5% of licensee's annual gross
revenues.
   (B)   If licensee provides its subscriber a bundling discount if the
subscriber purchases a bundle of cable service and non-cable services, then the
price of cable service included in the bundle shall be allocated based on the
licensee's standard, non-discounted rate. For example: if a subscriber's
charges for a given month for cable service alone would be $40, for local
telephone service alone would be $30, and for internet services alone would be
$30, for a total of $100; and if the 3 services are then bundled and offered at
a combined price of $80 (overall 20% discount), then the gross revenue from the
cable service will be deemed to be $32 ($40, less 20% of $40.00). Licensee may
allocate the discount differently over the services, so long as such allocation
does not reduce the gross revenues from cable services below what it would be
from the above calculation. Licensee shall not use bundled package offerings as
a means of evading the payment of financial obligations that are based on cable
service revenue.
   (C)   Should federal or state laws or regulations be amended in the future
to allow the town to receive a greater fee than the fee set forth in division
(A) of this section, then the town shall have the right to increase the fee to
the extent specified in the license, or meet with licensee to modify the
license.
   (D)   The payment of the license fee by the licensee to the town shall be
made quarterly by delivery of the same to the manager on or before the
twentieth day of the month following the quarter end, and shall become
delinquent if not paid before 45 days after the end of the quarter. Payment
shall be accompanied by a license fee payment worksheet provided by the town.
If such payment is not made by the next to the last business day of the
following month, the town shall impose interest at a rate of 1.5% per month
commencing from the date payment should have been made, unless the payment is
subject to a bona fide dispute, and continuing until the payment is made.
Fractions of a month shall be considered to constitute a full month for the
purpose of computing interest. In addition to interest which may be assessed
under this division, if licensee fails to pay any license fee, licensee shall
be subject to the following civil penalties:
      (1)    A licensee who fails to pay the license fee or any portion thereof
within the time prescribed shall pay a penalty of 10% of the unpaid fee each
month, unless the licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause
and not due to willful neglect.
      (2)    A licensee who fails or refuses to pay a license fee or any
portion thereof after notice and demand by the town shall pay a penalty of 25%
of the unpaid fee, unless licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable
cause and not due to willful neglect.
      (3)    If the cause of failure to pay the licensee fee or any portion
thereof is determined by the town to be due to civil fraud or evasion of the
license fee, the licensee shall pay a penalty of 50% of the amount of
deficiency.
   (E)   The town shall have the right to inspect the licensee's cable service
income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined
to be payable under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit shall take
place within 36 months following the close of each of the licensee's fiscal
years. Any additional amount due to the town as a result of the audit shall be
paid within 30 days following written notice to the licensee by the town, said
notice shall include a copy of the audit report; provided, however, that
licensee shall not be required to pay such deficiency until 30 days after
completion of the administrative review process if licensee commences such
process pursuant to §
114.51(A)(3). If there is a deficiency in the payment of license fees to the
town of 10% or more, the town may assess the cost of the audit to the licensee.
If town owes a refund to licensee or if licensee owes additional amounts to
town, town and licensee shall agree upon a reasonable payment schedule with
interest from the date of request until paid at the rate provided for
hereunder.
   (F)   In compliance with applicable law, licensee shall not be required to
pay any town right-of-way construction permit and development review fees which
the town imposes under town code requirements on licensee's construction permit
activities in or on the town streets for cable services and such fees shall be
included in the license fee. If facilities constructed by licensee serve not
only cable services but also internet service or telecommunications services,
then licensee shall pay a proportionate cost of the permit fees attributable to
those services for which an annual license fee is not being paid.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.17 USE OF TELEPHONE COMPANY'S FACILITIES.
   If a licensee uses a telephone company's cable system distribution channels
furnished to the licensee pursuant to tariff or contract on file with a
regulatory body having jurisdiction and licensee makes no use of the streets
independent of such telephone company furnished facilities, licensee remains
fully bound by the terms of its license and this chapter.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.18 REQUIRED SERVICES AND FACILITIES.
   (A)   A licensee shall maintain the broad categories of video programming or
other services set forth in its license. Where there has been a substantial
failure to maintain the broad categories of video programming or other services
as set forth in the license, the town may, following due notice and public
hearing as provided in §§
114.52 Administrative Hearing and
114.53 Hearing by Council, direct the licensee to comply with its obligations
in this regard. Written notice of such hearing shall be provided to the
licensee and to the public at least 30 days prior to such hearing.
   (B)   A license may require a licensee to provide channel capacity to the
town for educational and governmental programming on terms and conditions
specified in the license.
   (C)   Licensee shall provide high definition television to its subscribers
as such broadcasting becomes available from the broadcasting stations on the
channels, consistent with and as required by the regulations of the FCC.

§ 114.19 SUBSCRIBER SERVICES; RATES.
   (A)   Initial rates. A licensee shall establish and notify the town of
initial rates for its cable services prior to commencement of services. All
rates established shall be reasonable, just, and fair to the public.
   (B)   Authority to regulate rates. To the extent permitted, the town may
regulate the rates for cable service in accordance with federal and state law.
   (C)   Notice of rates. Notice of rates shall be given in accordance with §
114.41 Subscriber and Town Notification.
   (D)   Any rate established shall be reasonable, just and fair to the public,
and shall provide the grantee a return upon its investment reasonably
sufficient to:
      (1)   Assure confidence in grantee's financial soundness;
      (2)   Support its credit and attract necessary capital under efficient
and economical management; and
      (3)   Provide a return to equity owners commensurate with current returns
on investment in other enterprises having corresponding risks.
   (E)   No rate established shall afford any undue preference or advantage
among subscribers, but separate rates may be established for separate classes
of subscribers and rates may reflect the populated areas where there are less
than 50 residences per strand mile or trunk line cable to be installed.
   (F)   Changes in established rates may be made by grantee by notification to
the Council, with the changes to be supported by financial data showing a
change to be necessary in accordance with division (B) above.

(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.22 GENERAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING ACCESS
   (A)   The provisions of this section shall apply to all access channels.
   (B)   Technical design of access channels and responsibilities.
      (1)   In general, the town or its designees (other than licensee) is
responsible for:
         (a)   Delivering channel signals to the licensee at origination points
and processing the signals so that they can be carried on the cable system; and
receiving signals from licensees at all connection points to public buildings
and origination points;
         (b)   Controlling the routing of signals from the origination points
to the appropriate channels; and
         (c)   Providing and maintaining the studios and equipment used to
produce programming.
      (2)   In general, licensee is responsible for transmitting access channel
signals from the origination point and/or other cities/origination points for
access programming to all connection points to public buildings and origination
points identified in the license, and to subscribers without material
degradation, and maintaining all the facilities required to do so.
   (C)   The licensee shall not take any actions that would discourage or
prevent maximum utilization of all access channels provided, and shall
cooperate with the town and managers of access channels to ensure that
subscribers are aware of the channels, can access them easily, and, to the
extent that a licensee (or some entity acting on a licensee's behalf) is
involved in publishing licensee's channel schedules, that the access channels
are similarly published.
   (D)   Public building connections. Upon request of the town and consistent
with the joint trench requirements of division (E) of this section, licensee
shall provide, without charge, at a minimum, 1 activated standard drop to all
of the following present and future public buildings, as designated by the town
from time to time:
      (1)   Town fire stations and police stations;
      (2)   All public libraries, including branches;
      (3)   Town Hall, community center, recreation facilities, senior center,
public works building and such other facilities used for municipal purposes as
may be designated in the license;
      (4)   Other locations as set forth in a license agreement. If provided in
the license, the licensee shall provide basic service free of charge to those
facilities specified above. A license may further specify the particular
conditions under which the connections will be provided.
   (E)   Joint trench requirements. The town shall notify licensee in writing
at least 30 days prior to opening trenches for use by utilities to serve public
buildings. If such notice is given and subject to the construction or rebuild
schedule and line extension policy, licensee shall install cable facilities in
order to provide the connection to the public building without charge for
trenching. If no notice is given, the town shall pay the reasonable cost of
such trenching.
   (F)   Access channel assignments. To the extent that it is legally,
economically and technically feasible, licensee will employ reasonable efforts
to use the same channel numbers for the educational and governmental access
channels as are used by another cable licensee, if any, with the greatest
number of subscribers in the town.
   (G)   Access interconnections.
      (1)   Subject to the limitations of applicable federal and state law,
licensee shall interconnect access channels with any or all other cable systems
in the town or in other nearby municipalities, owned by licensee or an
affiliate or other cable operator as provided in the license, at no cost to the
town or the other municipality.
      (2)   The town or its designated access provider shall have the right to
control and schedule the operation of all interconnected access channels. In
addition, the town shall have the right to use, at its sole discretion and at
no cost to the town, any access channels to be provided under a license
agreement for access interconnection.
      (3)   Licensee shall take all necessary technical steps to ensure that
technically adequate signal quality and routing/switching systems are initially
and continuously provided for all access interconnections between local
jurisdictions. The cost for any equipment, operation or maintenance dedicated
to such access interconnections shall be shared on pro rata basis or as
mutually agreed upon among all participating jurisdictions, and paid to
licensee.
      (4)   A licensee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to
interconnect or the town may rescind its order to interconnect upon petition by
the licensee to the town. The town shall grant said request, if it finds that a
licensee negotiated in good faith and failed to obtain an approval from another
cable system(s), governmental entity or educational institution for the
proposed interconnection.
   (H)   Access channel capital costs. The licensee voluntarily provides
grants, funding, training, services, or any other kind of support reasonably
necessary to meet the community needs of the town for the access channels, the
value of which shall be offset against the license fee in the manner provided
for by state law. If state law is amended to allow the town to require
contribution of costs, the parties shall negotiate in good faith for amendment
of this license, and licensee shall, to the extent consistent with federal law,
make capital expenditures in support of access channels and related facilities
and equipment as provided in the license. If there is more than 1 licensee
providing cable service in the town, the town will use its best efforts to
assure that the licensee's capital expenditures for access channels, facilities
and equipment are reasonably equivalent as provided in the license. To the
extent licensee's rates for cable services are subject to regulation, and to
the extent consistent with applicable law, licensee shall have the right to
treat such capital expenditures as external costs in support of access channels
in setting regulated rates for cable services.
   (I)   Access channels on basic service tier. All access channels provided to
subscribers shall be included, without limitation, on all basic tiers,
including digital basic.
   (J)   Change in technology. In the event a licensee makes any change in the
cable system and related equipment and facilities or in licensee's signal
delivery technology, licensee shall ensure that town analog signals are
converted by licensee and the signal quality or transmission of access services
or programming remains substantially the same.
   (K)   Technical quality. Licensee shall maintain all access channels and
interconnections at the same level of technical quality and reliability
required by this chapter and any license agreement and all other applicable
laws, rules and regulations for residential subscriber channels subject to the
technical quality or reliability of the signal received from the source.
Licensee shall provide routine maintenance and shall repair and replace all
transmission equipment including channel modulators, associated cable and
equipment, required to carry signal quality to and from licensee's facilities
for the access channels; provided, however, licensee shall have no duty to
provide, maintain, repair or replace equipment for which the town is
responsible under division (B)(1) of this section.
   (L)   Access cooperation. The town and licensee may agree to designate any
other jurisdiction which has entered into an agreement with the licensee or an
affiliate of the licensee to receive any access benefit due the town hereunder,
or to share in the use of access services, facilities, equipment or channel
operations hereunder. The purpose of this division shall be to allow
cooperation in the use of access channels, facilities and equipment.
   (M)   Indemnification by access programming producers and users. All local
producers and users of any of the access facilities or channels shall agree in
writing to hold harmless the licensee, the town, and any responsible
educational institution, from any and all liability or other injury (including
the reasonable cost of defending claims or litigations) arising from or in
connection with claims for failure to comply with applicable federal laws,
rules, regulations or other requirements of local, state or federal
authorities; for claims of libel, slander, invasion of privacy, or the
infringement of common law or statutory copyright; for unauthorized use of any
trademark, trade name or service mark; for breach of contractual or other
obligations owing to third parties by the licensee, town, or responsible
educational institution; and for any other injury or damage in law or equity,
which claims result from the use of an access facility or channel.

(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.27 LINE EXTENSION.
   (A)   Residential service. After completion of construction in an area
pursuant to a construction schedule, a licensee shall make cable services
available to dwelling units within the town and shall extend its cable system
as follows:
      (1)   Each unit in a multiple dwelling unit (MDU) shall be counted as a
dwelling unit in determining residential density where a mutually acceptable
agreement granting licensee reasonable access to the MDU has been executed by
the owner of the property and delivered to the licensee. Licensee shall not be
required to make service available to residents of a MDU where the owner of the
property has not granted licensee such reasonable access to the property.
      (2)   When requested by a resident in the town, licensee shall, at
licensee's sole expense, extend the cable system to any single-family residence
or dwelling within the town; provided, that the residence or dwelling is

way, and other property, the installation of underground cable shall be
accomplished in new subdivisions that meet the requirements of division (A)(2)
of this section at the same time, and in the same trench, as other
communications, electric and other permanent services to structures, unless to
do so would be economically infeasible. Except as federal law may grant them
other rights, developers of new residential buildings or mobile homes within a
new or undeveloped subdivision, new residential units within new multiple-
occupancy residential developments, and new commercial and industrial buildings
and structures shall treat cable television facilities as they treat other
communication facilities, utilities and other underground facilities, in
regards to availability and cost of trenching for undergroundings.
      (5)   A license may provide for different line extension requirements
from that required in division (A)(4).
      (6)   Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of circumstances beyond
licensee's reasonable control, an extension of service pursuant to division (A)
(2) of this section or this division shall be accomplished within 120 of the
developer's or resident's request.
      (7)   Licensee shall not be required to install the cable system or
conduit in the joint trench of a new subdivision or to provide cable service to
residents of the subdivision when the developer or homeowner's association of
the subdivision has entered into an agreement in which another party has agreed
to provide cable television or other comparable video services to all residents
of the subdivision and in which the subscribers' fees for such services are
paid to the provider from collection of homeowner's association fees. However,
upon termination of such agreement, the line extension required by this section
shall apply.
   (B)   Commercial service. After completion of construction in an area
pursuant to a construction schedule, a licensee shall make cable services
available to commercial establishments as follows, except licensee shall not be
required to make service available to commercial establishments where the owner
of the property has not granted licensee reasonable access to the property:
      (1)   When requested by the owner of a commercial establishment;
provided, that no plant extension and nothing more than a standard drop is
required to make cable services available; or provided, that the building is
located within 225 feet of the nearest technically feasible point of connection
on the cable system.
      (2)   Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of unusual
circumstances, including without limitation street crossings, an extension of
service shall be accomplished within 120 days of owner's execution of any
necessary easement documents and capital contribution agreements.
      (3)   A license may provide for different line extension requirements
from that required in divisions (B)(1) and (2).
   (C)   Service drops.
      (1)   Licensee shall make service available to any single-family
residence or any commercial establishment within the town at applicable
standard connection charge if the connection requires a standard drop.
      (2)   If making service available requires more than a standard drop,
licensee shall not be required to make such service available unless the person
requesting service pays to licensee (a) the standard connection charge and (b)
an amount equal to the reasonable actual labor and material costs incurred by
licensee for the additional facilities and work.
      (3)   Licensee may offer bulk billing service, but shall not require a
bulk billing agreement as a condition of providing service.
      (4)   Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of unusual
circumstances, including without limitation street crossings, (a) any standard
drop to a single-family residence or dwelling shall be accomplished within 7
business days after an order has been placed, and (b) any drop that is not a
standard drop shall be accomplished within a reasonable time under the
circumstances. Line extensions shall be done as provided in division (A) of
this section.
      (5)   Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of unusual
circumstances, including without limitation street crossings, (a) any standard
drop to a commercial establishment shall be accomplished within 10 days after
the owner of such commercial establishment executes any necessary easement
documents and capital contribution agreements, and (b) any commercial drop that
is not a standard drop shall be accomplished within a reasonable time under the
circumstances.
   (D)   If a licensee elects to extend cable service to a customer in a
licensed area which does not meet the standard drop requirements of this
section, the licensee shall not refuse to extend service to any other customer
in the same area solely on the grounds that service to the first customer did
not meet the standard drop requirements.
   (E)   The line extension requirements set forth in this section shall not
apply to any area covered by a construction phase described in the construction
schedule until the construction phase for that area has been completed.
   (F)   Discrimination prohibited. No person, firm or corporation in the
existing cable service area of the licensee shall be arbitrarily refused cable
services; provided, however, that the licensee shall not be required to provide
cable services to any subscriber who does not pay the applicable line extension
connection fee and/or cable service charge(s).

   (A)   Compliance with construction and technical standards.
      (1)   As provided in the license, licensee shall construct, install,
operate and maintain its system in a manner and at all times consistent with
(a) all laws, this chapter, construction standards of the town, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) Rules and Regulations, Part 76 Subpart K
(Technical Standards), as amended from time to time, and (b) detailed standards
submitted by licensee as part of its application, which standards are to be
incorporated by reference in a license.
      (2)   When there have been multiple, similar complaints by subscribers,
or when there exists other evidence which suggests that licensee is not in
substantial compliance with the technical standards, or the cable system is not
operating in accordance with this chapter or the license, the manager shall
have the right and authority to compel licensee to test, analyze and report on
the performance of the cable system under the supervision of the manager. Such
report shall be delivered to the manager no later than 30 days after the
manager requests such test(s) in writing and shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaints that precipitated the test(s), which
cable system component(s) was/were tested, the equipment used and procedure(s)
employed in such testing, the result(s) of such test(s) and the manner in which
such complaints were resolved. If such report indicates licensee is in partial
compliance with the technical standards, but there exists evidence suggesting
that licensee is nonetheless not in substantial compliance, the manager may
require that the test(s) be repeated within 30 days of the delivery of such
report, under the supervision of a professional engineer not on the permanent
staff of licensee. Such engineer shall sign all records of such repeated test
(s) and shall forward to the manager (a) such records, (b) a report
interpreting the results, and (c) recommended corrective actions, if any. The
fees of such engineer shall be paid by (a) licensee, if the repeated test(s)
show(s) licensee is not in substantial compliance with the technical standards
of this chapter, or (b) the town, if the repeated test(s) show(s) licensee is
in substantial compliance with said standards.
   (B)   Additional specifications. Construction, installation and maintenance
of a cable system shall be performed in an orderly and professional manner. All
cables and wires shall be installed, where possible, parallel with and in a
manner similar to the installation of electric and telephone lines. Multiple
cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel and bundled with due respect
for engineering considerations. Underground installations shall be in
conformance with all applicable codes. Each cable system shall include
equipment capable of providing standby power as specified in the license. The
equipment shall be so constructed as to automatically revert to the standby
mode when the electrical utility power returns. The system shall incorporate
safeguards necessary to prevent injury to technicians resulting from licensee's
standby power sources. Licensee shall at all times comply with applicable
sections of:
      (1)   National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI)C2;
      (2)   National Electrical Code (National Bureau of Fire Underwriters);
      (3)   The International Building Code as may be adopted and amended by

effect or hereinafter adopted by the town;
      (5)   The Maricopa Association of Governments Uniform Standard
Specifications for Public Works Construction including the latest town
supplement thereto.
   (C)   Emergency service. The licensee shall design and construct the system
to provide for a restricted audio override of the audio portion of all channels
during emergencies consistent with FCC regulations. Emergency or standby power

agents and employees other than gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
manager, in any license granted, may waive the requirement for insurance from 1
or more perils mentioned in the last preceding sentence upon a finding that
such insurance cannot be procured or cannot be procured at a reasonable cost,
and in connection therewith may reduce the otherwise required limits on
coverage hereafter set forth. Such policy or policies shall be issued by a
company approved by the manager and shall be in a form approved by the town
attorney, with minimum combined single limits of liability coverage in the
amount of $3,000,000. The policy or policies shall name the town, its officers,
boards, commissions, agents and employees as additional insured and contain a
provision that a written notice of any cancellation, modification or reduction
in coverage of said policy shall be delivered to the Clerk 30 days in advance
of the effective date thereof. No license granted under this chapter shall be
effective unless and until certificates of insurance evidencing coverage
required above are delivered to the Clerk. Any substitute policy or policies
shall be subject to the same approvals and shall comply with all of the
provisions of this division.
      (2)   The Council may require increases in the amount or types of
coverage no more frequently than every 3 years, based on increases in the CPI,
so as to ensure full protection of the town and the public. The licensee shall
have 6 months from the date of notification from the manager to comply with any
increase.
      (3)   A licensee may self-insure the above-described policy coverages if
such licensee or its parent is of sufficient financial standing to reasonably
provide such insurance. A licensee that elects to self-insure shall file with
the town a certificate of insurance as specified by the town.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.49 LETTER OF CREDIT.
   (A)   Within 30 days after the award or renewal of a license, a licensee
shall deposit with the town an irrevocable and replenishable letter of credit
in an amount of $25,000 issued by a federally insured commercial lending
institution. The form and substance of said letter of credit shall be used to
assure the faithful performance by a licensee of all provisions of this and
resulting license; and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of
any agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the town
having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under a license and the payment
by the licensee of any penalties, liquidated damages, claims, liens and taxes
due to the town which arise by reason of the construction, operation or
maintenance of the cable system, including cost of removal or abandonment of
any property of the licensee.
   (B)   The letter of credit may be drawn upon by the town by presentation of
a draft at sight on the lending institution, accompanied by a written
certificate signed by the public works director certifying that the licensee
has been found, pursuant to §
114.52 Administrative Hearing, division (C) or §
114.53 Hearing by Council, to have failed to comply with, its license or
license agreement, stating the nature of noncompliance, and stating the amount
being drawn. Examples of the nature of the noncompliance for drawing upon the
letter of credit include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Failure of the licensee to pay to the town any license fees or
taxes after 10 days written notice of delinquency.
      (2)   Failure of the licensee to pay to the town, after 10 days written
notice, after all judicial remedies have been exhausted, any amounts due and
owing the town by reason of the indemnity provisions of §
114.48 Protection of Town against Liability.
      (3)    Failure of the licensee to pay to the town any liquidated damages
due and owing to the town pursuant to §
114.48 Protection of Town against Liability and/or the license.
   (C)   The letter of credit shall be structured in such a manner so that if
the town at any time draws upon the letter of credit, upon notice to the
licensee by the issuing lending institution, licensee shall increase
immediately the amount of available credit to the extent necessary to replenish
that portion of the available credit exhausted by the honoring of the town's
draft. The lending institution shall notify the town of the replenishment by
licensee. The intent of this paragraph is to make available to the town at all
times a letter of credit in the amount of $25,000.
   (D)   The rights reserved to the town with respect to the letter of credit
are in addition to all other rights of the town, whether reserved by a license
or authorized by law, and no action proceeding against a letter of credit shall
affect any other right the town may have.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.50 CONSTRUCTION BONDS.
   (A)   Thirty days prior to the commencement of any construction in the
town's rights-of-way, a licensee shall obtain and maintain throughout the
period of system construction, at its cost and expense, and file with the
Clerk, a corporate surety bond issued by a company authorized to do business in
the state of Arizona, and found acceptable by the town attorney, in an amount
established in a license agreement solely for the purpose of guaranteeing the
timely construction and/or reconstruction of the cable system and the
safeguarding of private property during construction and/or reconstruction. The
bond shall provide, but not be limited to, the following condition: There shall
be recoverable by the town, jointly and severally from the principal and
surety, any and all damages, losses or costs suffered by the town resulting
from the failure of a licensee to satisfactorily complete construction and/or
reconstruction of its cable system throughout the license area pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this chapter and such licensee's license.
   (B)   Any extension of the prescribed construction or reconstruction time
limit must be authorized by the town. The construction bond shall be available
throughout any such extension period.
   (C)   The construction bond shall be terminated only after the Council finds
that a licensee has satisfactorily completed initial construction and
activation or reconstruction of its cable system pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this chapter and such licensee's license.
   (D)   The rights reserved to the town with respect to the construction bond
are in addition to all other rights of the town, whether reserved by this
chapter or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right
with respect to such construction bond shall affect any other rights the town
may have.
   (E)   (1)   The construction bond shall contain the following endorsement:
      (2)   It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be
canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety
until 60 days after receipt by the town, by registered mail, of written notice
of such intent to cancel or not to renew.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.51 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.
   (A)   Each license granted by the town shall state that a licensee
understands and shall agree that failure to comply with any time and
performance requirements as stipulated in this chapter and the license will
result in damage to the town, and that it is and will be impracticable to
determine the actual amount of such damage caused by delay or nonperformance;
the license shall include provisions for liquidated damages to be paid by the
licensee, in amounts to be negotiated and set forth in the license and
chargeable to the letter of credit for the following defaults:
      (1)   Failure to complete system construction or reconstruction in

system following a written request pursuant to §
114.29 Construction and Technical Standards, division (A)(2);
      (5)   Failure to provide in a continuing manner the type of services
proposed in the accepted application for license or in the final license unless
the Council specifically approves modification of a licensee's obligation;

114.40 Subscriber Service Standards, following notice and an opportunity to
cure pursuant to the provisions of that section; and
      (7)   Any other action or non-action by the licensee, as agreed upon
between the town and licensee, and set forth in the license.
   (B)   If the manager concludes that a licensee is in fact liable for
liquidated damages pursuant to the license, he shall issue to licensee by
certified mail a notice of intention to assess liquidated damages. The notice
shall set forth the nature of the violation and the amount of the proposed
assessment or the licensee shall, within 30 days of receipt of such notice:
      (1)   Respond to the town in writing, contesting the town's assertion of
violation and providing such information or documentation as may be necessary
to support licensee's position; or
      (2)   Cure any such violation (and provide written evidence of the same),
or, if, in the town's sole discretion, such violation cannot be cured within
such 30-day period, take reasonable steps to cure said violation as soon as
practicable and diligently continue such efforts until said violation is cured.
Licensee shall report to the town, in writing, at 30-day intervals as to
licensee's efforts, indicating the steps taken by licensee to cure said
violation and reporting licensee's progress until such violation is cured.
   (C)   If licensee contests the town's assertion of violation or fails to
respond to the town's notice of intent to assess liquidated damages, within 15
days the town shall schedule a hearing in accordance with the procedures set
forth in §
114.52 Administrative Hearing.

shall be a public hearing, and licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to be
heard and to present relevant information.

issue a determination. In that determination the manager may:
      (1)   Find that licensee is not in violation of the terms of the license;

   (D)   If the manager determines that licensee has committed a violation, the
determination shall be accompanied by a detailed statement of reasons for the
determination, including findings of fact.
   (E)   The decision of the manager shall become final unless licensee
requests a public hearing before the Council within 15 days of its receipt of
the statement of reasons and findings of fact by the manager.
(Ord. 16-825, passed 9-13-2016)
§ 114.53 HEARING BY COUNCIL.
   (A)   If a public hearing before the Council is requested by licensee or is
held pursuant to §
114.52 Administrative Hearing, it shall be on the record as supplemented by the
licensee and other relevant information. It shall convene within 30 days of the
request therefor. The Council may designate 3 of its members to act as a
hearing subcommittee in the matter and to present written findings of fact and
conclusions of law to the entire Council. The Council's decision, which shall
include findings of fact, shall be made not later than 45 calendar days after
the conclusion of the hearing. In that decision, the Council may:

under this chapter or otherwise, the Council shall have the right to revoke the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 115.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare
of the citizens of the town, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the town. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (B)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres. Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres
426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glenn Theatre. Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and
on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix,
Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier,
California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of
the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of the sexually oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immuno-deficiency virus infection (HIV AIDS),
genital herpes, hepatitis B. Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) in the United States, 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600
in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   As of November 1, 1997, there have been 5,278 reported cases of
AlDS in the state, and 63 reported cases in Yavapai County, Arizona, 37 of
which have died.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Yavapai County.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than 1 year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view “adult”
oriented films.
      (16)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(15) of this
section raise substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics,
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where the information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of the uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to the activity.
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (24)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (25)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
(2001 Code, § 8-7-1)

§ 150.023 STREET NAMING.
   (A)   A map containing the street and address numbering system for areas
inside the corporate limits of the Town of Chino Valley, 3 copies of which are
on file and available for inspection in the office of the Clerk, is hereby
referred to, adopted and made a part of this subchapter as if fully set out in
this subchapter. All streets and roads within the town shall be named pursuant
to this subchapter in accordance with those names shown on the map described
herein.
   (B)   As far as possible, all streets presently named prior to the adoption
of this subchapter shall retain the same names. The names of future streets may
be assigned by the Zoning Commission from a list of western and local historic
names kept on file when desirable.
   (C)   The following rules shall be followed in assigning future street
names:
      (1)   Duplication of names. There shall be no duplication of street names
in the town limits. Similar sounding names are considered to be duplication
regardless of spelling. Duplication of street names within the City of Prescott
shall be avoided, if possible.
      (2)   Continuity of names. A continuous street, or one proposed to be
continuous, should bear the same name throughout, with the exception of the
suffix, even though it changes directions. If it is interrupted and eventual
connection is not probable, the segments shall bear different names.
      (3)   Guidelines for acceptable names.
         (a)   Names should be pleasant sounding, appropriate, easy to read and
should add to pride of home ownership.
         (b)   Large subdivisions should use a single, significant category of
names. A small subdivision should use the same category as the surrounding or
adjacent area to help establish locational identity.
         (c)   Prefixes are to be avoided, if possible.
         (d)   Suffix terms, including designated quadrant, that may be
utilized for future streets are listed and defined in
§ 150.021.
   (D)   Street name change procedure. Citizens may request street name changes
according to the following procedures:
      (1)   Present to the Zoning Commission a petition stating the desired
change, containing the signatures of 51% by number of the property owners
affected by the change.
      (2)   The Zoning Commission shall formulate an ordinance implementing the
change, and a recommendation on the change, to the Council.
      (3)   The Council may enact the change by adopting the ordinance.
      (4)   The following guidelines shall be considered when renaming streets:
         (a)   Does a street have any historical reason for having the name it
has?
         (b)   Which street has the least number of houses on it and thus would
require the least number of address changes?
         (c)   Which street has had its name for the longest period of time?
         (d)   Is the name appropriate according to the other street names in
the neighborhood?
         (e)   Which street name is used for the longest distance or the most
traveled section?
(2001 Code, § 7-9-4)
§ 150.024 ADDRESS NUMBERS.
   (A)   A “mile” shall be considered the distance between 2 consecutive
section lines. There shall be available 1,000 address numbers per mile. Even
digit numbers shall be used on the west and north sides of the streets, and odd
digit numbers shall be used on the east and south sides of the streets.
   (B)   For the purpose of address numbering on east-west streets, address
numbers shall increase linearly with distance from U.S. Highway 89, the
division line to be the reference meridian with an address number of 0.
   (C)   For the purpose of address numbering on north-south streets, address
numbers shall increase linearly with distance from Center Street, the division
line to be designated the reference meridian with an address number of 0.
   (D)   Each structure of human occupancy or principal building on any
building site to which all other uses on the site are subordinate shall have an
assigned number. Other permanent structures with enclosed floor areas may have
an assigned address number.
   (E)   The following rules shall be followed in assigning address numbers:
      (1)   The intersection of the grid lines should approximately and
reasonably conform to the intersections of existing streets so that a traveler
can observe a distinct change, for instance, from a 300 block to a 400 block.
Where there is no intersection within a long block interval, said block
interval shall be divided between 2 streets at a grid line. Numerical block
interval changes at minor streets should be avoided where the grid does not
indicate a new block.
      (2)   If a street changes direction drastically and for a substantial
length, the numbering should be changed to reflect the orientation with a
different meridian line.
      (3)   The address numbers on parallel streets shall be comparable except
on loops and circles.
      (4)   The numbering shall allow for expansion to accommodate future
growth in the area.
      (5)   Each location where business is conducted or mail is received shall
have an address number.
      (6)   Address numbers shall be assigned to correspond with the
predominant direction of the loop or circle. The address number assignment
shall begin with the corner nearest the appropriate meridian line and continue
around the loop in a regular manner with even numbers on the inside and odd
numbers on the outside.
      (7)   The general principle to apply when numbering diagonal streets is
to treat the street as either a north-south or an east-west street if it is not
a perfect diagonal. If it is a perfect diagonal, an arbitrary decision is made
to treat it as a north-south or an east-west street, maintaining consistency in
neighboring areas.
      (8)    When assigning a number to a building on a corner lot, assign a
number from the street upon which the front entrance faces. Dual addresses
shall be avoided. If a corner building has two entrances which both look like
front entrances, the decision is based on the general site layout. If the
direction a corner structure is facing is indeterminate, consider the street
from which the number should be most readily identified as the street upon
which the structure faces.
      (9)   Apartments, rooms and offices contained within any structure or
complex shall have an assigned address number based on an intersection point
with a street. The owner of the structure or complex shall be responsible for
assignment of appropriate numbers within the structure or complex.
      (10)   Separate numbers should be assigned to the entrances of a duplex
house, for an upstairs apartment which has an outside entrance or for separate
buildings in the rear of other buildings. If a commercial enterprise that is
part of a residence has a separate entrance from the street, it may also be
assigned a separate number. The owner of the duplex shall be responsible for
the assignment of appropriate numbers to the buildings.
      (11)   Each mobile home park shall have an assigned address number based
on an intersection point with a street which shall include appropriate space
numbers for each space within the park. The mobile home park owner shall be
responsible for the space numbering within the park.
      (12)   The same address number is assigned for all lots and units with
primary access from a private drive or private easement based upon point of
intersection with a public thoroughfare. All lots and units shall further be
assigned a lot/space number as part of the address.
      (13)   Rear houses and buildings hidden but plainly subsidiary or
auxiliary to a separate front unit and sharing the same vehicular entry shall
be assigned the next number in sequence to the front or main structure.
   (F)   Posting of designated address numbers.
      (1)   The owner, occupant or person in charge of any house or building to
which an address number and street name has been assigned will be notified in
writing by the town of the number assigned to the same. Within 60 days after
the receipt of such written notification from the Zoning Commission, the owner,
occupant or person in charge of a house or building to which a number has been
assigned shall affix the number in a conspicuous manner in a conspicuous place.
      (2)   It is the duty of the owner, occupant or person in charge thereof,
upon affixing the new number, to remove any different number which might be
mistaken for or confused with the number assigned to the structure by the
Zoning Commission.
      (3)   Numerals indicating the official numbers for each principal
building or each front entrance to the building shall be posted in a manner as
to be legible and distinguishable from the street on which the property is
located according to the following standards:
         (a)   House numbers shall be large enough to be seen easily from the
street.
         (b)   House numbers shall be set on a background of a contrasting
color.
         (c)   When a house is some distance from a road or when view of the
house is blocked by trees or shrubs, house numbers shall be on a sign attached
to a tree, fence, gate or lawn stake.
         (d)   On a corner lot, the house number shall face the street named in
the address.
         (e)   House numbers shall be easily visible at night.
         (f)   House numbers shall be plain block numerals, not script or
written numbers and a minimum 5 inches in height.
      (4)   Mobile home parks and other group housing served by private drives
or easements are assigned an address number based on the intersection point on
a street, and the point shall be posted with numerals giving that address
number and the range of lot numbers served by the easement. Additionally, the
structure on the easement having an address number shall post the designation
“Lot_____” according hereto.

by the Finance Director and reviewed by the Town Manager, shall then be fixed
by the Finance Director based upon such calculation, without the necessity of
further action by the Council. In no event shall the amount of the development
impact fees be reduced based upon a change in the ENR Index. No later than 30
days after the development impact fees are adjusted each year as provided in
this section, the Town Clerk shall cause to be published a public notice
setting forth the amount of the adjusted development impact fees. The notice
shall be published 1 time in a newspaper of general circulation in the town,
provided, however, that the failure of the Town Clerk to cause the notice to be
published shall not affect the validity of the adjustment to the development
impact fees as made by the Finance Director pursuant to this section. In the
event the ENR Index information for the prior calendar years is unavailable by
April 1, the development impact fees as previously fixed for the prior fiscal
year (July 1 to June 30) shall continue in effect until such time as the ENR
Index for the prior years is available and the finance director makes the
required calculation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the State of Arizona has, in A.R.S. § 48-3610, enabled
the Town of Chino Valley to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-
3609 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Chino Valley are subject to
periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in special flood hazard areas, which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in special flood hazard areas;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   To participate and maintain eligibility for state and federal disaster
relief.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOOD PROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to nonresidential structures which reduce or eliminate
risk of flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and
sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents by means other than
elevation.
   FLOOD-RELATED EROSION. The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of
a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or
an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas necessary in order to discharge the 100-year flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. Also
referred to a REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
REGULATORY FLOODWAY where encroachment may be permitted.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term

152.068, meaning the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to
grant the requested variance. The council requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that the
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term

which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement
of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by
reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building
construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking
into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain Administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or
accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized
building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are
included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and

(NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, structures for which
the START OF CONSTRUCTION commenced on or after June 18, 1975. For the purposes
of determining insurance rates, structures for which the START OF CONSTRUCTION
commenced on or after the effective date of an initial flood insurance rate map
or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, NEW
CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the START OF CONSTRUCTION commenced on
or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a

the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.

alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
HISTORIC STRUCTURE.
   VARIANCE. Means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic

Insurance Study for Yavapai County, Arizona, and Incorporated Areas," dated
September 3, 2010 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated September
3, 2010 and subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. These flood insurance
studies are on file at the town's Community Development Department and public
library. The flood insurance study and attendant mapping is the minimum area of
applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other
areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to
the floodplain board by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   The Floodplain Board, within its area of jurisdiction, shall delineate
(or may, by rule, require developers of land to delineate) for areas where

      (2)   All required state and federal permits have been obtained;
      (3)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
      (4)   In areas where a floodway has not been designated, the proposed
development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base
flood elevations have been determined; and
      (5)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the water and
sediment carrying capacity of the floodway. For purposes of this chapter,
"adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, and all other existing and anticipated developments shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at
any point, and shall not risk aggravating bed and bank scour which could
directly or indirectly endanger human life or cause property damage.

structures on slopes guide floodwaters around and away from proposed or
existing structures.
   (C)   Elevation and flood-proofing.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
the regulatory flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the
elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a
registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure in Zone AO shall have the lowest floor, including basement, higher
than the highest adjacent grade at least one foot higher than the depth number
on the FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. Upon the
completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including
basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor
and provided to the Floodplain Administrator that the elevation of the
structure meets this standard.

non-residential structures or fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor, that
are useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be designed or certified by a registered engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters, as certified by the owner's engineer.
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the above standards and also the
standards in §
152.049.
      (6)   Fill, if used to elevate structures, must meet all of the following
standards:

to the channel of any watercourse; and
         (e)   Fill proposed in excess of the volume and extent required herein
must be shown to have no detrimental effect and the amount of fill cannot be
greater than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is intended as
demonstrated by a plan submitted by the applicant indicating the uses to which
the filled land will be put and the final dimensions and extent of the proposed
fill. Fill shall not include junk, trash, wood or other buoyant or hazardous
material and shall be protected as needed against scour and erosion by riprap
or other protective measures as approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.046 STANDARDS FOR STORAGE OF MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   The storage or processing of materials that could be injurious to
human, animal or plant life if released due to damage from flooding is
prohibited in special flood hazard areas.
   (B)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject
to major damage by floods, and if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.047  STANDARDS FOR WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS.
   (A)   All new or replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system and discharge from systems into flood waters.
   (B)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (C)   Waste disposal systems shall not be installed wholly or partially in a
regulatory floodway.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.048 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   All new subdivision proposals and other proposed development
(including proposals for mobile home parks or subdivisions) greater than 50
lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall:
      (1)   Identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood;
and
      (2)   For all final subdivision plans and plats, provide the elevation(s)
of proposed structure(s) and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood,
the final lowest floor and pad elevation shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water

include the information, and shall be in the form required by the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.049 STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
   (A)   All new and replacement manufactured homes and additions to
manufactured homes shall:
      (1)   Be elevated so that the bottom of the structural frame or the
lowest point of any attached appliances, whichever is lower, is at or above the
regulatory flood elevation; and
      (2)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
designed by a registered professional engineer, to resist flotation, collapse

152.030 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in
division (A)(2) of this section.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.050 FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within special flood hazard areas established in §
152.007 are areas designated as floodways.
   (B)   Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   (a)   Encroachments in floodways are prohibited, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless
certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels and that
the structural integrity of the development is not susceptible to the base
flood velocities, bed scour and other physical mechanisms during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge; and
         (b)   The certified demonstration must meet the procedures as set
forth in §
152.030, and if approved by the Floodplain Administrator a development permit
may be obtained.
      (2)   (a)   The minimum setback from the edge of a floodway, or from the
edge of a bank of a watercourse if no floodway is to be defined, shall be 20
feet; and
         (b)   Along reaches of streams or watercourses where hazards from
eroding banks and/or channel meandering are considered by the district
administrator to be severe, special engineering studies shall be made by the
property owner or developer and requirements for setbacks from banks of streams
or watercourses and/or other protection measures shall be established in
accordance with findings that are concurred with by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (3)   No activity is permitted within a floodway that might cause lateral
migration of waters at high or low stages or channel bed degradation or
aggradation without a development permit.
      (4)   If §
152.050 is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
152.045 et seq.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 152.065 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in §§
152.065 through
152.068 are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain
to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be
granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that
complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional
hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The
characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the
structure, its inhabitants or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the Town Council to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious
that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this
chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.066 APPEAL BOARD.
   (A)   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   In considering such applications, the Floodplain Board shall consider
all technical evaluations, including an opinion of the Town Engineer, all
relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing §§
152.030 and
152.045 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (E)   Upon consideration of the factors of §§
152.065 et seq. and the purposes of this chapter, the Floodplain Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.067 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration
of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   (B)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of, the
public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   The construction below the regulatory flood elevation increases
risks to life and property.
   (F)   The notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions as required in § 152.065(E). The notice will also state that the land
upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of land
pursuant to any flood relocation and land exchange program. A copy of the
notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Board in the office of the Yavapai
County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the
chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
(Ord. 2019-863, passed 1-8-2019)
§ 152.068 MINOR VARIANCES.
   The Floodplain Board may identify uses which are not allowed by this chapter
but which are minor in nature. The Floodplain Board may adopt written policies
detailing specific conditions in addition to the conditions listed in §
152.066 under which minor variances may be granted. The Floodplain
Administrator may grant minor variances if all necessary conditions have been
satisfied. The denial of a minor variance may be appealed to the Floodplain
Board.

conditions or engineering error. Any person may submit engineering reports
consistent with criteria developed by the Director of the Arizona Department of
Water Resources to demonstrate error. The Floodplain Administrator may submit
any proposed changes to the Arizona Department of Water Resources and the
Federal Insurance Administration, including supporting engineering.
   (B)   Where areas of special flood hazard have not been delineated and
development is ongoing or imminent, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
direct the Floodplain Administrator or developers of land to prepare and submit
reports to the Floodplain Administrator. If it appears that the report(s) are
consistent with the criteria developed by the Director of the Arizona
Department of Water Resources, they shall be adopted and submitted to the
Arizona Department of Water Resources and the Federal Insurance Administration.

§ 155.01 PURPOSE.
   Inasmuch as it is often in the public interest to extend public capital
improvements or infrastructure to undeveloped areas in the town, or for one
development to size certain public capital improvements or infrastructure
larger than would otherwise be necessary for the development itself (so as to
better accommodate nearby development), the Town Manager or his or her designee
is hereby authorized to specify that developers either extend certain
improvements off-site to connect with existing improvements or “upsize” certain
on-site or off-site improvements (at developer’s cost) so as to facilitate
connection thereto by other developments.
(Ord. 05-627, passed 10-27-2005)
§ 155.02 AGREEMENTS OPTIONAL.
   In the event the Town Manager or his or her designee specifies such
extensions of off-site improvements or such upsizing of on-site or off-site
improvements, nothing herein shall preclude the town from entering into
agreements with developers to reimburse from buy-in fees charged to other
developers over time some or all of the additional costs involved. However, it
is expressly understood that nothing herein requires the town to enter into
such agreements where the requirement of such extensions or upsizing at
developer’s sole cost is justified by significant other benefits accruing to
developers, or as a consequence of development agreements, or as consideration
for zoning, development plan, or site approvals or for other appropriate
reasons. Developers shall pay the costs of the assessment process to determine
the reasonable buy-in fee to charge other developers who use or connect to the
improvement, including, without limitation, consultant fees to prepare studies,
such as traffic, water, and sewer studies.
(Ord. 05-627, passed 10-27-2005)
§ 155.03 FORM OF AGREEMENTS.
   Any agreements to reimburse some or all costs of off-site improvements
extensions or upsizing of on-site or off-site improvements extension shall
address one or more of the following:
   (A)   Whether or not the improvement must be competitively bid in accordance
with A.R.S. § 34-201;
   (B)   When and according to what processes the improvement becomes the
property of the town;
   (C)   Whether and to what extent any improvement district assessments, in-
lieu of assessment fees, connection charges, or development fees charged to
developers will be offset by the extra costs of the improvement incurred by
developers;
   (D)   Whether and to what extent developers shall be reserved a specific
amount of capacity in the improvement;
   (E)   The amount of reimbursable costs, after accounting for any offsets for
the extra costs to developers (and any capacity in the improvement reserved to
developers) and for capacity in the improvement that will remain available for
use or connection by the other developers (for which developers should be
reimbursed). Engineering costs may be included as reimbursable costs;
   (F)   The reasonable buy-in fee to charge other developers who use or
connect to the improvement;
   (G)   How such buy-in fees shall be paid to the town and repaid to
developers after deduction of a reasonable administrative fee by the town;
   (H)   That the total of such repayments shall not exceed the amount
established in §
155.03(E) above and may be less if sufficient buy-in fees are not collected
during the term of the agreement;
   (I)   That the term of any such agreement shall not be longer than 10 years
or when the amount set forth in §
155.03(E) above is reimbursed (whichever is earlier);
   (J)   That the town has the option to reimburse developers with a credit
against development fees, connection charges, improvement district assessments,
or in lieu of assessment fees imposed by the town (in which case the town shall
reimburse the appropriate fund accounts with the applicable buy-in fees
collected);
   (K)   How and under what circumstances the agreement may be assigned to
successors-in-interest;
   (L)   That such agreements shall be recorded in the office of the Yavapai
County Recorder.
(Ord. 05-627, passed 10-27-2005)
§ 155.04 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All required extensions of off-site improvements or upsizing of on-site or
off-site improvements shall be constructed in accordance with specifications
approved by the Town Engineer. Upon approval and acceptance of said extensions
or upsized improvements by the Town Engineer, the same shall be dedicated by
appropriate instrument to the town, and the town shall exercise exclusive
control over who may connect or use the same and the procedures therefor.
(Ord. 05-627, passed 10-27-2005)
§ 155.05 OFFSET.
   Buy-in fees paid by other developers as a result of such reimbursement
agreements with developers may be offset, in whole or in part, against any
development fees, connection charges, improvement district assessments, or in
lieu of assessment fees charged those other developers for such improvements.
(Ord. 05-627, passed 10-27-2005)
§ 155.06 DEVELOPER.
   A developer is defined as an individual, firm, corporation, association,

on the proposal, and adhere to the posting and publication requirements
required by Arizona law, including compliance with the Citizen Review Process
provided in Section 1.9.5, prior to the public hearing before the Planning and

adjacent in the rear or any side extending 150 feet therefrom, or those
directly opposite extending 150 feet from the street frontage of opposite lots,
file a protest in writing against a proposed ordinance amendment, such
amendment shall not become effective except by favorable vote of three-fourths
of the Council. If any member of Council is unable to vote because of a
conflict of interest, then the required number of votes shall be three-fourths
of the remaining Council members (provided that required number of votes shall
not be less than a majority of the full Council). Written protests must be

1.9.5 CITIZEN REVIEW PROCESS
Prior to any public hearing, as required under this Ordinance, on any
application for any ordinance that changes any property from one zoning
district to another, a use or Conditional Use Permit application that imposes
any regulation not previously imposed, or that removes or modifies any such
regulation previously imposed, the Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee,
shall require the applicant to conduct a neighborhood meeting or an acceptable
alternative prior to a public hearing to consider the proposal. A written
notice of the application shall be mailed to all landowners of property within
three hundred (300) feet of the property that is subject to a rezone, Use or
Conditional Use Permit application and to such other persons as the Zoning
Administrator, or his/her designee, reasonably determines to be other
potentially affected citizens. In determining the number of potentially
affected citizens, the Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee, shall review
the density and intensity of residential development in the general vicinity,
the existing street system, and other factors that may be related to the zoning
or Use Permit’s impact on the character of the neighborhood.
The written notice shall also include a general explanation of the substance of
the proposed Rezoning, Use Permit application and shall state the date, time
and place scheduled for a neighborhood meeting, at which any adjacent landowner
(s) or those other potentially affected citizens, will be provided a reasonable
opportunity to express any issues or concerns that the landowner or citizen may
have with the proposed zoning or use permit application before any required
public hearing.
The written notice shall be given at least fifteen (15) days before the
neighborhood meeting in the following manner:
The notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation
published or circulated in the Town.
The notice shall be posted upon the sign required in this Ordinance, unless
waived by the Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee.
The notice shall be mailed in accordance with the same procedures as required
in, and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance.
The applicant, upon consultation with the Zoning Administrator, shall establish
a time, date and place for the neighborhood meeting that provides a reasonable
opportunity for the applicant to inform adjacent landowners and other
potentially affected citizens of the substance of the proposed action and
adjacent landowners and other potentially affected citizens will be provided an
opportunity to express any issues or concerns that they may have with the
proposed zoning or change of zoning or Use Permit proposed by the application
before the public hearing. The citizen review meeting shall be held not less
than five days prior to the public hearing on the application. The Zoning
Administrator, or his/her designee, may attend the meeting, but is not required
to conduct the meeting. The applicant, or his/her designee, shall submit a
written report of the outcomes of the meeting, to the Zoning Administrator, who
shall include them in reports to Commission and Town Council at such time as
they take action on the application.
At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee, an
alternative citizen review process may be used that does not involve a
neighborhood meeting. The alternative process shall consist, at a minimum, of
the following:
Written notice as described above, except that the notice shall only indicate
the name, address and phone number of the member of the planning staff to whom
adjacent landowners within three hundred (300) feet or other potentially
affected citizen, may contact to express any issues or concerns that the
landowner or citizen may have with the proposed rezoning.
A staff report summarizing any issues or concerns expressed by adjacent
landowners shall be presented to the Commission and Mayor and Council at such
time as they take action on the application.

facts to allow the Zoning Administrator to make an individualized determination
of the recovery residence’s needs, to address the Town’s safety and welfare

requirements of the federal and state fair housing laws, public safety and

poses a hazard to either pedestrians or vehicles, or in such a manner to
confuse, distract, or interfere with traffic and/or pedestrians.
D.   Signs shall be located a minimum of six feet (6') from property lines.
E.   All signs and sign structures, conforming and non-conforming, shall be

F.   All illuminated signs shall comply with Section
4.24 Outdoor Lighting including, but not limited to, Subsection
4.24.4 General Requirements, Subsection (P).

located shall be no further than 1/4 mile from SR 89.
2.   The business owner shall obtain permission pursuant to a non-revocable

fronting on SR 89, granting the off-site business the right to construct a new
freestanding sign on the commercial property or to add the off- site business
nameplate to an existing freestanding or monument sign. If no existing
freestanding or monument sign exists, a new sign may be constructed to provide
signage for the onsite businesses with additional nameplates for off-site
signage opportunities; provided, that any signage on such new freestanding or
monument sign shall be calculated as part of the total allowable signage for
each business.
3.   The non-revocable license granted by the owner of the commercial property

removed. The license shall be valid for the time period stated and shall not be
terminated if the underlying property or the related business is sold during
that time period.
4.   Off-site signage shall require a sign permit. The signature of the owner
of the commercial property fronting on SR 89 on which the sign is proposed
shall be required on the application. A copy of the signed license shall be
submitted as part of the application.
5.   Off-site signage shall conform to all other aspects of permanent signage
as defined in Section
4.21 of this Chapter (i.e., freestanding, monument, etc.).
6.   Off-site signage shall not be allowed on vacant property.
7.   The business requesting off-site signage shall be required to have a

footage of the off-site signage shall be deducted from the total allowable
signage of that type on the site the business is located.
8.   No temporary or auxiliary off-site signage shall be permitted; such
signage shall only be allowed on the property on which the business is located.
9.   All off-site signage shall comply with the Outdoor Lighting ordinance

4.21.4 MEASUREMENT OF SIGNS
A.   Sign Area shall be measured as follows:
1.   Sign copy mounted or painted on a background panel or area distinctively
painted, textured or constructed as a background for the sign copy shall be
measured as that area within the outside dimensions of the background panel or
surface.
2.   Sign copy mounted as individual letters and/or graphics against a wall or
parapet of a building or other structure that has not been painted, textured,
or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy
shall be measured as a sum of the smallest rectangles that will enclose each
word and each graphic in the total sign copy.
3.   Multi-face signs shall be measured as follows:
a.   A two (2) faced sign shall be considered as one sign when determining the
sign area, provided both faces are parallel or the interior angle between the
two (2) sign faces is sixty degrees (60º) or less. If the interior angle is
greater than sixty degrees (60º), the sign area shall be the sum of the area of
the two (2) faces.
b.   Where a sign has three (3) or more faces: the area of the sign shall be
calculated as fifty percent (50%) of the sum of the area of all faces.

c.   Where a sign is a spherical, free form, sculptural, figurative or other
non-planar sign, the sign area shall be fifty (50%) percent of the sum of the
area of the sides of the smallest polyhedron that will encompass the
sign structure.
B.   Sign Height.
1.   Sign height shall be measured as follows.
a.   Freestanding sign height shall be the vertical distance from the top of
the highest element of the sign or sign structure to ground level. The monument
base or other structure erected to support or ornament the sign shall be
included as part of the sign height.
b.   When a freestanding sign is located below the average grade of an
adjacent roadway "ground level" shall be measured from the average grade of the
adjacent roadway.
c.   Wall or parapet-mounted sign height shall be the vertical distance to the
top of the sign or sign structure from the base of the wall on which the sign
is located.

owns or has otherwise available for their use, sufficient property to provide
required parking.
B.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL SPACES.
1.   All vehicular egress from parking lots to public right-of-way shall be by
forward motion only, except in the case of single-family and two-family
residences fronting on a local street or a primary or secondary collector
street.
2.   New construction and conversion of a residence to a commercial use:
subject to the provisions contained in this subsection B., all required parking
and loading spaces, maneuvering areas, driveways, and fire lanes shall be paved
with asphaltic concrete over an A.B. base, concrete or masonry to a thickness
and structure that will support the type and intensity of vehicular traffic
generated by the proposed use. As the requirements may vary the paving cross
section will require approval by the Town Engineer. The Town Engineer may also
approve alternative surfacing such as “chip seal”.
3.   Additions to existing structures: whenever an addition to an existing
structure is proposed that enlarges the existing structure by fifty (50)
percent or more then the above requirements in paragraph 2. above shall apply.
4.   Change of use in an existing commercial  building: the applicant shall
provide a site plan indicating that the parking area is of sufficient size and
adequate dimension to provide any additional parking that the new use may be
required to provide in accordance with the requirements of this code. Whenever
a change of use occurs the owner is encouraged to provide a dust free surface
such as decomposed granite over the entire area that is dedicated to the
required parking and maneuvering area and driveways.

passed 1-11-2011)
4.22.5 PARKING STANDARDS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USES
In case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street parking space
shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
A.   MAINTENANCE.
It shall be the joint and separate responsibility of the lessee and owner of
the principal use, uses or building to maintain in a neat and adequate manner,
the parking space, access ways, striping, landscaping, and required fences or
screening.
B.   PARKING AREA IMPROVEMENTS.
For multiple-family residential, commercial , industrial and PAD districts, the
following shall apply:
1.   Parking areas shall be screened from street view and residential
development by a berm and/or wall (minimum of three (3) feet in height), with
landscaping.
2.   Except where a wall is required, a minimum six (6) inch high curb or
permanently attached or affixed bumper guard shall be constructed so that no
part of a vehicle extends beyond the property line.
C.   ACCESS.
Off-street parking space shall be connected with a public street by a paved
driveway that affords safe and reasonably convenient ingress and egress. The
minimum width of driveways shall be forty (40) feet if ingress and egress are
the same. If ingress and egress are by separate drives, then the minimum width
of each drive shall be twenty (20) feet.
D.   PARKING SPACE LOCATION.
All required parking spaces for non-residential or mixed uses shall be located
on the lot upon which the use is located or on an adjacent lot. Required
parking spaces for multiple-family, commercial or industrial use may be located
on an adjacent lot in another district (other than in a single-family
residential district).
E.   JOINT USE PARKING FOR PAD.
If an applicant for a mixed use PAD can demonstrate through a parking study
supplied by the applicant and approved by the Development Services Director, or
his/her designee, that the peak parking demand for the mixed uses will be less
than the sum of the parking spaces required for each use served, a reduction in
spaces may be allowed.
1.   The approved joint use parking plan shall specify the typical hours of
operation with anticipated periods of greatest parking demand for all uses
within the development; and shall indicate the number, location and convenience
of pedestrian access of all spaces available to serve each use.
2.   The joint use parking plan shall remain on file with the Development
Services Department  for the purpose of monitoring the continuing adequacy of
available parking.
3.   At the time of joint use parking plan approval, or at any subsequent time
when uses, intensities of use or hours of operation, may be expanded or
otherwise change, or upon findings that the parking facilities are inadequate,
the Development Services Director, or his/her designee, may require additional
site area to be provided, and as necessary improved, to supply additional
parking facilities.
(Ord. 06-678, passed 11-9-2006)

pavement edge, or street curb where no sidewalk exists; nor shall any such
vehicle be parked within the area formed by a ten-foot by ten-foot (10 x 10)
triangle as measured from the point of intersection of the back of the
sidewalk, or street curb where no sidewalk exists, and a side property line
extended to the back of the sidewalk, or street curb where no sidewalk exists,

of the space shall consider:
A.   Minimum standards for parking space allocation shall be subject to the
requirements of this Ordinance.
B.   The maximum number of parking spaces provided shall not exceed the minimum
number of spaces and an additional twenty (20) percent of parking spaces,
except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance.

major access drives providing access from the major street, major circulation
drives forming circulation through the parking area, and parking aisles whose
purpose is to provide access to parking spaces.
D.   Reciprocal access between adjacent commercial developments is required.
E.   Large parking lots shall be divided into a series of smaller lots of
approximately one hundred-fifty (150) spaces each, using raised landscape
island(s) at least ten (10) feet in width, and at least five hundred (500)
square feet in total area, located along the sides of the parking areas to
separate large parking areas. Walkways should be considered as part of these
landscape areas. Raised landscape strips at least five (5) feet wide and at
least ninety-five (95) square feet in total area, should be located on the ends
of parking rows, extending the full length of parking spaces. Additional
landscape islands should be considered in the interior of the individual
parking areas to provide shade and break up large expanses of parking area.

number of parking spaces may be increased by ten (10) percent, above the
maximum, however in no case may the total number of parking spaces be increased
by more than forty (40) percent above the base maximum allowed.
I.   In the case of fractional results in calculating parking requirements, the
required number shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number if the fraction
is 0.5 or greater.
J.   All uses not specifically designated, or similar to a specified use, shall
have parking space requirements determined by the Zoning Administrator.
K.   Handicapped parking spaces: in multiple-family, commercial (excluding
health care uses), and industrial districts, handicapped parking spaces shall
be provided at the ratio of one (1) space for the first twenty (20) parking
spaces provided, and one (1) space every twenty five (25) thereafter.
L.   Handicapped parking spaces ratio for health care uses shall be as
following:
 
1 - 10 Spaces  Require 1 HC Space
11 - 20 Spaces Require 2 HC Spaces
21 - 30 Spaces Require 3 HC Spaces
31 - 50 Spaces Require 4 HC Spaces
51 - 75 Spaces Require 5 HC Spaces

4.23 PUBLIC STREET SYSTEM AND PUBLIC USE ACCESS SYSTEM
A.   PURPOSE
The purpose of this subsection is to regulate the dedication and classification
of public streets, rights-of-way and access ways, and to ensure the orderly
growth of the public street system of Chino Valley.
B. STREET CLASSIFICATION
All streets within the corporate limits of the Town are designated as arterial,
collector, or residential streets.
1.   Street classifications.
a.   Arterial streets shall generally carry through traffic and, unless part of
the state highway system, shall be the responsibility of the Town to maintain.
b.   Collector streets shall generally carry traffic from residential
neighborhoods to arterial streets or major destination points such as
industrial or commercial centers. Except as required by a subdivision plat,
collector streets shall be the responsibility of the Town to maintain.
c.   Residential streets shall carry traffic from residential lots to collector
streets. The Town bears no responsibility to construct residential streets, or
maintain such streets unless they have been built to Town standards and
formally accepted for maintenance.
2.   Street classification amendment procedure.
a.   All petitions for street classification amendment shall be presented to
the Zoning Administrator and Road Department Supervisor for their evaluation
and recommendation.
b.   The recommendations of the Zoning Administrator and Road Department
Supervisor, together with the petition, shall be forwarded to the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
Thereafter, the procedures set forth in the Chino Valley Unified Development
Ordinance shall be followed.
3.   No new residential street shall be added to the public street system
except as governed by the Subdivision Ordinance of the Town.
C.   INCLUSION IN THE PUBLIC USE ACCESS SYSTEM FOR PRE-EXISTING ACCESS WAYS AND
INCLUSION IN THE PUBLIC STREET SYSTEM
Any person may petition for inclusion of a pre-existing access way into the
public use access system. Any person may also petition for inclusion of a
right-of-way or non-conforming right-of-way into the public street system. The
Council or Commission may petition for inclusion of a new collector or arterial
street into the public street system.
D.   INCLUSION IN THE PUBLIC STREET SYSTEM FOR NEW COLLECTOR OR ARTERIAL
STREETS
E.   RIGHT-OF-WAY DEDICATION
1.   Right-of-way dedication s as required by this Ordinance, or otherwise
offered to or solicited by the Town, are for the purpose of acquiring full
public ownership for the public street system. Recording of such right-of-
way dedication s in no way implies acceptance of any roadway for maintenance.
2.   All right-of-way dedication s shall be offered to the Zoning Administrator
on forms specified by the Town.
3.   The Zoning Administrator and Public Works Director shall, within five (5)
working days from the date of the application, determine the correctness of the
proposed dedication as to size and alignment.
4.   Upon a favorable ruling the proposed dedication shall be recorded with the
Town and the County Recorder.
5.   In no case shall right-of-way or public street of the public use access
system, as required by this UDO, be considered as creating non-conforming lots
or prevent such lots from legally being split as otherwise governed in this UDO
due to loss of area as a result of such requirements.
F.   APPLICATIONS FOR MAINTENANCE
1.   Upon construction of a roadway on any residential right-of-way to Town
standards as specified in the Town Code. Whether by improvement district or
through subdivision regulations, the governing body of the improvement district
or developer for the subdivision may apply to the Town for acceptance of the
roadway for maintenance and the acceptance of the dedicated right-of-way.
2.   All such applications for maintenance shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator on forms specified by the Town and accompanied by a filing fee.
3.   The application shall be placed on the Town Council agenda within fifteen
(15) working days of the application, accompanied by the recommendations of the
Zoning Administrator and Road Department Supervisor.
4.   Upon favorable vote of the Town Council, the roadway, along with all
dedications recorded according to this Ordinance, shall be accepted by
resolution for maintenance as a public street. The acceptance of the dedicated
right-of-way shall be accomplished by the appropriate legal party signing the
recording of the required document.
5.   For lots with a zoning classification of one (1) acre or greater,
dedications of right-of-way or public streets of the public use access system,
as required by this UDO, shall not be considered to create non-conforming lots
from legally being split as otherwise governed in the UDO due to loss of area
as a result of such dedication.
G.   RESERVED
H.   FUTURE RIGHT-OF-WAY
Town Council shall adopt a map of future rights-of-way desired by the Town.
This map shall depict the roads which are not dedicated rights-of-way and which
are commonly used for access to lots or subdivisions, as well as dedicated
rights-of-way not accepted for maintenance. These are known as the public use
access system. The map shall also show additions to the rights-of-way the Town
currently owns which may be needed for future street/widening or other
purposes. The Future right-of-way Map shall be used to implement this
Ordinance.
I.   PUBLIC USE ACCESS SYSTEM
The map adopted by the Town shall depict the public use access system of the
Town as of the effective date of the adoption of this amendment.
1.   The public use access system designates all existing right-of-way being
used for vehicular access by local residents but which do not conform to all
the public street requirements including, but not limited to, conformance with
this Ordinance.
2.   The public use access system includes all existing access ways being used
for vehicular access by local residents but which do not conform to all the
public street requirements including, but not limited to, lack of right-of-way
and conformance with this Ordinance.
3.   It is the intent of this Ordinance to perfect the public use access system
and ensure the future development of a public street system.
4.   The public use access system is part of the Future right-of-way System.
The Town does not represent the streets of this system as necessarily public or
accepted for maintenance at the date of this amendment, but recognizes that
they exist as vehicular access for general public use.

4.24 OUTDOOR LIGHTING
INTENT AND PURPOSE:
It is the intent of these regulations to encourage lighting practices and
systems which will: minimize light pollution, glare, light trespass; conserve
energy and resources while maintaining night time safety, utility, security,
and productivity; and curtail the degradation of the night time visual
environment.
APPLICABILITY
A.   NEW USES, BUILDINGS AND ADDITIONS: All proposed new land uses,
developments, buildings, structures, or building additions of twenty-five (25)
percent or more in terms of additional dwelling unit s, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein, either with a
single addition or cumulative additions subsequent to the effective date of
this Ordinance, shall meet the requirements herein for the entire property.
This includes additions, which increase the total number of required parking
spaces by twenty-five (25) percent or more. For all building additions of less
than twenty- five (25) percent cumulative, the applicant shall only have to
meet the requirements of this Ordinance for any new outdoor lighting provided.
B.   CHANGE OF USE/INTENSITY: Except as provided in Paragraph C. below,
whenever the use of any existing building, structure, or premises is changed to
a new use, or the intensity of use is increased through the incorporation of
additional dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units
of measurement specified herein, and which change of use or intensification of
use creates a need for an increase in the total number of parking spaces of
twenty-five (25) percent or more, either with a single change or cumulative
changes subsequent to the effective date of this Ordinance, then all outdoor
lighting facilities shall meet the requirements herein for the entire property,
to the maximum extent possible as determined by the Zoning Administrator. For
changes of use or intensity which require an increase in parking of less than
twenty-five (25) percent cumulative, the applicant shall only have to meet the
requirements of this Ordinance for any new outdoor lighting provided.
C.   NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES OR LOTS: Whenever a non-conforming use,
structure or lot is abandoned for a period of six (6) months and then changed
to a new use according to the requirements of this Ordinance, then any existing
outdoor lighting shall be reviewed and brought into compliance as necessary for
the entire building, structure or premises, to the maximum extent possible as
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
APPROVED MATERIALS AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION OR INSTALLATION/OPERATION:
A.   Preferred Source - Low-pressure Sodium (LPS) lamps are the preferred
illumination source throughout the Town; their use is to be encouraged, when
not required, for outdoor illumination whenever its use would not be
detrimental to the use of the property.
B.   The provisions of this Ordinance are not intended to prevent the use of
any design, material, or method of installation or operation not specifically
pre-scribed herein, provided any such alternate has been approved by the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may approve any such proposed alternate
provided he/she finds that it:
1.   Provides at least approximate equivalence to the applicable specific
requirements of this Ordinance; and
2.   Is otherwise satisfactory and complies with the intent of this Ordinance.
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
A.   Outdoor floodlighting by flood light projection above the horizontal plane
is prohibited.
B.   All light fixtures that are required to be shielded shall be installed in
such a manner that the shielding is effective.
C.   All light fixtures, except streetlights, shall be located, aimed, or
shielded so as to minimize stray light trespassing across property boundaries.
D.   The installation, sale, offering for sale, lease, or purchase of any
mercury vapor light fixture or lamp for use as outdoor lighting is prohibited.
E.   Search lights, laser source lights, or any similar high-intensity light
shall not be permitted, except in emergencies by police and fire personnel or
at their direction or for meteorological data gathering purposes.
F.   Class I lighting may continue only until 9:00 p.m. or for as long as the
area is in active use.
G.   Illumination for outdoor recreation facilities must conform to the
shielding requirements of Table 4.24A below, except when such shielding would
interfere with the intended activity. For such facilities, partially shielded
luminaries are permitted. Examples of activities where partially shielded
luminaries are permitted include, but are not limited to, baseball, softball,
and football. Specifically, tennis, volleyball, racquetball and handball
courts, and swimming pools must utilize fully shielded luminaries. Where fully
shielded luminaries are required, the light fixtures must also conform to the
requirements of Paragraph C. above regarding light trespass.
H.   Multi-class lighting must either conform to the lamp-type and shielding
requirements of the most strict Class, as shown in Table 4.24A, or conform to
the time limitations of the least strict Class.
I.   External illumination for signs shall conform to the provisions of these
regulations.
J.   On projects where an engineer or architect is required, the developer
shall verify in writing to the Development Services Department that all outdoor
lighting was installed in accordance with the approved plans.
K.   Outdoor Light Output, Total. The maximum total amount of light, measured
in lumens, from all outdoor light fixtures. For lamp types that vary in their
output as they age (such as high pressure sodium), the initial output, as
defined by the manufacturer, is the value to be considered. For determining
compliance with this Ordinance, the light emitted from outdoor light fixtures
is to be included in the total output as follows:
1.   Outdoor light fixtures installed on poles (such as parking lot luminaries)
and light fixtures installed on the sides of the buildings or other structures,
when not shielded from above by the structure itself as defined in Paragraphs 2
and 3 below, are to be included in the total outdoor light output by simply
adding the lumen outputs of the lamps used.
2.   Outdoor light fixtures installed under canopies, building overhangs, or
roof eaves where the center of the lamp or luminaries is located at least five
(5) feet, but less than ten (10) feet from the nearest edge of the canopy or
overhang are to be included in the total outdoor light output as though they
produced only one-quarter (1/4) of the lamp’s rated lumen output.
3.   Outdoor light fixtures located under the canopy and ten (10) or more feet
from the nearest edge of a canopy, building overhang, or eave are to be
included in the total outdoor light output as though they produced only one-
tenth (1/10) of the lamp's rated lumen output.
L.   Service station Canopy Lighting. In addition to the calculations for
paragraph K.2. and K.3. above, the following requirements apply to service
station canopies:
1.   All luminaries mounted on the under surface of service station canopies
shall be fully shielded and utilize flat glass or flat plastic (acrylic or
polycarbonate) covers.
2.   The total light output used for illuminating service station canopies,
defined as the sum of all under-canopy initial bare-lamp outputs in lumens,
shall not exceed forty (40) lumens per square foot of canopy. All lighting
mounted under the canopy, including but not limited to luminaries mounted on
the lower surface of the canopy and auxiliary lighting within signage or panels
over the pumps, is to be included toward the total.
M.   Neon lighting is permitted, so long as lumen calculations from such
lighting are included in the total lumen calculations for the site, required by
this subsection. Lumens are calculated on a per foot basis, rather than per
“fixture”. Such lighting shall also be subject to the shielding requirements of
Section , unless exempted by Table 4.24A below.

P.   Outdoor internally-illuminated advertising signs shall either be
constructed with an opaque background and translucent letters and symbols or
with a colored (not white, cream, off-white, or yellow) background and lighter
letters and symbols. Lamps used for internal illumination of such signs shall
not be included in the lumens per net acre limit set in this subsection. Such
signs shall be turned off at 11:00 p.m. or when the business closes, whichever
is later.
AIRPORT LIGHTING:
Airport lighting, which is required for the safe and efficient movement of
aircraft during flight, take off, landing, and taxiing is exempt from the
provisions of this Ordinance. Lighting used for illumination of aircraft
loading, unloading, and servicing areas is exempt from the lumens per acre
limits, although it must conform to all other requirements of this Ordinance.
All other outdoor lighting at airport facilities shall comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance.

4.25 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
A.   PURPOSE. The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines
for the siting of wireless communications facilities, towers and antennas. The
goals of this section are to:
1.   Ensure access to reliable wireless communications services throughout all
areas of the Town of Chino Valley.
2.   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of
wireless facilities, towers and antennas.
3.   Encourage the location of wireless facilities, towers and antennas in non-
residential areas.
4.   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community.
5.   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing wireless facility and
tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-
use towers.
6.   Encourage users of wireless facilities, towers and antennas to locate
them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal.
7.   Encourage users of wireless facilities, towers and antennas to configure
them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the wireless
facilities, towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape
screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques.
8.   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
9.   Ensure public health, safety, welfare and convenience as enumerated in
Section
1.9.2(A) of this code.
10.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through
engineering and careful sitting of tower structures. In furtherance of these
goals, the Town shall give due consideration to the General Plan, other
provisions of this Ordinance, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive
areas in approving sites for the location of wireless facilities, towers and
antennas.
B.   DEFINITIONS. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings set forth below:
ALTERNATIVE TOWER STRUCTURE means man-made trees, clock towers, bell steeples,
light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage
or conceal the presence of antennas, towers or wireless facilities.
ANTENNA means any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on a tower,
building or structure and used in communications that radiates or captures
electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies
(excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications signals or other
communication signals.
CO-LOCATION means the use by two or more wireless communications providers of
the same support structure or the same site, as defined in subsection “I”
below.
CONCEALED WIRELESS FACILITY means a wireless facility that cannot be directly
seen because it is enclosed within a structure or screen that completely

4.29 DESIGN CONCEPTS
A.   Development goals: protect investment in the community by encouraging
consistently high quality development and promote projects that are suitable in
the context of a southwest environment.
B.   Applicability: to achieve these goals, the design concepts apply to all
new commercial developments and redevelopment or remodeling of existing
commercial developments where more than 50% of the exterior of the structure
will be substantially modified.
1.   Site planning. The relationship to existing residential development:
a.   Position trash enclosures, compactors, truck loading areas and outdoor
storage away from residential uses to the extent practical.
b.   Locate drive-through lanes away from adjoining single-family and multi-
family developments. Locate speakers and menu boards so that noise is not
directed toward residential uses and incorporate a screen wall and landscaping
to lessen noise.
c.   Construct a masonry wall to separate a residential development from a
proposed commercial development and plant large evergreen trees in the required
landscape area to buffer the residential use.
d.   Strive to minimize driveway cuts on State Route 89 and arterial streets by
providing vehicular cross-access easement s and shared access driveways between
adjacent commercial projects.
2.   Signage:
a.   Screen restaurant menu boards from adjacent public rights-of-way and
adjacent properties.
3.   Landscaping: provide landscaping that is ten (10) percent above the
requirements of the minimum landscaping pattern requirements.
4.   Lighting:
a.   Locate light poles in landscaped areas. Paint concrete light pole bases to
match the primary color of the building or finish the bases to match parking
screen walls.
b.   Highlighting of unique or special features of the site. Such as
architectural features. Specimen trees and artwork with accent lighting should
be considered.
c.   Use decorative wall-mounted sconces or light fixtures when building
lighting is proposed on elevations away from residential uses.
C.   Building design:
1.   Massing: the visual impact of a building depends not only on its size, but
also on the relationship between its length, width and height.
a.   Building mass should be broken into smaller elements, consistent with the
proportions of the architectural style selected and surrounding uses.
b.   In large multi-building projects, vary the size, massing and height of the
buildings in relation to each other.
c.   Reduction of building mass may be achieved by using a combination of the
following techniques:
i.   Variation in the rooflines and form.
ii.   Use of ground level arcades and covered areas.
iii.   Use of protected and recessed entries.
iv.   Use of vertical elements on or in front of expansive blank walls.
v.   Addition of windows on elevations facing streets.
2.   Design:
a.   Provide weather and sun protection, such as overhangs, awnings and
canopies.
b.   Predominant exterior building materials should be of high quality and
durable. These include, but are not limited to:
i.   Brick, adobe, mortar washed slump block.
ii.   Stone, natural or faux.
iii.   Integral color, sand blasted or stained textured masonry.
iv.   Split-face or scored concrete masonry units.
v.   Textured tilt-up concrete panels.
vi.   Stucco.
vii.   Metal roofs.
viii.   Concrete and clay tile roofs.
ix.   Clear and tinted glass.
x.   Architectural metal.
c.   Predominant exterior building materials should not include the following:
i.   Un-textured tilt-up concrete panels.
ii.   Pre-fabricated steel panels.
iii.   Corrugated metal.
iv.   Highly reflective glass.
v.   Grooved plywood.
d.   The front elevation colors should possess low reflectivity
characteristics, and respect the diversity of color in the southwest.

4.30  COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSE STANDARDS
A.   In commercial or industrial zoning districts:
1.   No greater than ten (10) percent of the floor area shall be used for
retail sales or restaurants which shall be an accessory use to the greenhouse
use.
2.   No greater than twenty (20) percent of the floor area shall be used for
entertainment purposes, which shall be an accessory use to the greenhouse use.
B.   In agricultural/residential zoning districts, no greater than ten (10)
percent of the floor area shall be used for the sale of farm produce that is

5.2 SUBDIVISION APPLICATION PROCEDURES
5.2.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
(Ord. 06-678, passed 11-9-2006)
A.   In General: Every land division shall conform to the goals and objectives
of the General Plan, Unified Development Ordinance, and other ordinances
adopted by Council and laws of the State of Arizona that specifically relate to

property owners or their authorized representatives. The Zoning Administrator
may require proof of ownership/agency prior to accepting an application.
C.   Zoning Standards: Proposed subdivisions must be designed to meet the
specific requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. In the
event that a change in zoning is required to enable the development to be built
as proposed, any necessary zoning amendment must be initiated by the property
owner (or authorized agent) in accordance with the procedures for processing
applications for changes in zoning set forth in the Town’s Unified Development
Ordinance. No subdivision plat for which a zone change is required may be
considered by the Council until the required zone change has been adopted by
the Council. The applications for both the requested zoning amendment and the
preliminary plat may be filed concurrently.
D.   Dedication or Reservation of Public Land: Where a tract to be subdivided
contains all or any part of a planned park, recreation facility, school, open
space, water facility, wastewater facility, public safety facility, flood
control facility or other area shown on the General Plan as a public area, or

of appropriate public entity or reserved for acquisition by the Town or
appropriate public entity within a specified time period. The applicant and the
Town or appropriate public agency shall reach an agreement regarding dedication
or acquisition of the property for such purpose prior to consideration of final
plat by the Council. If a parcel of property is to be reserved rather than
dedicated, the Town may require the Subdivider to designate the reserved area
on the final plat subject to the following conditions:
1.   The land reserved shall be in the size and shape as to permit the
remainder of the land area in which the reservation is located to develop in an
orderly and efficient manner.
2.   The public entity for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall have a
period of one year after the recording of the final subdivision plat to enter
into an agreement to acquire such reserved land area. The purchase price shall
be the fair market value thereof at the time of the filing of the preliminary
plat plus the taxes against such reserved area from the date of the
reservation, and any other costs incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance
of such reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering
such reserved area.

exercise the reservation agreement set forth in paragraph 5.2.1(D)(3) above,
within the agreed upon period of time, the reservation of such area shall
terminate unless a mutually agreeable time extension is executed between the
entity and the subdivider.
E.   Outline of the Review Process: The preparation, review and approval of
subdivisions within the Town Limits shall proceed through the following
progressive stages:
1.   Pre-Application Conference with Town staff;
2.   Preliminary plat submittal: The preliminary plat will be reviewed by Town
staff to ensure it is complete and consistent with these Subdivision
Regulations; the complete preliminary plat submittal is then considered by
Planning and Zoning Commission and Council;
3.   Subdivision Technical Review - considered and reviewed by Town Staff and
pertinent outside public service and utility agencies;
3.   Final plat submittal - Includes review by the Town staff to ensure the
Final Plat meets the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations and
Subdivision Technical Review by Town staff and pertinent outside public service
and utility agencies, all prior to consideration of the Final Plat by the
Council.
5.2.2 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE
Pre-application Conference: The pre-application conference precedes preparation
of platting and improvement plans by the applicant. During this conference,
applicants informally provide Town staff with an overview of the proposed land
division, after which the Town staff advises the applicants of specific public
objectives related to the subject tract, and provides the applicant with
detailed information regarding platting procedures and requirements.
A.   At the pre-application meeting, the applicant must provide a general
outline of the proposed development including:
1.   Sketch plan(s) and ideas regarding land use, street and lot arrangement,
and tentative lot sizes.
2.   Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal, surface
drainage and street improvements.
B.   Town staff will discuss the proposal with the applicant and provide input
and suggestions regarding procedural steps, including the public hearing
timeline, public policy objectives, design and improvement standards, and
general platting requirements. Then, depending upon the scope of the proposed
development, the Town staff will:
1.   Check the existing General Plan land use designation for the proposed
subdivision and determine if a General Plan amendment will be required and if
such amendment will be obtained prior to additional processing of the
application.
2.   Check the existing zoning of the proposed subdivision and recommend
changes in zoning if necessary or desirable.
3.   Provide the applicant with information regarding existing and proposed
schools, parks, and other public places, and inform the applicant of the Town’s
requirements for infrastructure improvements required for the proposed
subdivision.
4.   Inspect the site or otherwise determine its relationship to major streets,
utility systems, and adjacent land uses, and identify any unusual problems,
including but not limited to those related to topography, utilities, and
drainage.
5.   Determine whether a Development Master Plan (DMP) will be required prior
to the preparation of a preliminary plat, and the extent to which the property
owner will be required to prepare it.
C.   Subdivision Referral and Approval Process: Within fifteen (15) calendar
days after the pre- application conference, the Zoning Administrator or his/her
designee will send a written notice to the subdivider with staff’s
recommendations related to preparation and submittal of a preliminary plat by
developer to be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Council, and with a determination as to whether a Development Master Plan will
be required pursuant to 5.2.2(D) of these Subdivision Regulations. If the
proposed subdivision does not require a Development Master Plan, the subdivider
may proceed with the preparation of a preliminary plat to be considered by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council. As a prerequisite of
preliminary plat review by the Development Services Director and the Public
Works Director, the subdivider shall submit copies of letters written to the
following agencies informing them of the intent to subdivide and to learn the
general requirement for public utilities and public dedications applicable to
the subdivision needs:
1.   Appropriate public utilities
2.   Cable television and communication companies
3.   Chino Valley Unified School District
4.   Yavapai County Health Department
5.   ADOT
6.   U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service
7.   Yavapai Flood Control District
D.   Development Master Plan: A DMP shall be required prior to the preparation
of a preliminary plat if any of the following apply: (i) the tract is larger
than 100 acres; (ii) the tract is to be developed in multiple phases or if the
tract is only a portion of a larger landholding of the subdivider; or (iii) the
tract is part of a larger land area the development of which is complicated by
unusual topographic, utility, land use, land ownership, or other conditions. As
part of the notification described in 5.2.2(C) above, the Zoning Administrator
or his/her designee shall notify the subdivider of the requirement to prepare a
DMP. To ensure cohesive development, the subdivider may include areas within
its DMP that are anticipated for future acquisition. If subdivider is
requesting a zone change as part of the development, the conceptual land use
plan required for such zone change application may, at the reasonable
discretion of the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee, serve as the DMP
for the subdivision.
1.   Preparation: Development Master Plans must be prepared to a scale and
accuracy commensurate with their purposes, and must include:
a.   General street pattern with particular attention to collector streets and
future circulation throughout the development;
b.   General location and size of existing and proposed school sites, parks,
and other public areas;
c.   Location of shopping centers, multiple-family residential or other non-
residential land uses;
d.   Methods proposed for sewage disposal, water supply and storm drainage;
e.   Approximate densities and intensities of various land uses.
2.   Phasing Plan: If development is to take place in several stages, the DMP
must be submitted as a supporting document for each stage. The DMP must be kept
up to date by the subdivider as modifications take place.
3.   Approval: After Town staff has determined the required elements in 5.2.2
(D)(1) are included in the proposed DMP, the DMP shall be forwarded to the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council for review and approval. Upon
acceptance of the general design approach by the Commission and the Council,
the subdivider may submit a preliminary plat for review.

(110%) of the complete installation of the improvements. This assurance shall
provide for its forfeiture to the Town in the event the Town does not accept
the improvements by the declared completion date due to the default of the
subdivider. Any portion of the forfeiture in excess of the expenses incurred by
the Town in connection with the installation of the improvements shall be
returned to the subdivider. The owner must provide the Town with one of the
following types of financial assurances for the completion of the construction
of the improvements required for the development of the subdivision:
(1)   Surety Bond
i.   A surety bond shall be executed by the subdivider with a corporation duly
licensed and authorized to transact surety business in the State of Arizona, as
surety. The bond shall be in favor of the Town, shall be continuous in form,
and shall require that the total aggregate liability of the surety for all

the Town, which shall recover the construction costs first from cash deposit or
the bond, and second from the subdivider as to any amounts not covered by the
cash deposit or the bond.
(2)   Irrevocable Letter of Credit
i.   A letter of credit shall be provided by a banking institution authorized
to transact business in the State of Arizona. The letter of credit shall be in
favor of the Town for the full amount of the required assurance.
ii.   The letter of credit shall be released upon satisfactory performance of
the work and its acceptance by the Town according to its customary
requirements. In the Town's sole discretion as infrastructure is completed, the
subdivider may subsequently replace the original letter of credit with
substitute letters of credit as the required infrastructure is completed and
accepted, so long as the total amount available to the Town is at all times
sufficient to cover the cost of the remaining infrastructure to be built.
iii.   The letter of credit will only be surrendered by the Town if the
subdivider provides other security to the Town, in a form satisfactory to the
Town Attorney, and in an amount that will ensure completion of the subdivider's
obligations that remain to be performed.
iv.   Any work abandoned or not completed by the subdivider may be completed by
the Town, which shall recover the construction costs first from the letter of
credit, and second from the subdivider as to any amounts not covered by the
letter of credit.
(3)   Cash or Certified Check
i.   A cash deposit for the full amount of the required assurance in an account
held by subdivider separate from other subdivider accounts, at a banking
institution authorized to transact business in the State of Arizona. The
subdivider shall execute a deposit account control agreement in the Town's
favor, authorizing the Town to have exclusive control over the account until
all of subdivider's obligations have been met.
ii.   The cash deposit shall be released upon satisfactory performance of the
work and its acceptance by the Town according to its customary requirements. In
the Town's sole discretion as infrastructure is completed, the Town may release
amounts from the account as the required infrastructure is completed and
accepted, so long as the total amount available to the Town is at all times
sufficient to cover the cost of the remaining infrastructure to be built.
iii.   The cash deposit will only be surrendered by the Town if the subdivider
provides other security to the Town, in a form satisfactory to the Town
Attorney, and in an amount that will ensure completion of the subdivider's
obligations that remain to be performed.
iv.   Any work abandoned or not completed by the subdivider may be completed by
the Town, which shall recover the construction costs first from the cash on
deposit, and second from the subdivider as to any amounts not covered by the
cash on deposit.
(4)   Alternative Assurances. In lieu of providing cash, a letter of credit, or
a surety bond, the Town Attorney may approve and recommend to Council such
alternative assurances that it deems sufficient to guarantee and assure
construction of the required improvements.
c.   When no adjacent arterial or collector (as identified on the Chino Valley
Streets Master Plan) is being constructed and the improvement of an arterial or
collector street by a governmental agency is anticipated in the short-term
future, the subdivider shall deposit the current estimated cost of improving
the abutting half street with the Town in full satisfaction of its
responsibility to the Town for such half-street improvements.
13.   Dedication and acknowledgment - A statement dedicating all streets and
easements for public use by the person holding legal title of record to the
property. If the property contains any liens, all lien holders shall execute an

it must include the appropriate easements to allow for use by, and access to,
public utility providers, refuse collectors, and other public services. All
signatures for dedication and acknowledgment shall be notarized.
14.   Final plat Review and Approval
a.   Complete Application: Upon acceptance of an application for approval of a
final plat, the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee will have five (5)
working days to advise the applicant if the submittal is complete. Copies of
complete applications will be sent to the Town departments and utility and
public safety agencies that serve the area. No application shall be deemed
complete unless it includes all of the required items set forth above.
b.   The Commission shall consider the final plat at a properly posted and
advertised public meeting. The Commission shall provide a recommendation to the
Council to approve the final plat, as submitted, to approve final plat with
conditions, or to deny the final plat.
c.   After the Planning and Zoning Commission has forwarded its recommendation
to the Council, the Council shall consider the proposed final plat at a
properly posted and advertised public meeting. The Council may approve the
final plat as submitted, approve the final plat with conditions as recommended
by the Commission, approve the final plat with additional or modified
conditions, or deny the final plat.
d.   Recordation: Upon receipt of the required assurances, and proof of
adequate water supply, the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee will have
the final plat recorded and provide a recorded copy of the plat to the
applicant.
e.   Each approved final plat shall expire if not recorded within one (1) year
of receiving approval from the Town Council.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020; Ord. 2022-923, passed 10-11-2022)
5.2.5 SUBDIVISION PLAT AMENDMENTS
There are three (3) types of plat amendments that apply to any recorded
subdivision:
A.   Replat: The following activities shall be considered a replat and require
an application and processing with the Final Plat procedures and subsequent
approval by the Council:
1.   Any division of a lot or lots in a recorded subdivision resulting in an
increase in the total number of lots in that subdivision.
2.   Any revision to a final plat involving dedication or abandonment of land
for a public street, public easement, or other public rights-of-way.
3.   Any change in lot lines in a recorded subdivision affecting 5% or more of
the total lot area within the subdivision; provided that no such adjustments
shall be permitted to reduce lot sizes below the minimum for the applicable
zoning category.
4.   Any changes in the location of streets, easements or and other rights-of-
way that are adjacent to 10% or more of the lots in a subdivision.
5.   Any changes in the exterior boundary of a recorded subdivision.
B.   Lot Line Adjustment: The following activities shall be considered a lot
line adjustment and shall require an application in accordance and processing
with the Final Plat procedures, but may be administratively approved by the
Development Services Director. Notwithstanding the above, the Development
Services Director may request and the Council may direct that any re-plat
request be acted on by the Council.
1.   Any joining or merger of lots in a recorded subdivision.
2.   Any joining of lots and subsequent division of those same lots in a
recorded subdivision, so long as such division results in no increase in the
total number of lots in that subdivision.
3.   Any changes in lot lines that result in only nominal increases or
decreases of lot sizes (less than 5% of total lot area).
4.   Any nominal changes (adjacent to 10% or fewer of the lots in a
subdivision) in the location of streets, easements, and other rights-of-way.
C.   Plat Correction: An amendment to a plat for the sole purpose of correcting
a scrivener's error, such as for a distance or course, may be administratively
approved by the Development Services Director with the correction noted and the
plat labeled as "Amended Map of ______."
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020)
5.2.6 LAND SPLITS AND OTHER DIVISIONS OF LAND NOT REQUIRING A SUBDIVISION
Land splits or divisions of land not meeting the definition of land split or
subdivision do not require the submission and approval of preliminary and/or
final plats. Such divisions do not include or allow for a land split or further
division of previously-subdivided land. Land splits with a resulting lot size
of less than one (1) acre in size do not qualify for land splits and are
required to go through the subdivision process.
A.   All parcels or lots created by any division of land must meet the minimum
parcel size applicable under the current zoning of the lots or parcels created
by the division of land.
B.   All parcels or lots created in a division of land shall have the required
frontage on a dedicated and improved street. If a parcel or lot does not have
the required frontage (determined by the zoning) on a dedicated and improved
street (public or private), then the applicant shall be required to go through
the subdivision process.
C.   The proposed division of land may not modify lot lines in a manner that
would cause building setbacks to be less than required by the underlying zoning
or increase the non-conformance of an already non-conforming structure relating
to building setbacks.
D.   The parcels or lots created by the division of land shall have permanent
legal access by connecting to a street that is part of the public access
system, or to a private street created by a properly recorded plat.
E.   A person proposing a land split shall submit a Record of Survey prepared
by a civil engineer or registered land surveyor licensed in Arizona that
reflects the lots or parcels created by the land split and the required legal
access for the lots or parcels created, as set forth in Subsection
5.2.6(D). The access required to be depicted on the Record of Survey shall be
only that portion leading to a public street or a street that is part of the
public access system. No building permit shall be issued for a lot or parcel
created by a land split until the party seeking the building permit has
provided the requisite Record of Survey reflecting compliance with this Section
5.2.6 and has paid the required fees for review and approval of land splits as
those fees may be established by the Council. No building permit shall be
issued for a lot or parcel created by a division of land other than a land
split or a subdivision until the party seeking the building permit has provided
the requisite Record of Survey reflecting compliance with this Section
5.2.6.
F.   All land splits or divisions of land not meeting the definition of land
split or subdivision shall be required to provide street improvements along the
lot frontage proportional to the impact of the parcel on the existing or
planned street and consistent with the improvements constructed by adjoining
parcels, but in no event less than the required street improvements for private
streets in subdivisions of fewer than three lots, as shown in Table 5.2 below.
If the parcel is adjacent to a public arterial or collector street, in lieu of
making the street improvements described in this paragraph, the owner of the
new parcel may contribute an amount to the Town equal to the parcel's
proportionate share of the improvements already made, or to be made, to the
public street. After the owner makes such contribution, the Town shall be
responsible for the costs related to any such improvements.
G.   Extension of utilities shall be measured from the closest property line of
the Parent Parcel.
H.   When a parcel is divided via land split pursuant to this Section
5.2.6, the Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to include on the
Record of Survey the following statement:
   "The parcels depicted on this Record of Survey were created on the date of
this survey, and any further division of the land shown on this Record of
Survey shall be treated as a subdivision."
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020; Ord. 2022-923, passed 10-11-2022)
5.2.7 MINOR SUBDIVISION
The minor subdivision process provides relief from certain administrative
requirements related to subdivisions of ten (10) or fewer lots with a resulting
lot size of greater than or equal to one (1) acre in size. In order to utilize
the minor subdivision process, the subdivider shall provide, as part of its
application, certification that the land sought to be subdivided consists of
ten (10) or fewer lots and that such subdivision is situated such that future
extensions of streets therein cannot facilitate a subdivision of more than ten
(10) lots. The minor subdivision process cannot be used for lots with a zoning
classification of less than one (1) acre in size. Subdivisions meeting the
requirements of a minor subdivision shall meet all of the requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations except as follows:
A.   Preliminary Plats. Subdividers of minor subdivisions shall be permitted to
seek final plat approval in a single stage, without the need for a preliminary
plat approval by the Commission.
B.   Drainage Design. A minor subdivision subdivider shall not be required to
submit an engineered drainage study as required by Section
5.3.5(H) of these Subdivision Regulations; provided, however that the
subdivider shall be required to provide documentation containing sufficient
detail, as determined by the Public Works Director, to show the drainage for
the subdivision will meet the requirements of Sections
5.3.5(A)–(G) of these Subdivision Regulations.
C.   Traffic Study. A minor subdivision subdivider shall not be required to
submit an engineered traffic study as required by Section
5.3.1(C)(2) of these Subdivision Regulations; provided, however that the
subdivider shall be required to provide documentation containing sufficient
detail, as determined by the Public Works Director, to show how traffic from
the subdivision will safely join the existing street system.
D.   Geotechnical Report. A minor subdivision subdivider shall not be required
to submit a geotechnical report as required by Section
5.4(E) of these Subdivision Regulations; provided, however that the subdivider
shall be required to provide documentation containing sufficient detail, as
determined by the Public Works Director, to show that safe, durable streets
will be constructed.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020; Ord. 2022-923, passed 10-11-2022)
5.2.8 RURAL SUBDIVISION
Property with an underlying residential zoning designation of one acre or
larger may be developed as a rural subdivision. Unless also permitted to
utilize the reduced procedural requirements of a minor subdivision, all rural
subdivisions shall follow the submittal and review requirements for
subdivisions under these Subdivision Regulations. Rural subdivisions shall be
required to meet the subdivision improvement standards set forth in these
Subdivision Regulations, except for the following:
A.   Private Streets. Rural subdivisions may utilize private streets meeting
the requirements set forth in Table 5.2.
B.   Sidewalks, vertical curb and gutter, as described in Table 5.1.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020)
5.3 DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
5.3.1 STREET LOCATION AND ARRANGEMENT
A.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all
streets should conform to the Town's General Plan Circulation/Transportation
Element and Transportation Plan and should ensure public safety and
convenience, and respond to existing natural features of terrain, vegetation,
and drainage.
B.   Street layout shall provide for the continuation of existing principal
streets through new subdivisions. Principal streets shall typically follow
section or mid-section lines, however, if the alignment is impractical then
principal street right-of-way should be provided at least every three thousand
(3,000) feet.
C.   Proposed streets shall be arranged to provide future connection with
adjoining unplatted lands.
1.   Street connections to an adjoining platted tract shall be made only to
those extended streets of the platted tract.
2.   Street connections shall be designed to accommodate the amount of
increased traffic flow generated by the proposed subdivision, as determined by
an engineered traffic study or as approved by the Public Works Department.
D.   Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by through
traffic. If topography allows and suitable alternate locations are available,
the subdivider shall provide at least two (2) points of access for ingress/
egress into the subdivision.
E.   The maximum length of cul-de-sac streets shall be one thousand, five
hundred (1,500) feet measured from the intersection of the right-of-way lines
to the extreme depth of the turning circle along the street centerline.
Regardless of length, no cul-de-sac shall provide access to more than twenty-
five (25) single family residences.
F.   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial and collector routes, sufficient right-of-way may be required for
access, frontage streets, and/or turning movements or for reverse frontage
combined with a one (1) foot non-vehicular access easement abutting the major
route; or for such other treatment as may be justified for protection of
residential properties from traffic hazards occurring on the major route.
G.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains the right-of-way of a limited access
highway or an irrigation canal or abuts a commercial or industrial land use,
the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee may recommend location of a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distance shall be
determined with due regard for approach grades, drainage, bridges or future
grade separations.
H.   Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography as to
produce desirable lots of maximum utility and streets of reasonable gradient
and to facilitate adequate drainage.
I.   No alleys may be constructed in residential, commercial, and
industrial subdivisions, except that the Zoning Administrator or his/her
designee may waive the requirements in certain areas because of topography,
open space provided or service access.
J.   Half streets shall be discouraged, but may be permissible where necessary
to provide right-of-way required by the Town's General Plan and Transportation
Plan, to complete a street pattern already begun or to assure reasonable
development of a number of adjoining parcels. The minimum paved street width of
a half street is twenty (20) feet. Where there exists a platted half
street abutting the tract to be subdivided, the remaining half shall be platted
within the tract. In lieu of the actual construction of a half street, the
subdivider may provide the Town a cash payment for the probable cost of the
half street. The amount of the cash payment shall be determined by a registered
civil engineer and must be approved by the Public Works Director. Such funds
will be held on deposit by the Town until such time as the Town proceeds to
improve the full width of the street.
K.   A minimum of two (2) permanent reference survey monuments shall be
required for a street as a recoverable point for future surveys.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020)
5.3.2 STREET DESIGN
All streets in the Town, unless otherwise specified in these Subdivision
Regulations, shall be designed to the standards in this subsection and as
follows:
A.   Minimum required Right-of-Way widths shall be provided as set forth in
Table 5-1 below. Additionally, the following standards shall apply:
1.   Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular right-of-way sixty (60)
feet in radius with a minimum improved traffic turning circle forty-eight (48)
feet in radius.
2.   Dead end streets will not be approved except in locations designated by
the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee as necessary for future extension
to facilitate development of adjacent lands. A dead end street serving more
than four (4) lots shall provide a temporary turning circle with a forty-eight
(48) foot radius or other acceptable design to accomplish adequate access.
3.   Local roads for commercial or industrial subdivisions are highly
recommended at sixty (60) feet. However, when the size of subdivisions or other
factors limit the inclusion of the sixty (60)-foot rights-of-way, the Zoning
Administrator or his/her designee may approve the use of fifty (50)-foot
rights-of-way with all intersection chamfers at forty-five (45) feet.
4.   Access or frontage streets shall be provided as required by a traffic
impact study.

Street Design Notes
(1)   Currently, all principal arterial routes are state highways, owned and
maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation.
(2)   Sidewalk may be required on only one (1) side of the road with an
increased width if approved by the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee and
the Public Works Director. (Also, see note #3.)
(3)   A minimum of two (2) foot wide shoulders is required if no sidewalk is
installed. These shoulders shall maintain the same slope as the pavement and
shall be constructed of ABC or an approved equal. However, construction of
sidewalks on collector roads shall be determined through a Development
Agreement.
Note: These standards are primarily for new roadway construction. These
standards may be adjusted on projects involving rehabilitation or
reconstruction of existing improvements as approved by the Public Works
Director.
(4)   62' versus 50-feet right-of-way options for urban level local street to
accommodate subdivision that have on-street parking versus no on-street
parking.

(1)   Rural subdivision private streets shall meet the roadway geometric
criteria and pavement structural section requirements set forth in Sections
5.3.2(A) - (D) of these Subdivision Regulations.
(2)   Subdividers utilizing rural subdivision private streets shall be
required to meet the homeowners’ association requirements set forth in
Section
5.3.2(E) of these Subdivision Regulations.
(3)   If the proposed subdivision serves as an access point to other lots or
parcels, and the total number of potential remaining lots that could be
developed, together with the proposed subdivision, is more than 10, the
proposed subdivision shall make the “Improvement Width” the same as a
development with 10 or more lots. As an example, if the proposed subdivision
is three lots, but the private street could continue beyond the proposed
subdivision to include more than 10 lots, the “Improvement Width” must be 24
feet. Surface Depth and Edge Improvements shall remain as listed for the
proposed number of lots in the proposed subdivision.
 
B.   Grades
1.   Maximum:
a.   Arterial routes: as determined by the Public Works Director.
b.   Collector streets eight (8) percent.
c.   Local residential streets twelve (12) percent.
(Maximum longitudinal slopes of up to eighteen (18) percent may be used for a
distance not to exceed three hundred (300) feet if existing terrain dictates,
and if approved by the Public Works Director).
d.   Cul-de-sacs eight (8) percent.
e.   Intersections five (5) percent for a minimum of fifty (50) feet from
points of intersection.
2.   Minimum: all streets shall have a minimum longitudinal slope of four-
tenths (0.4) percent.
3.   Desirable: all streets six (6) percent.
4.   Exceptions may be made upon showing of extraordinary circumstances by the
subdivider and review and approval by the Public Works Director.
C.   Vertical Curves
1.   Arterial routes: Minimum length, one hundred (100) feet, or as determined
by using the AASHTO Standards.
2.   Collector and minor streets: Minimum length, one hundred (100) feet, or as
determined by using the AASHTO Standards for residential streets, the length of
the vertical curve may be reduced to fifty (50) feet if existing terrain
dictates and if approved by the Public Works Director.
3.   When the longitudinal grade for all streets changes with an algebraic
difference of one (1) percent as measured between the tangent grades in
percent, a vertical curve shall be provided.
D.   Horizontal Alignment
1.   Arterial routes: As determined by the Public Works Director.
2.   When tangent center lines deflect from each other more than ten (10)
degrees and less than ninety (90) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve
with a minimum centerline radius of five hundred (500) feet for collector
streets and one hundred fifty (150) feet for local streets.
3.   Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent section of centerline not
less than one hundred (100) feet long, unless the radius exceeds seven hundred
fifty (750) feet on arterial and collector streets or two hundred fifty (250)
feet on local streets, in which cases fifty (50) feet of tangent shall be
required if approved by the Public Works Director.
4.   Intersecting arterial and collector streets shall do so at an angle that
shall not vary from ninety (90) degrees by more than ten (10) degrees;
intersections of local streets shall not vary from ninety (90) degrees by more
than fifteen (15) degrees.
5.   Street jogs shall be avoided. Street intersections shall be a minimum of
one hundred-fifty (150) feet apart unless otherwise approved by the Public
Works Director.
6.   Minor streets intersecting a collector street or arterial route shall have
a tangent section of centerline at least one hundred fifty (150) feet in length
measured from the right-of-way line of the major street; except that, no such
tangent is required when the minor street curve has a centerline radius greater
than four hundred (400) feet with the center located on the major street right-
of-way line.
Where topographic conditions make necessary other treatment to secure the best
overall design, these standards may be modified by the Public Works Director.
7.   Street intersections with more than four (4) legs, and Y-type
intersections where legs meet at acute angles shall be avoided.
8.   At street intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by
circular arc having a minimum chamfer length of thirty-five (35) feet for
collector and arterial streets and twenty-five (25) feet for local streets.
E.   Private Streets
1.   Private streets in zoning districts that do not permit rural subdivisions
shall be constructed to conform to current Town street standards, including but
not limited to right-of-way widths, roadway geometric criteria, and pavement
structural section. Private streets in zoning districts that allow rural
subdivisions shall be constructed to conform to current Town street standards,
including but not limited to right-of-way widths, roadway geometric criteria,
and pavement structural section, except as specifically modified by Table 5-
1 above.
2.   If private streets are proposed for a subdivision, whether urban or rural,
maintenance of such streets shall be solely the responsibility of the
homeowners. A homeowners’ association shall be established at the time the
final plat is approved with a mechanism for collecting funds to be placed in an
escrow account for future maintenance of the private streets. A note shall be
placed on the final plat that states, “All private streets shown on this plat
shall be maintained by the homeowners association. The Town will not maintain
these streets and will not take the streets into the public street system
unless they are improved, at the sole expense of the property owners, to the
Town public street standards that are in effect at the time of the request.”
3.   An emergency rapid entry system for unrestricted entry of police and fire
emergency vehicle at all gated locations shall be provided. For uniformity, the
only allowable system shall be the “Knox Rapid Entry System.”
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020)
5.3.3 WATER FACILITIES DESIGN
Until September 1, 2025, any lot that is created in conformance with the
requirements for (1) land splits not requiring a subdivision in Section
5.2.6, or (2) a combination of the minor subdivision and rural subdivision
provisions in Sections
5.2.7 and
5.2.8 of these Subdivision Regulations, may be developed without connecting to
the Town’s water system, even if the lot is served at the time of building
permit application.
See Town Code Title V for all other regulations.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020; Ord. 2022-923, passed 10-11-2022)
5.3.4 SEWER FACILITIES DESIGN
Until September 1, 2025, any lot that is created in conformance with the
requirements for (1) land splits not requiring a subdivision in Section
5.2.6, or (2) a combination of the minor subdivision and rural subdivision
provisions in Sections
5.2.7 and
5.2.8 of these Subdivision Regulations, and which otherwise meets the
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations and any applicable law,
regulation or ordinance, may be developed without connecting to the Town’s
sewer system, even if the lot is served at the time of building permit
application.
See Town Code Title V for all other regulations.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020; Ord. 2022-923, passed 10-11-2022)
5.3.5 DRAINAGE DESIGN
A.   Drainage and topography shall be a primary consideration of any
subdivision.
B.   The preservation of natural flood areas, streams, washes, arroyos, rivers
or ephemeral drainage courses should be maintained, if possible, in their
natural state. The limits of the ten (10) year flood event shall define the
extent of the area of concern. The only exceptions are for roadway crossings
and utility lines, if no other alternative exists. Subdividers are encouraged
to preserve natural flood areas to the maximum extent possible.
C.   Drainage layout and development shall meet all State and Federal
requirements to allow residents of Chino Valley to purchase flood insurance, to
receive disaster relief, to obtain real estate loans and to minimize flood
damage.
D.   Subdivision improvements that propose grading and/or grade changes shall
not have an adverse impact on surrounding property. At the boundaries of the
subdivision, all drainage and floodwaters shall be accepted and released so
that the flow characteristics are minimally disturbed by providing appropriate
entrance and exit transitions.
E.   All weather access to all lots shall be provided during the regulatory
flood, which means depths of flows over streets will not exceed one (1) foot to
allow passage of emergency vehicles. The standard applies to both public and
private streets.
F.   All drainage ways that convey fifty (50) cubic feet per second or more
during a one-hundred (100)-year flood event, shall be considered regulatory
flood ways. Regulatory flood ways shall be maintained by the adjacent property
owner within the subdivision, unless the Town has agreed to allow such flood
ways to be dedicated to the Town with provisions for maintenance access ramps.
Flows less than fifty (50) cubic feet per second shall be regulated for impacts
to buildings and structures, particularly, the placement of the finished first
floor or basement, and areas designated for containing such flows shall be
identified as a common area or noted on the final plat as impacting a lot and
the lot owner's responsibility for maintenance.
G.   Drainage basins or watersheds with known flood hazards shall be designated
as critical basins. Within designated critical basins, all proposed
subdivisions shall address on-site detention for the two (2)-, ten (10)- and
one hundred (100)-year flood events to mitigate the post-development drainage
to the pre-development levels. If the subdivider can demonstrate that on-site
detention will exacerbate the downstream condition then the Public Works
Director may allow for modifications to the requirement.
H.   A drainage study that addresses the hydrologic and hydraulic components
relating to onsite and off-site drainage shall be developed for each
subdivision. The study shall be prepared by a registered Arizona Professional
Engineer. The drainage study shall be approved before the street improvement
plans and final plat are approved. If the subdivision will be developed in
phases, a master drainage plan will be required.
5.3.6 BLOCK DESIGN
A.   Blocks should not exceed one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet in length
between street centerlines. Variation from this requirement may be justified
where topography or optimal lot configurations are achieved or when lot sizes
average one-half acre or greater.
B.   Blocks should have sufficient width for an optimal layout of two (2) tiers
of lots of the size required by these Subdivision Regulations.
C.   Where practical, pedestrian ways with a minimum width of ten (10) feet may
be required at mid-block and/or internal connection locations where essential
for access to schools, playgrounds, common open space or other community
facilities. Pedestrian ways may be used for utility purposes.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020)
5.3.7 LOT PLANNING
A.   Lot width, depth, and area shall comply with the minimum development
standards of the applicable zoning district.
B.   Lots having double frontage should be avoided except where necessary to
provide separation of the residential development from traffic collectors and
arterials.
C.   Corner lots should be a minimum of ten (10) feet wider than the interior
lots within the same block.
D.   The depth to width ratio of useable area shall be no greater than three
(3) to one (1).
E.   Grouping of wider side yards of no less than thirty (30) feet in combined
width shall be encouraged to convey openness and privacy as well as create
useable storage area.
F.   Where gross densities of four (4) units to the acre or greater are
provided, front yard setback lines should be staggered within a ten (10)-foot
range to create a diversified streetscape. No front yard should be less than
twenty (20) feet in depth, measured from the property line to the closest point
of the structure.
G.   Where a two (2)-story single-family dwelling is provided, the rear yard
setback should be a minimum of thirty (30) feet.
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020)
5.3.8 EASEMENT PLANNING
A.   Generally, a Public Utility Easement (PUE) shall be twenty (20) feet in
width. The location of the PUE of shall be approved by the Public Works
Director.
B.   The subdivider must provide a one (1)-foot easement prohibiting vehicular
access to and from arterials and collectors from rear yards of double frontage
lots.
C.   No wall structures are allowed or permitted within any Public Utility
Easement (PUE).
(Ord. 2020-885, passed 9-8-2020)

DXF, DWG or other similar industry standards digital file developed in a recent
version of AutoCAD according to the Town’s technological capabilities.
Additionally, a certified letter from a professional land surveyor shall be
required, stating that the centerlines of streets, easements, and survey
monuments are located as denoted on the final plat.
7.   When public infrastructure improvements for a subdivision are accepted by
Council for maintenance and operation, the developer shall provide all
approvals from all appropriate regulatory agencies (for example, ADEQ Approval
of Construction) and shall provide a warranty or guarantee for a period of two
(2) years against defective materials and workmanship.
D.   Development of Plans and Specifications
The “Uniform Standard Specifications and Details for Public Works Construction”
as published by the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) are recognized as
acceptable construction specifications and standard details. Because of
variations in climate, soils, and availability of materials, modifications to
the MAG specifications may have been implemented by the Town. The MAG
specifications shall be utilized at the direction and approval of the Public
Works Director. Other pertinent manuals for the development of plans and
specifications include “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets”
as distributed by AASHTO; all design manuals, specifications, and standard
details as distributed by the Arizona Department of Transportation; all
engineering bulletins as distributed by the Arizona Department of Environmental
Quality; “Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways”
as distributed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration; and the various design manuals, procedures, and guidelines as
published by professional organizations and governmental agencies.
E.   Streets
1.   Except as specifically exempted for rural streets as set forth in these
Subdivision Regulations, a geotechnical report shall be required for the
pavement design of all subdivision streets. The design approach shall be based
on the latest methodology that is utilized by the Arizona Department of
Transportation or the American Association of Highway and Transportation
Officials.
Traffic volumes for the pavement design shall be based on a trip generation
analysis as developed by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.
2.   Portland cement concrete shall normally be used for all required curb and
gutter, valley gutters, and sidewalks unless otherwise approved by the Public
Works Director.
3.   A seal coat shall be required on all street paving projects. If pavement
cuts occur after the final lift of asphaltic concrete then a chip seal will be
required.
4.   The developer shall be responsible for the installation of all regulatory,
warning, and street signs for the orderly movement of vehicles and for public
safety. Regulatory and warning signs shall be in conformance Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices. Street signs shall be in accordance with Town
standards and include 911 or emergency addressing.
F.   Drainage
1.   Subdivider must show the limits of the one hundred (100)-year floodplain
on the final plat in a readily retraceable manner with frequent ties to
intersecting lot lines for all flows of fifty (50) cubic feet per second or
more.
2.   Watercourses that are relocated, altered, or include any man-made
improvements, should be developed with channel treatments that allow for the
reestablishment of vegetation. The use of concrete will be limited to
headwalls, cut-off walls, transitions, and areas with limited right-of-way
because of existing improvements. The placement of concrete structures shall be
at the discretion of the Public Works Director.
3.   Culverts for streets shall be designed to convey at the fifty (50)-year
peak discharge with no flow over the roadway. Additionally, the flow depth over
the street shall be limited to one (1.0) foot for one hundred (100)-year peak
discharge if the street provides all weather access.
4.   A minimum pipe diameter of eighteen (18) inches is required for all street
crossings and a minimum pipe diameter of twelve (12) inches is required for all
driveways.
5.   Culvert outlet velocities should be kept below fifteen (15) feet per
second unless approved by the Public Works Director due to special conditions.
The maximum velocity should be consistent with the channel stability
requirements at the culvert outlet. If the culvert velocities exceed
permissible velocities for the proposed outlet (greater than five (5) feet per
second for natural conditions depending on soil types), suitable outlet
protection must be provided.
6.   Drainage ditches or storm drains along streets and adjacent areas shall be
required to avoid trapping water and to ensure positive drainage away from the
streets. Street drainage shall be designed to provide for one (1) lane of
traffic on all local streets and one (1) lane of traffic in both directions for
all collectors and arterials for the ten (10)-year peak discharge.
G.   Water
1.   New water facilities shall be designed in accordance with the Arizona
Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and the Arizona Department of Health
Services Bulletin No. 10 (latest edition). Any deviation from the bulletin's
requirements shall have the written approval of the Public Works Director.
2.   All water mains shall be a minimum of six (6) inches in diameter, unless
designated otherwise by the Public Works Director, to ensure minimum water flow
requirements of the pressure zone or the Chino Valley Comprehensive Water
Master Plan.
3.   All water mains, valves, and fittings shall be constructed with materials
having a working pressure rating of two hundred (200) pounds per square inch.
4.   The longitudinal bending of water mains shall not be allowed. All changes
in direction or angle will require the appropriate fittings.
5.   All dead ends on new mains shall be provided with a blow-off cock in the
plug or cap, and reaction backing or thrust blocking shall be arranged not
encased or covered by the concrete, if used.
6.   Fire hydrants shall be spaced at a distance no greater than five hundred
(500) feet apart in residential areas and five hundred (500) feet apart in
commercial and industrial areas. The measurement between fire hydrants shall be
linear and the measurement will be effected along the centerline of the
streets. The Chino Valley Fire District may adjust the distances between fire
hydrants when circumstances dictate.
7.   The water system for the subdivision must be capable of supplying and
sustaining the required flows for fire protection throughout all subdivided
properties as approved by the Town. For residential areas, the minimum required
fire flow capability is one thousand (1,000) gallons per minute for a duration
of two (2) hours with a minimum system pressure of twenty (20) pounds per
square inch while the required fire hydrant flow rate is being met. For all
multi-family, industrial and commercial areas, the Chief Building Code
Official, in consultation with the Chino Valley Fire District, shall determine
minimum fire flow capability and that flow will be provided with a minimum
system pressure of twenty (20) pounds per square inch.
8.   The approval of the final design of the water system rests with the
Council and will be based on the conformity of the design to policy, standards,
and specifications. The subdivider is responsible for all approvals with ADEQ
and other regulatory agencies.
9.   The Town may issue building permits after the approval of the water system
and the installation of an all-weather road. Approval of the water system
requires that the water lines have been successfully pressure tested and
disinfected to Town standards and that fire flow can be provided to all
subdivided properties. An all-weather road for this purpose means that the sub-
grade and aggregate base material has been constructed to the approved plans
and specifications and the width of the road is a minimum of twenty (20) feet
wide. Water service shall not be connected to any structures until approval
from ADEQ is received.
10.   The Town will not issue any certificates of occupancy until the
subdivision improvements are accepted for maintenance and operation by Council.
H.   Sewer
1.   New sanitary sewerage facilities shall be designed in accordance with the
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and the Arizona Department
of Health Services Bulletin No. 11 (latest edition). Any deviations from the
bulletins requirements must have the written approval of the Public Works
Director.
2.   New sanitary sewers shall be designed to carry the designated peak wet
weather flow from the area that will be ultimately tributary to the respective
reach of sewer.
3.   No public gravity sewer lines shall be less than eight (8) inches in
diameter. All gravity sewer line pipes shall be of bell and spigot and gasketed
joints.
4.   The longitudinal bending of PVC SDR 35 sewer pipe is allowable with a
minimum allowable radius of one hundred-fifty (150) feet and no joint
deflection. Because longitudinal bending is allowable for PVC sewer pipe, drop
manholes shall be discouraged with elevational differences addressed by
vertical sweeps of the sewer main.
5.   Testing of gravity sewer lines and manholes may include multiple test
methods to ensure a minimum of inflow and infiltration. Sewer lines shall be
subject to but not limited to low pressure air testing, deflection testing, and
closed circuit TV inspection. Manholes, at a minimum, shall be vacuum tested
after the frame and cover are installed.
6.   Low pressure pipe shall be PVC SDR 21 with gasketed joints or HDPE SDR 11
with welded joints. Substitution may be provided if the pipe is of equal or
better quality.
7.   Low pressure sewer system shall be pressure tested in accordance with
applicable test procedures for potable water lines.
8.   The outfall for all low-pressure sewer systems shall include adequate
measures to prevent sulfide corrosion of manholes and to mitigate odors.
9.   Pump stations that are to be operated and maintained by the Town shall be
designed as a wet/dry well type system and include odor control, corrosion
mitigation measures, and supervisory/control and data acquisition systems.
10.   Sewer house service connections shall have adequate separation or
protection from potable water house service connections. Sewer service lines
should be installed at points ten (10) feet from the lowest lot corner adjacent
to the sewer main. Crossing of water and sewer service lines, especially a low-
pressure sewer with water service line, may require that the sewer service line
be sleeved.
11.   The Town will not issue any certificates of occupancy until the
subdivision improvements are accepted for maintenance and operation by Council.
