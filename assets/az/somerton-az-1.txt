the conduct of its business.
      4.   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by persons aggrieved
or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality affected by
a decision of the Zoning Administrator, within a reasonable time, by filing
with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying
the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall immediately transmit all
records pertaining to the action appealed from to the Board.
      5.   An appeal to the Board stays all proceedings in the matter appealed
from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board that, in the

would cause imminent peril to life or property. Upon the certification,
proceedings shall not be stayed, except by restraining order granted by the
Board or by a court of record on application and notice to the Zoning

in a decision made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this
article;
         b.   Hear and decide appeals for variances from the terms of this
article only if, because of special circumstances applicable to the property,
including its size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict
application of this article will deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by
other property of the same classification in the same zoning district. Any
variance granted is subject to the conditions as will assure that the
adjustment authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges
inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and
zone in which the property is located; and
         c.   Reverse or affirm the order, requirement, or decision of the
Zoning Administrator appealed from, and make the order, requirement, decision,
or determination as necessary.
      8.   A Board of Adjustment may not:
         a.   Make any changes in the uses permitted in any zoning district, or
make any changes in the terms of this article, provided the restriction in
division B.8.b. below shall not affect the authority to grant variances
pursuant to this article; and/or
         b.   Grant a variance if the special circumstances applicable to the
property are self-imposed by the property owner.
      9.   If the City Council is established as the Board of Adjustment, it
shall exercise all of the functions and duties of the Board of Adjustment in
the same manner and to the same effect as provided in this section.
      10.   A person aggrieved by a decision of the Board may, at any time
within 30 days after the Council has rendered its decision, file a complaint
for special action in the Superior Court to review the legislative body

SUBARTICLE I - GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 3-5-1 PURPOSE.
   A.   The purpose of our purchasing or procurement policy is to establish
fairness and uniformity among the city's departments and to ensure that
purchase of goods and services by the City of Somerton comply with all legal,
fiscal, and insurance requirements established by federal, state, or county
government. This article is intended to be used as a reference by city staff,
vendors, and the general public with respect to these policies. The policies
presented in this article have been reviewed and approved by the City Council,
and should be used to determine the appropriate policies to be followed for a
particular procurement. In cases where this policy does not address a
particular situation, the Arizona State Procurement Code found in A.R.S. Title
41 will be followed. A glossary is attached to the end of this article for the
reference of readers. The Council reserves the right to amend or change these
policies and any subsequent changes to these policies shall be incorporated by
reference into all contracts with the city.
   B.   More specifically, the purchasing policies strive for the following
goals:
      1.   Maximization of competition. In order to be responsible to the
public, these specifications are written to allow the purchasing process to be
as open as possible to a number of qualified vendors.
      2.   Equal and fair competition. It is our goal that vendors are provided
the same information regarding the availability of contracts, and products or
service needs and specifications and their responses such as price quotes are
kept confidential until the purchases are completed and so no favoritism is
shown in the purchasing process.
      3.   Predictability. City staff has a clear indication of the rules for
the type of purchase in question so that their time and efforts are best
utilized.
      4.   The best value at the lowest price. The money available for city
services is maximized so that purchases are made the lowest price for the
product or service that best meets the needs of the city.
      5.   Ethical procedures. To prevent and/or disclose conflicts of interest
between vendors on the part of city staff, elected officials and/or appointed
officials.
      6.   Budget responsibility. To ensure that expenditures do not exceed the
funds allocated through the city's budgetary process.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-2 APPLICABILITY/EXCLUSIONS.
   All city agencies, elected officials and employees are subject to this
policy. This policy shall be incorporated by reference into all contracts and
any purchases ordered or contracts entered into with the city and contrary to
the provision hereof shall not be binding upon the city unless later ratified
in accordance with these procedures. Employees, agents, appointed or elected
officials making expenditures outside of these authorized procedures, or
without full ratification of the City Council, may result in their own personal
liability.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-3 AUTHORITY.
   A.   The City Council is the only entity of the City of Somerton that has
the legal authority to incur financial, legal, and other obligations on behalf
of the city, its agencies, employees, and elected officials. To ensure fiscal
control, the City Council must approve all contracts or specifically authorize
a designated elected or appointed official to enter into contracts as provided
in Somerton City Code, §
3-4-4, division I.
   B.   The City Council has delegated purchasing authority according to
certain parameters and subject to the procedures outlined herein. Variations
from these general parameters require one of the following:
      1.   Specific approval of City Council;
      2.   Specific authority in Arizona Revised Statutes; or
      3.   The City Manager may approve emergency or field expediency purchases
to personnel in other city departments, as specified in Subarticle VIII below,
provided the delegation is limited, specific, and subject to immediate
revocation.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-4 CONTRACT PREPARATION.
   All purchases of goods and services must be made pursuant to written
contracts, executed in the name of the City of Somerton by the Mayor or City
Manager; except as it may be otherwise be provided other by this policy or by
law. Except for the city's standard purchase orders and blanket purchase orders
(see below), all contracts shall be reviewed and approved as to form by the
City Attorney.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-5 CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION.
   A.   The department assigned as the "contracting department" shall be
responsible for monitoring contract performance unless otherwise designated by
the City Manager. Each department director will keep the City Manager up to
date on the status of all contracts.
   B.   Oversight of the purchasing policies will be shared among the several
departments as follows.
      1.   The City Manager has the authority to issue invitations for formal
bids and requests for proposals, and may delegate this authority to one or more
department directors in writing.
      2.   The Public Works Director shall coordinate and manage the disposal
of the city's surplus and obsolete materials and equipment.
      3.   The Administrative Services Director will develop the specific
procedures necessary for the purchasing process.

and/or services.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-6 ROLE OF PURCHASING AGENT.
   The primary role of the purchasing agent is it is to expedite the purchasing
process through the best sources and at the best prices consistent with
quality, delivery, services and any local vendor performance that may occur.
The purchasing agent is generally not empowered to approve or disapprove a
purchase - that is the role and duty of City Council, City Manager, and the
department directors and other designated supervisors. The purchasing agent
does have disapproval authority for items not appropriate to the department's
mission, not deemed to be a necessary purchase, for which the vendor has shown
non-performance previously, duplications and/or obvious miss-orders.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-7 CONTRACT PERFORMANCE MONITORING.
   A.   The purchasing agent and the ordering department are jointly obligated
to ensure that compliance with the purchase order or other contract has been
met prior to payment to any supplier or vendor. The purchasing agent shall be
authorized to take appropriate actions against suppliers when contract terms
are not satisfactorily performed, and the assistance of all the city
departments benefitting from such contracts is very important in this regard.
   B.   In order to ensure the follow-up, the purchasing agent will be
responsible to maintain records and notes sufficient to complete the following
tasks:
      1.   Maintain, in an accessible format, a records of the specific goods,
work, or services ordered, including performance requirements;
      2.   Establish a tickler system of which review all items delivered
pursuant to purchase order to ensure the receipt or lack of receipt of the
goods, work, or services; and
      3.   Report completion and/or non-performance to the contracting
department within 15 days of the contract completion date.
   C.   In the event the goods or services are not furnished by the required
due date, or is delayed such that the purchasing agent anticipates non-
completion by the required due date, the requesting department should contact
the supplier to determine the reasons for delay and identify when the goods or
services will be furnished. In the event the supplier indicates that they do
not intend to furnish the goods or services, or the reason for the delivery
delay is not acceptable, the purchasing agent will immediately cancel the
purchase order.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-8 VENDORS LIST.
   The City of Somerton does not maintain vendors' lists. Vendors may submit
data relating to their products at any time, which is on file in the purchasing
agent's office. Department directors are responsible to keep themselves up-to-
date regarding sources of supplies for their needs.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE II - PURCHASING PROCEDURES
§ 3-5-20 ACQUISITION OF GOODS, MATERIALS, AND NON-PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
   A.   To ensure the city's compliance with budget restrictions, and the
availability of funds for essential services, purchasing procedures exist which
require that all purchases for service and commodities and/or goods must be
initiated by a purchase order and handled via the purchase order process with
the exception of petty cash purchases, and specialized contract services set
out in §
3-5-25 below.
   B.   The amount of cost analysis and procedural formality required by these
policies varies with the specifics of each transaction, including the amount of
money, the type of goods and services, the availability of competing vendors,
and the urgency of the matter for which goods and/or services are sought.
   C.   In making a purchase, city staff and/or officials should ensure
compliance with the procedures with respect to all of the following aspects:
      1.   Who has the authority to make the purchasing decision;
      2.   How to obtain complete and competitive information about the
availability of and the pricing for products and services;

      4.   How to receive communications from vendors as to their prices and
services in order to obtain the information in a form which will provide useful
comparative information;

(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-22 PURCHASE ORDERS.
   A.   1.   A purchase order is a standardized contract between the City of
Somerton and a vendor or supplier for the procurement of equipment, supplies,
services, materials, and the lease/purchase or rental of equipment. The city
has no obligation for purchases made without an authorized purchase order
despite any pattern of previous purchases from a vendor or supplier or based on
prior purchasing history.
      2.   Department directors are responsible for maintaining budget and
purchase integrity. No person will submit a purchase order for goods or service
without sufficient approved funds available to meet the purchase obligations.
This practice applies to all purchase orders regardless of the source of
funding. Department directors are responsible for approving and/or disapproving
budget requests within their areas consistent with overall guidelines
established by the City Manager.
      3.   All purchase orders must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate
operating department director or supervisor to determine that budgeted funds
are available to cover the purchase. Operating departments are fully
responsible for establishing internal controls to assure that sufficient funds
exist within their budget to cover all purchases.
   B.   1.   General information. Except in emergencies, the Administrative
Services Department will only allow a purchase order after receipt of an
approved purchase requisition from a user department. The purchase order will
be completed per the most recent approved procedure.
      2.   Blanket purchase orders. The use of blanket purchase orders must be
very limited, or control over expenditures and economy in purchasing will
decrease since these purchase orders do not encumber existing budgeted funds
and therefore increase the risk of budget shortfalls.
         a.   Blanket purchase orders may be used for purchases that require
multiple payments and/or deliveries for undetermined amounts such as automotive
repair parts or when more than one department is sharing the costs of the goods
or services.
         b.   Only Accounting may initiate blanket purchase orders. Departments
requesting a blanket purchase orders must place the order in writing, and,
absent the following terms, will not be approved:
            i.   A statement as to why a standard purchase order does not
suffice;
            ii.   An explanation of the period covered; and
            iii.   A "not to exceed amount" to be purchased during the period.
      3.   Ratification of purchases not authorized by purchase order.
         a.   Conforming purchase orders will be accepted only on a proven
emergency basis and must be submitted to the purchasing agent the next work
day. Invoices received without valid purchase order should be returned to the
vendor informing them to contact and collect from individual who placed the
unauthorized order.
         b.   Accounts Payable shall be required to verify invoice dates
against the date the purchase order was authorized prior to approving payment
of a purchase order. All purchases not approved prior to the placement of the
order will be returned to the department concerned.
      4.   Amendments to purchase orders. Employees will not add items to a
purchase order once approved without the prior approval of the purchasing
agent. Added items not approved in advance will be handled as outlined in this
section above.
      5.   Failure to fill purchase order within 90 days. If a purchase order
is not filled within 90 days of issuance without notification from the
supplier, or if prior arrangements for specified delivery time have been made,
that purchase order may be canceled. The Finance Department will discuss this
with the requesting department prior to canceling an order.
      6.   Insufficient funds. If the account to which the purchase order
applies lacks a sufficient balance to pay the funds necessary to complete the
purchase, the order will be referred to the Administrative Services Director.
If required the City Manager will review the proposed expenditure and if
warranted notify the department director that he or she has the following
courses of action he or she may take:
         a.   Withdraw the request;
         b.   Request a transfer of funds in budgeted accounts;
         c.   Request a budget supplement to cover cost of purchase order. Such
a budget transfer of supplement funds must be fully explained by the department
director and then placed on Council agenda for formal Council action.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-23 BID REQUIREMENTS; FORMAL BID AND QUOTE LEVELS.
   A.   To ensure competition for pricing, three price quotes must generally be
obtained prior to selecting a vendor. In some cases, the city official or staff
must make the request for a price quote in writing and in some cases the
requests for price quotes may be made orally. In some cases, the price quote
must be received in writing, in some cases the quoted price may be received
orally and later placed in writing through the requisitioning process. In some
cases, the request for quotes must contain very specific information about the
scope of the work and other matters, in some cases it need not.
   B.   Again, the cost analysis and procedural formality required by these
policies varies with the specifics of each transaction, including the amount of
money, the type of goods and services, the availability of competing vendors,
and the urgency of the matter for which goods and/or services are sought. These
rules are set out below:
      1.   Expenditures over $1,000.00. Any expenditure over $1,000.00 shall
require three price quotes. The price quotes may be given orally, that is, they
need not be put into writing, and the request for the price quote may also be
put in writing but need not be.
      2.   Expenditures over $3,000.00. The departments or purchasing agent
must receive three written price quotes from vendors in response to a complete
set of written specifications or scope of work for acquisitions from $3,000.01
to $30,000. The department directors or purchasing agent must have a set of
written specifications or scope of work, list of vendors contacted and all
written responses or non-responses from vendors on file. For any procurement
between $10,000.00 and $30,000.00 a copy of the written specification or scope
of work and all written responses must be retained by the using department or
the purchasing agent.
      3.   Expenditures over $30,000.00. In addition to the requirements for
all expenditures over $3,000.00, if the expenditure exceeds $30,000.00 the bids
must be sealed and must pursue a competitive process. (Exceptions exist as set
out below.)
   C.   Summary chart of requisition and price quotes.
 
Required Requisitions and Price Quotes
$1,000.01 to $3,000.00  3 verbal (oral) quotes
$3,000.01 to $30,000.00 3 written quotes
Above $30,000.00        Sealed competitive bids
 
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-24 PERSONAL SERVICE AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS; EXEMPTIONS FROM
REQUISITION SUBMISSION.
   Certain types of services, such as personal services contracts, which are
highly specialized, are exempt from the competitive sealed process, since there
are many other factors which must be considered in making a choice of vendors
such as experience, availability, staffing levels, licensing, and insurance.
These are set out below.
   A.   Acquisition of architectural and engineering services. The employment
of an architect on projects less than $250,000 or engineering, landscape
architect, assayer, geologist or land surveyor for projects less than $500,000
may be selected by direct selection, or a Qualifications Based Selection (QBS)
system. For projects exceeding $250,000 for architects, or engineering,
landscape architects, assayers, geologists, and land surveyors projects
exceeding $500,000 the QBS process must be used. These processes and
definitions are discussed in Subarticle IV, §
3-5-97.
   B.   Acquisition of legal services.
      1.   $1,000.01 qualified vendor.  For the cost of goods and/or services
over $1,000 for any legal services the vendor must be "qualified" to provide
those legal services through accreditations, certifications, or defined by
state statute.
   .   2.   Approval required. All elected officials, volunteers, and employees
must have approval from the City Manager, City Attorney's Office and the City
Council in order to obtain legal services outside the City Attorney's Office,
even if the services are on a pro-bono basis. The City Magistrate, City
Attorney, and City Prosecuting Attorney may, in accordance with the city
purchasing policy, acquire legal services in the discharge of their regular
duties as required by statute. All legal services required by the City
Magistrate, City Attorney, and City Prosecutor outside the regular course of
business require approval of the City Manager, City Attorney, and City Council.
   C.   Acquisition of other professional services.
 
$1,000.01 to $3,000.00 3 verbal proposals
3,000.01 to $30,000.00 3 written proposals
Above $30,000.00       Formal RFP process
 
   D.   Acquisition of construction contracts. Construction contracts will be
awarded through a solicitation of bids in accordance with A.R.S. Title 34.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-25 INTERNAL CONTROLS; REQUISITIONS FOR ITEMS GREATER THAN $1,000.
   A.   In order to ensure that city funds are both available for a purchase,
that the purchase is essential to the department's function, and to set aside
funds from the budget while payment is pending, an internal process exists
which requires items to be requisitioned. This procedure allows city
departments to obtain necessary equipment, materials, supplies and services,
and for the rental and leasing of equipment, when the anticipated cost is above
$1,000.
   B.   Requisitions must be entered into the financial management system and
approved by the City Manager, the Administrative Services Director, or the
purchasing agent depending upon level of approval prior to making purchases see
Subarticle II, §
3-5-21. An exception exists for emergency situations as set out below.
   C.   Requisitions convey to the vendor and the Administrative Services
Department exactly what the requesting department's needs are and provides a
method to check the availability of budgeted funds. Requesting departments
should make certain the requisition contains a description of the product or
service description in clear, concise and sufficient terms for the buyer to
make the proper purchase.
   D.   Requisitions that are properly created increase the efficiency of the
procurement process and reduce the time needed to process the requisition. The
requisition will be completed per the most recent approved procedure.
   E.   Purchases that are exempt from requisition submission are:
      1.   Salaries and related costs; FICA, federal and state withholding tax,
workers' comp, employee retirement, and the like;
      2.   Visiting judges, and city court reporters;
      3.   Jury and witness fees (does not include expert witness);
      4.   Travel (utilize per diem request and receipts for reimbursement);
      5.   Utilities: telephone, gas, electric, water, and the like;
      6.   Uniform allowances for Public Safety;
      7.   Intergovernmental service department charges; photocopier,
mechanical;
      8.   Expenditures from petty cash (when replenishing the Petty Cash Fund

a requisition) except for credit card purchases of $1,000 or less accompanied
by receipts;
      10.   Emergency purchases of low-cost items. These may, in certain
circumstances, be purchased directly by user departments;
      11.   Insurance settlements/payments (utilize a check request);
      12.   Contracts approved for formal processing (process progress payments
utilizing a check request);
      13.   State sales tax (utilize a check request);
      14.   Postage machine replenishment;
      15.   Bulk fuel deliveries for gasoline and diesel;
      16.   Employee cell phone reimbursement (use check request);
      17.   Employee reimbursement for safety boots (use check request); and
      18.   Others, as approved by the City Council.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-26 SPECIAL ITEMS; CHECK REQUESTS.
   A check request is used to pay for travel and per diem expenses, replenish
petty cash, make insurance payments, payment of contract services already
approved via the purchase order process (liability), security deposit
reimbursement City Council donations. This list is not all inclusive but
provides basic guidelines for its use. See

accountability of the funds at all times. This temporary receipt may be removed
from the Fund after the purchase transaction has been completed and a balance
has been reached.
   D.   To maintain an adequate cash balance, the employee maintaining the
actual Fund will provide to the City Manager a statement showing the actual
expenditures from each charge made out of the Petty Cash Fund and the City
Manager shall approve via a check request reimbursement for expenditures from
time to time as may be required.
   E.   The allocation of petty cash is made through the budgetary process, but
the maximum amount of cash maintained on-site in the petty cash fund at any
given time is as follows:
 
$200                                 Finance Department

offending department.
   G.   Purchases may be made from the Petty Cash Fund when:
      1.   The item is not carried in the city's inventory;
      2.   The cost of the purchase is not greater than $30; and
      3.   It represents an unusual emergency or infrequent expenditure.
   H.   Exclusions. Purchase or expenses generally prohibited from the Petty
Cash Fund are:
      1.   Items available from the city's inventory;
      2.   Expenditures for more than $30 except with prior approval of the
purchasing agent;
      3.   Payment to employees for services of any kind (salaries must be paid
through regular payroll procedures);
      4.   Payment supported by an unauthorized, uncertified copy or
reproduction of an invoice or receipt;
      5.   Mileage;
      6.   Employees' travel expenses;
      7.   Subscriptions, dues, memberships, registrations and tuitions; and
      8.   Items of a personal nature, which are not generally furnished by the
city.

the fiscal year. Department directors are responsible to maintain a current and
up-to-date inventory list at all times.
   B.   Items purchased that become part of the city's assets, cost over $5,000
and capitalized will be so marked on the purchase order to allow the Accounting
Department to identify those items and automatically add them to the city
master asset list (capitalized).
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-41 PURCHASE ORDER DELIVERY FOLLOW-UP.
   A.   The purchase is complete only when satisfactory performance by the
supplier has resulted. An interruption or delay in city activities or schedule
through failure as any other default and in addition is unfair to the
unsuccessful bidders, and authority for payment is granted subject only to the
contract terms.
   B.   Payment for goods and services will only be made for goods received or
services performed in a manner which is in conformance with the contract terms
including delivery of goods and/or services:
      1.   At the appropriate time;
      2.   In the appropriate place;

   The first task which must be completed when a department wishes to purchase
an item with a total cost in excess of $30,000 is the preparation of a bid
specification. The specification will be written by the requesting department.
If the item or service required is of a specialized nature, the specification
may be written by the department and sent to the purchasing agent for editing.
Every effort should be made to ensure that the specification provides potential
suppliers with a description which is complete and accurate without being
overly restrictive. Completed bid specification packets including purchase

      1.   The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but
the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or

to be evaluated for possible award.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-68 LATE BIDS.
   The call for bids states the date, time and place assigned for the opening

      5.   Correct, add to or clarify specifications.
   B.   The addendum shall be sent to all persons to whom the Purchasing Office
has sent bid packets. The addendum shall require that the bidder acknowledge

addendum, the city may waive the requirement as informality, if the vendor's
proposal shows that the information given in the addendum has been addressed.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-70 BID AND PERFORMANCE/PAYMENT BONDS.
   A.   Bid and performance and payment bonds are normally not required for
supplies, materials, equipment, and professional services. However, these bonds
or professional liability insurance may be required for nonprofessional service
contracts at the discretion of the Administrative Services Director, and shall
be required for contracts for the construction of buildings and public
improvements. Bids submitted without bonding requirements will be automatically
rejected.
   B.   Performance and payment bonds are binding on the parties upon execution
of the contract. Performance/payment bonds must be executed by a surety company
authorized to do business in the State of Arizona. In lieu of a bid bond, the
bidder may submit a certified check or cashier's check.
   C.   When a bid bond is required, the bonds of the three lowest bidders are
retained in a locked vault by the City Clerk until award of the bid is made by
the City Council. However, a bidder other than the three low bidders, who has
deposited a bond/surety, may request his or her bid deposit be returned prior
to the award. If the bid is for a procurement for which a contract is required,
the three low deposits will be retained until the contract is executed and
filed in the City Clerk. In case a performance and payment bond is required,
the deposit will be held until the terms of the contract are completed.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-71 RESPONSIBILITIES OF BIDDERS AND OFFERORS.
   A.   Determination of non-responsibility. If a bidder or offeror who
otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found non-responsible, a
written determination of non-responsibility, setting forth the basis of the
finding, shall be prepared by the purchasing agent. The unreasonable failure of
a bidder or offerors to promptly supply information in connection with an
inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of
non-responsibility with respect to the bidder or offerors. Factors which may be
considered in determining if a prospective contractor is responsible may
include but not be limited to:
      1.   The proposed contractor's financial, physical, personnel or other
resources, including subcontracts;
      2.   The proposed contractor's record of performance;
      3.   Whether the proposed contractor is legally qualified to contract
with the City of Somerton; and
      4.   Whether the proposed contractor has supplied all necessary
information concerning his, her, or its responsibility.
   B.   Final determination.  The final determination is made by the purchasing
agent and shall become part of the contract file and is made a public record.
The purchasing agent may establish specific responsibility criteria for a
particular procurement. Any specific responsibility criteria shall be stated in
the solicitation. All vendors shall be required to complete a disclosure of
responsibility statement and an affidavit of non-collusion when submitting bids
and proposals. See Appendices
A and
B.
   C.   Nondisclosure. The city shall not disclose information regarding
responsibility furnished by a bidder or offerors pursuant to this section.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-72 IDENTICAL BIDS.
   In the event that two or more bidders offer identical bids, all bids may be
rejected and new bids invited, unless it is deemed in the best interest of the
city to award the bid to one of the tied bidders by using the drawing of lots
in a public place, or to split the award if it is agreeable to both bidders and
will not result in added cost to the city.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-73 REJECTION AND CANCELLATION OF BIDS.
   A.   The City Council reserves the right to reject any and all bids if it
considers it to be in the best interest of city. Prior to opening, a
solicitation may be canceled in whole or in part when it is determined, in
writing, that the action is in the city's best interest for reasons including,
but not limited to:
      1.   The city no longer requires the proposed procurement;
      2.   The city can no longer reasonably expect to fund the procurement; or
      3.   Proposed amendments to the solicitation would be of such magnitude
that a new solicitation is desirable.
   B.   When a solicitation is canceled prior to opening, notice of
cancellation shall be sent to all businesses solicited. The notice of
cancellation shall identify the solicitation, the reason for cancellation, and
where appropriate, explain that an opportunity will be given to compete on any
re-solicitation or any future procurement.
   C.   A solicitation may be canceled after opening, but prior to award when
all bids or proposals are rejected in whole or in part, or when it is
determined in writing that the action is in the best interest of the city.
Reasons for which a solicitation may be canceled after opening include, but are
not limited to the following:
      1.   The procurement is no longer required;
      2.   Ambiguous or otherwise inadequate specifications were part of the
solicitation;
      3.   The solicitation did not provide for consideration of all factors of
significance to the city;
      4.   Prices exceed available funds and it would not be appropriate to
adjust quantities to come within available funds;
      5.   All otherwise acceptable bids or proposals received are at clearly
unreasonable prices; or
      6.   There is reason to believe that the bids or proposals may not have
been independently arrived at in an open competition, may have been collusive,
or may have been submitted in bad faith.
   D.   A recommendation to reject any or all bids is documented by means of an
explanatory letter from the purchasing agent to the City Manager on a City
Council agenda form. The reason for cancellation or rejection shall be made
part of the bid file and available for public inspection.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-74 BID EVALUATION AND AWARD.
   A.   After the bid opening, the requesting department will prepare a
detailed tabulation of all bids, which will then be reviewed by the purchasing
agent. In case of a difference between the unit prices and extended totals in a
bid, the unit price shall prevail. In case of a difference between written
words and figures in a bid, the amount stated in written words shall govern.
All relevant state and local, and use taxes shall be included in the final bid
amount shown as this is the amount that will be used for purposes of bid
evaluation. After reviewing the bids with the department originating the
request and the bid evaluation committee (if such a committee is being used),
the department will submit a recommendation for award to the lowest responsive,
responsible bidder. The recommendation must go through the purchasing agent for
review, then to the City Council on a City Council agenda form.
   B.   No criteria may be used in bid or proposal evaluation that is not set
forth in the bid documents.
   C.   Upon receiving a recommendation for award (or rejection of bids), the
purchasing agent will, in writing, notify all offerors of the recommendation.
If the low bid is found to be unacceptable, justification will be submitted in
writing to the City Manager. The recommendation to the City Council must
contain detailed explanations as to how or why the low bid was unacceptable.
The city reserves the right to waive any minor informality in accepting and
awarding of bids.

§ 3-5-75 PROTEST OF AWARD.

      3.   The possible remedies would unfairly prejudice other interested
parties, impact the integrity of the procurement system, or have a serious
detrimental affect on the good faith of the parties, cost to the city, the
urgency of the procurement, and the impact of the relief upon the using
department.
   C.   The purchasing agent shall place the decision in writing directed by
mail to the address provided by the protester and shall respond within 15 days.
   D.   The purchasing agent shall have the authority to sustain the protest in

award shall be stayed and an appropriate remedy shall be implemented.
   E.   In determining an appropriate remedy, the purchasing agent shall confer
with the Administrative Services Director and shall consider all the
circumstances pertaining to the proposed procurement including but not limited
to: the seriousness of the procurement deficiency, the degree of prejudice to
other interested parties or to the integrity of the procurement system, the
good faith of the parties, cost to the city; the urgency of the procurement;
and the impact of the relief upon the contracting department.
   F.   An appropriate remedy may include one or more of the following:
      1.   Withdraw staff recommendation, and reissue the solicitation;
      2.   Withdraw staff recommendation, and issue a new solicitation;

§ 3-5-76 CHANGE ORDERS - CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.
   A.   The city, without invalidating the contract, may order changes in the
work within the general scope of the contract consisting of additions,
deletions, or other revisions; the contract sum and the contract time being
adjusted accordingly. All such changes in the work shall be authorized by
change order, and shall be performed under the applicable conditions of the
contract documents. The change order will be initialed by the project
architect/engineer with his or her recommendation and forwarded to the city for
approval or rejection.
   B.   The contractor shall bear any additional fees and costs incurred by the
owner, architect, engineer, or consultant for fees as a result of a change
order which adjusts the contract time and which is not because of any act or
omission of the owner, architect, engineer or consultant.
   C.   The cost or credit to the owner resulting from a change in the work
shall be determined in one or more of the following ways:
      1.   By unit price stated in the original contract documents.
      2.   By cost, as deemed below, properly itemized and supported by
sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation, plus a fee of 10% designed
to compensate the contractor for overhead and administrative costs. Specific
costs shall be itemized by crafts defined within the schedule of values and
limited to the following items directly allocable to the change in work:
         a.   Cost of materials, including cost of delivery;
         b.   Cost of labor, including, but not limited to, social security,
and unemployment insurance and fringe benefits required by agreement and
workers' compensation insurance;
         c.   Rental value of equipment and machinery;
         d.   Sales tax, insurance and bond premiums; and

under division C.2. above.
   D.   All change orders within amounts appropriated in the current fiscal
year budget for the subject of the bid award will be authorized and executed in
the following manner:
      1.   Authority to approve change orders is subject to the following
cumulative per project limits:
 
$5,000 or less       Project Manager
$5,000 up to $10,000 Department Director
$10,000 to $30,000   City Manager
$30,000 and above    City Council
 
      2.   For example, if the Project Manager is asked to approve $1,000
change orders, he or she can only do so up to five times. If the five change
orders are $3,000 each, the department director must approve the second and
third change order and the City Manager must approve the fourth change order,
as the cumulative amount exceeds $10,000. In addition, the City Manager must
then approve all subsequent change orders within the approved contract. A
change order tabulation sheet must be submitted showing all change orders
incurred for a project along with each request for approval of a change order.
   E.   If any change order causes the total expenditures on a project to
exceed the amount of the contract for that project approved by the City
Council, then the City Council must approve that change order. The City Council
must approve any single change order exceeding $30,000.
   F.   For equipment, goods, and services, all change orders within amounts
appropriated in the current fiscal year budget for the subject of the bid award
will be authorized and executed in the following manner. If the change order is
for less than $10,000, the department director will have authority for approval
or rejection. If the change order is between $10,000 and $30,000, the City
Manager's approval is needed. If the change order exceeds $30,000, the City
Council will have the final authority to sign the change order. If any change
order exceeds the current fiscal year budget for the subject project, the City
Council must approve it. The City Council reserves the right to adjust these
authorized approval amounts for each individual project.

   E.   Proposals for competitive negotiations shall not be subject to public
inspection until negotiations between the city and all offerors have been
concluded and a contract awarded to the responsible offeror submitting the
proposal determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city, price,
and the evaluation factors set forth in the advertisement and solicitations for
proposals considered.
   F.   The purchasing agent shall examine each written proposal received for
general conformity with the advertised terms of the procurement. If it has been
provided in the advertisement or solicitation for proposals that an award may
be made without written or oral discussion, the City Council may, upon the
basis of the written proposals received, award the contract to the responsible
offeror submitting the proposals determined in writing to be the most
advantageous to the city, price, and the published evaluation factors
considered. If after the proposals have been examined, it is determined that
written and/or oral discussions should be had with the offerors, the purchasing
agent shall determine in writing, based on an individual review, those selected
for award of contract for the procurement. Each offeror shall be contacted
informally by the purchasing agent and a meeting scheduled for discussion of
the offeror's proposals.
   G.   Discussion with offerors shall be held informally and may be conducted
orally, in writing, or both. If, however, after discussion with all responsible
offerors have concluded or after examination of written proposals initially
submitted, it is determined that no acceptable proposal initially submitted,
any or all proposals may be rejected and in the discretion of the City Council,
new proposal may be solicited as provided in this section on the basis of the
same or revised terms or the procurement may be abandoned.
   H.   The purchasing agent shall prepare a written summary of all oral
discussions in the competitive negotiations setting forth the date or dates of
discussions with all responsible offerors and the general substance of the
discussions. Verbatim records of the discussions shall not be required.

(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-80 OPTION PROVISION.
   A.   If a contract is to include an option for renewal, extension, or
purchase, the applicable option provision shall be included in the

the particular option.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-81 PUBLIC AWARD.
   After contract award by the City Council, all proposals shall be open for
public inspection except to the extent the withholding of information is

(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE IV - COMPETITIVE SEALED REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFPS)
§ 3-5-95 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Competitive sealed proposals are only to be used when the use of competitive
sealed bidding is either not practical or not advantageous to the city as
determined by the Purchasing Office. This process is generally used for the
procurement of professional and non-professional services.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-96 REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS.
   A.   Professional and/or other services with an estimated value of $30,000
or more shall be procured through a formal request for proposals. The procedure
for formal request for proposals is established for the purpose of providing an
alternative method to sealed competitive bid for the purchase of professional
and other services. The procedural guidelines outlined in Subarticle III, §§
3-5-61 through
3-5-81 of competitive sealed bids, also apply to RFPs. As with formal bids, the
user department initiates the process and assists the purchasing agent in
creating a specification, called a "Scope of Services".
   B.   When the RFP is ready, notice of the RFP is published in the newspaper
for four consecutive days, and copies of the notice of RFP are sent to the
current contractor (if applicable) and all those who have registered with the
city as potential providers for the required services.
   C.   Proposals will be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the
request for proposal. The request for proposal will include a statement of how
the proposals will be evaluated, the relative importance of price and other
factors, the general terms of the written contract, and that professional
liability insurance may be required.
   D.   Questions from offerors regarding any clarifications of the RFP will be
answered prior to the opening. If any question results in a change to the scope
of work, an addendum will be made and distributed to all offerors who have
requested a bid packet. Discussions with proposers may also be conducted after
the opening. In conducting the discussions, no disclosure of other proposals
shall be made.
   E.   Prior to award, the city may issue a written request for best and final
offers. The request shall state the date, time, and place for the submission of
the best and final offers. Best and final offers shall be requested only once
unless the purchasing agent makes a written determination that it is
advantageous to the city to conduct further discussions or change the city
requirements. The request shall inform offerors that, if they do not submit a
notice of withdrawal or a best and final offer, their immediately previous
offer will be construed as their best and final offer.
   F.   All persons who submitted a proposal shall be given the opportunity to
submit a best and final offer if one is requested. The proposals will be
reviewed by the user department and the Purchasing Office, or evaluation
committee. A recommendation will then be made to the City Council based on an
evaluation of all factors stated in the RFP.
   G.   Upon City Council approval, award shall be made to the responsible
offerors whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to
the city, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth
in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the
evaluation. The bid file shall contain the basis on which the award is made.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-97 SELECTION AND CONTRACTING OF ARCHITECTURAL-ENGINEERING PROFESSIONAL
SERVICES.
   A.   The services of architect and engineering related services may be
acquired through a qualifications based selection process, direct selection or
public competition.
      1.   Direct selection. Direct selection means the selection of one
technical registrant/firm without the requirement of advertising. For smaller
jobs where there is a preference for a qualified firm to perform the work, the
firm is simply notified and the parties negotiate a fair and reasonable
contract, and based on price is subject to approval by the City Council.
Contracting of architects and engineers (A/Es) by direct selection is
accomplished by selecting the consultant based on knowledge of his or her
qualifications and experience, agreeing on a negotiated scope of work and then
fixing the compensation. If agreement on scope of work or compensation cannot
be agreed upon, another consultant may be selected. Ranking of firms is not
required under this selection process.
      2.   Qualifications based system. Selection may also be made according to
a qualifications basis system (QBS). Dollar thresholds are defined in
Subarticle I, §
3-5-3. Firms engaged in the lawful practice of the profession may submit an
annual statement of qualifications (SOQ) and experience. A solicitation for
request for qualifications (RFQ) is also required based on a detailed scope of
work of the project. This RFQ will be advertised in the newspaper of general
circulation.
   B.   A selection committee is formed to evaluate the current SOQs on file
and RFQs. The committee should consist of at least three persons. The committee
shall select, in order of preference and based on criteria established, a short
list of at least three firms deemed to be the most qualified to provide the
services required. The selection of the short list must be based on
demonstrated competence and qualifications only. Fees, price, man-hours or any
other cost information may not be considered in the selection of the short
list.
   C.   After a short list is selected, negotiations may commence for a
contract with the highest rated firm for the required services. The
negotiations shall include consideration of compensation and other contract
terms and conditions the city determines to be fair and reasonable. In making
this determination, the city shall take into account the estimated value, the
scope, complexity, and nature of the required services. The negotiated contract
terms are subject to City Council approval based on contract dollar amounts as
defined in Subarticle II, §
3-5-23.
   D.   If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the highest rated
firm at a price or on other contract terms, negotiations shall be formally
terminated. Negotiations would then be started with the next highest rated
firm, in sequence, until an agreement is reached or a determination is made to
reject all firms on the short list.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-98 SELECTION AND CONTRACTING OF LEGAL SERVICES.
   The services of outside legal counsel when such services are recommended by
the City Attorney, Superior Court or conflict counsel, when such services are
recommended by the Public Defender, shall be acquired by the following process.
   A.   Persons engaged in providing legal services may submit statements of
qualifications and expressions of interest in providing such services. The city
may specify a uniform format that profiles qualifications and assures equal
opportunity for potential offerors. Persons may amend these statements at any
time by filing a new statement.
   B.   Whenever practicable, the city shall give adequate notice for the need
for such services. The notice shall describe the services required, list the
types of information and data required of each offeror and state the relative
importance of particular qualifications.
   C.   The city may conduct discussions with any offeror who has submitted a
proposal to determine the offeror's qualifications for further consideration.
Discussions shall not disclose any information derived from proposals submitted
by other offerors.
   D.   The provisions of this section are not applicable to contracts for
professional witnesses if the purpose of the contracts is to provide for
professional services or testimony relating to a criminal prosecution or an
existing or probable judicial proceeding in which the city is or may become a
party or to a contract for special investigative services for law enforcement
purposes.
   E.   All resultant contracts to the offerors determined in writing to be the
most qualified and after negotiation of compensation, determined to be fair and
reasonable, shall be placed before the City Council for award.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-99 OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
   All other professional service contracts shall be procured at the option of
the City Council by Council approval or through the competitive sealed RFP
process with pricing levels set in Subarticle II, §
3-5-24.
(Ord. 2014-003, passed 3-18-2014)
SUBARTICLE V - SUSPENSION AND DEBARMENT OF CONTRACTORS
§ 3-5-110 PURPOSE.
   For the protection of its citizens, the city excludes certain vendors or
suppliers from consideration for awards for City of Somerton contracts. This
action shall be based upon certain types of criminal convictions, civil

   D.   Violations of contract provisions of a character which are deemed to be
so serious as to justify debarment action, including, but not limited to, the
following:
      1.   Knowingly failing without good cause to perform in accordance with
the specifications or within the time limits provided; and
      2.   Failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance with the terms of
one or more contracts, except that failure to perform or unsatisfactory
performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor shall not be
considered to be a basis for debarment. A disclosure of responsibility form can
be found in
Appendix A. This form will be sent with each bid packet and must be returned by
the vendor with his or her proposal.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-113 WRITTEN DETERMINATIONS.
   A.   The Administrative Services Director shall make a written determination
to debar or suspend which shall be issued and contain:
      1.   The reasons for the action taken;
      2.   The action taken and the effective date and length of time the
action shall be in effect; and
      3.   Informing any debarred or suspended party involved of his or her
right to administrative appeal.
   B.   A copy of the decision shall be mailed or otherwise furnished to any
debarred or suspended party. A vendor may apply for reinstatement at any time
after the period of debarment has expired.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-114 PERIOD OF DEBARMENT.
   The period of time for debarment shall not exceed three years from the date
of the determination. If debarment is based solely upon debarment by another
governmental agency, the period of debarment may run concurrently with the
period established by the other debarring agency.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE VI - LEASING
§ 3-5-125 GENERAL INFORMATION.
   A.   A lease/purchase financing agreement is a contract by which one party
conveys property to another for a period of time in exchange for the payment of
interest and a portion of principal on the purchase price of the property.
Lease purchase agreement is authorized herein, subject to specific contract
review by the City Attorney.
   B.   Purchases made with lease purchase financing are made using the same
purchasing guidelines as other purchases, except that the use of lease/purchase

(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-127 RENTAL OF EQUIPMENT.
   Equipment should only be rented to fill short-term equipment needs. This may
include one-time, short-term needs or short-term needs that may be re-occurring
in which the rental of equipment is more cost effective than ownership of the
equipment.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-128 LEASE OF CITY PROPERTY.
   A.   The City Council has delegated authority to the City Manager to

(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE VII - SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT
§ 3-5-140 GENERAL INFORMATION.
   A.   A sole source purchase is the purchase of a commodity available from
only one supplier. A purchase of this type generally is of a special nature
because of the type of goods, materials, or services required by the user. The
requesting department will be required to justify, in writing, the reasons for
selecting a product or service that is available from a sole source only,
including obtaining the necessary City Council approval as indicated in
Subarticle II, §
3-5-23.
   B.   Sole source purchases are contrary to public purchasing procedures, and
therefore the selection of products or services of a sole source nature must be
limited as much as possible. The only justification for sole source purchases
are:
      1.   The purchase of a sole source item is to the city's best economic
interest; or
      2.   The items are generally classified as "captive" source items and
cannot be procured from other sources because of manufacturer marketing
arrangements, patents, and the like.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-141 SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.
   A.   When an item or service is required which is thought to be available
only from a single supplier, the following procedures shall be followed.
      1.   For purchases with an anticipated cost of $30,000 or less, a
purchase requisition shall be transmitted to the purchasing agent indicating
that only one source is known to exist. Efforts should be made by the
requesting department to locate any other possible sources, and the names of
those contacted who were unable to supply the required items or services shall
be noted in the comment section of the requisition. The purchasing agent will
review the requisition and attempt to identify any potential suppliers who are
not listed on the requisition. If no other source is found, a purchase order
will be issued to the sole supplier who is known to be capable of filling the
order.
      2.   Request for sole-source purchases with an anticipated cost of over
$30,000 shall be transmitted to the Purchasing Office in requisition form in
the same manner as above, with the names of potential suppliers, except for
proprietary purchases, who have been contacted by the requesting department
listed on the requisition.
   B.   The purchasing agent will attempt to locate any other potential
suppliers, and will publish notice of the proposed purchase in the newspaper
for four consecutive days, with a request that anyone who wishes to be
considered as a potential supplier contact the Purchasing Office. If any
supplier other than the one previously identified is found to exist, then the
purchase must be done through the formal bid process. If no other suppliers are
discovered, the Purchasing Office will notify the department who will then
submit a request for approval of the purchase to the City Council for
consideration as an agenda item. If the City Council approves the purchase, a
purchase order will be issued.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE VIII - EMERGENCY PURCHASES OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES
§ 3-5-155 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to enable the city to respond quickly in
procuring materials and/or services when an emergency condition exists.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-156 ACTIVITIES AUTHORIZED.
   A.   The City Manager may authorize others to make emergency procurements if
there exists a threat to public health, welfare, or safety, or if a situation
exists which makes compliance with §
3-5-60 impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to public interest. Emergency
procurements shall be made with as much competition as practicable under the
circumstances.
   B.   Any item that is procured under this emergency clause using the
reasoning that "a situation exists which makes compliance with §
3-5-60 impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to public interest" may be
considered as a one-time opportunity purchase and must:
      1.   Be capital equipment or capital equipment as part of a capital
project;
      2.   Clearly demonstrate that the price is significantly below market
price. Two other vendor quotes shall be required;
      3.   Receive City Manager approval prior to placing the order; and
      4.   Receive post acquisition approval from the City Council.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-157 PROCEDURES.
   There are separate procedures to be followed for emergencies occurring
during regular hours, and at all other times.
   A.   1.   From Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., all emergency
purchases are to be handled through the purchasing agent. Emergency purchases
will be left to the discretion of the department director.
      2.   For purchases over $30,000, the purchasing agent will advise the
City Manager of the emergency condition and request approval. The using
department shall provide whatever information or assistance is deemed
necessary. The operating department shall immediately transmit a purchase
requisition with "EMERGENCY" indicated in the comment section and the reasons
why the indicated acquisition is an emergency.
   B.   In the event the emergency occurs after regular working hours and
contact with the City Manager cannot be made, a department director may act for
the City Manager as outlined herein:
      1.   Emergency purchases of $30,000 or less may be authorized by the
responsible department director, and confirmed by transmitting a purchase
requisition marked "EMERGENCY" to the purchasing agent no later than noon of
the next normal working day following the purchase date. The department
director shall approve the purchase requisition and a brief but complete
explanation shall be included in the requisition to support the emergency
nature of the purchase.
      2.   Approval of emergency purchases of over $30,000 shall be limited to
the City Manager. A department may proceed under procedures as outlined in
division B.1. above, for purchases of over $30,000 without the prior approval
of the City Manager only in the most extreme emergency circumstances and only
after all efforts to contact the City Manager or an authorized delegate have
been exhausted. The City Manager must be notified as soon as possible of this
type of emergency procurement and a report must be drafted and forwarded to the
City Manager.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-158 DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY.
   A.   EMERGENCY is defined as: Where materials, services, or equipment are
needed for a situation where the health, safety, or welfare of the public is
endangered or the city is exposed to serious cost consequences if immediate
corrective or preventive action is not taken, or when needs arise after normal
working hours that cannot be postponed.
   B.   An emergency shall also exist when so declared in accordance with the
City Municipal Code. Any emergency procurement shall be limited to those
materials, services, or construction necessary to satisfy the emergency need.
   C.   To initiate an emergency purchase, the authorized person in the
department may call the purchasing agent for an order or authorization number.
They must state:
      1.   The nature of the emergency;
      2.   Vendor's name and address;
      3.   This must be followed up with a confirming purchase order the next
regular word day after the emergency purchase was made; and
      4.   The confirming purchase order should indicate the items were
purchased as "emergency" and date and time of purchase.
   D.   Realizing that most emergencies occur at night or on weekends when the
office is closed., employees are expected to have a senior supervisor verbally
approve the purchase of emergency items only, fix whatever the problem might be
and have the department director process the necessary paperwork the next
workday. Supervisors are reminded that only the minimum amount or items
necessary to take care of the emergency will be approved by the purchasing
agent.
   E.   1.   In the event of an emergency as described above the purchasing
agent may award contracts and make purchases for the purpose of meeting the
emergency.
      2.   As soon as possible after a contract is awarded or purchases made in
accordance with this section, the purchasing agent shall provide the Council
with a certificate showing:
         a.   Description of the emergency;
         b.   The necessity of the action; and
         c.   An itemized account of all expenditures.

SUBARTICLE IX – RECEIVING, INSPECTION, AND ACCEPTANCE OF MATERIALS, SUPPLIES,
AND SERVICES
§ 3-5-170 PURPOSE.
   Purpose is to establish for all departments the procedures for receiving,
inspecting and accepting equipment, materials, supplies, and services. The
purchase is complete only when satisfactory performance by the supplier has
occurred. Conformance to contracts includes time and place, as well as quantity
and quality. An interruption or delay in city activities or schedules due to
the failure to keep a promised delivery date is as uneconomical and harmful as
any other default, and in addition is unfair to the unsuccessful bidders.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-171 RECEIVING PROCEDURES.
   A.   The Purchasing Office and the Requisitioning Department share
responsibility for purchase order delivery follow-up.
   B.   The Requisitioning Department has responsibility for the following
activities:
      1.   Receive and thoroughly inspect all delivered equipment, materials,
and supplies;
      2.   Inspect the product or services to ensure the following:
         a.   Items are correct;
         b.   The quantities are correct;
         c.   All items are received in good condition; and
         d.   All items are delivered to the correct location.
      3.   Enter the information as to the quality, quantity, and timing of all
items into the financial software as a received and accepted item or items;
      4.   Upon discovery of a shipment that is not acceptable for any of the
reasons listed in divisions B.1. or B.2., to immediately contact the vendor and
provide him or her written notice of the defect, and to notify the Purchasing
Office and obtain its guidance for appropriate action;
      5.   If the defects are remedied within a reasonable time period, the
person should enter the quantities received in the financial software;
      6.   Back-ordered items should not be electronically received until they
actually arrive on site; and
      7.   When the full quantity of merchandise has not been received, but due
to various reasons the requesting department wishes to consider the order
complete, as is, the department should contact the Purchasing Office so that
they can cancel all back orders and consider the purchase order complete.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-172 PURCHASE ORDER DELIVERY FOLLOW-UP.
   A.   The Purchasing Office assists the Requisitioning Department when
requested, and takes appropriate actions against suppliers when necessary. The
assistance of the user departments is very important in this regard.
   B.   The prerequisite for purchase order delivery follow-up is prompt
knowledge of both the goods, work or services ordered, including performance
requirements; and the receipt or lack of receipt of the goods, work or
services. For this purpose, pertinent information must be available promptly
for persons responsible for delivery follow-up. Such information is identified
in the Purchase Order Inquiry screen in Caselle accounting software which shows
the vendor, purchase order number, goods or services ordered, and the delivery
due date. In the event the goods or services are not furnished by the required
due date, the requesting department should contact the Purchasing Office to
determine the reasons for delay and identify when the goods or services will be
furnished.
   C.   In the event the supplier indicates that they do not intend to furnish
the goods or services, or the reason for the delivery delay is not acceptable,
the Purchasing Office will take the necessary steps to secure the goods or
services, either from that supplier, or from another supplier.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-173 ENCUMBRANCES AND YEAR-END CUTOFF.
   A.   It is essential that city does not obligate itself for amounts in
excess of those budgeted, for a particular purpose. In an accrual accounting
system, all expenditures must be charged against the budget of the year in
which the goods or services are received. To achieve these goals, the budgetary
device of encumbering must be employed. An encumbrance does not result in the
recognition of an expenditure. It simply obligates or "reserves" a portion of
an unexpended budget for the purpose of paying a liability when the related
goods are received or services rendered. In the encumbrance system used by the
city, it will be necessary to encumber for all expenditures requiring a
purchase order.
   B.   At fiscal year-end, all outstanding encumbrances will be analyzed as to
status. All encumbrances for items which have not been received before June 30,
will be canceled, and, if desired and provided for in the new budget, re-
encumbered in the new fiscal year. Encumbrances for items that have been
received, or services which have been performed, but not yet paid at fiscal
year-end will be charged to the fiscal year in which the items were received,
or the services were performed. In order to accomplish a timely year-end
cutoff, purchase orders, other than emergencies, will not be issued after the
second week of May of each fiscal year. Departments should plan their
purchases, including those not requiring purchase orders, accordingly.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE X – CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
§ 3-5-185 PRINCIPLES.
   A.   Contract administration primarily consists of actions which must be
taken by the Purchasing Office from the time a contract is awarded until the
supplies, or services have been delivered and accepted, and payment has been
made. Once the purchase has been made or the contract awarded, the contract
administration function is the primary link between the supplier, the buyer,
and the using department, to handle problems arising from the procurement
action.
   B.   User departments are responsible for contract administration to assure
that the supplier delivers the product or service to the city user in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract issued by the
Purchasing Office.
   C.   To ensure consistent contractor compliance, the contract administration
includes, but is not limited to the following tasks:
      1.   Holding pre-performance conferences to emphasize city requirements
and contractor responsibilities under certain complex or critical contract
programs;
      2.   Follow up with the contractor and user department on problems
occurring during the period of performance. It is the responsibility of the
user department to document and keep records of vendor performance on
contracts. This information is crucial in determining contract extensions or
terminations;
      3.   Upon notification from departments, supported by documentation, a
letter of nonperformance will be sent to a vendor who has unsatisfactorily
performed on a city contract. This notice may state performance standards that
must be satisfied by a time indicated, quantity of goods to be provided, or
quality of service provided;
      4.   Follow-up on past due purchase orders and expedite delivery as
necessary;
      5.   Take necessary actions to amend existing contracts through required
approval channels;
      6.   Take necessary actions to terminate existing contracts, when
required, through approved channels; and
      7.   Resolve contract provision disputes within the authority limits
granted by the City Council, state statutes, and internal procedures.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-186 CONTRACTS.
   A.   A contract is a written agreement for the procurement or disposal of
supplies, services, insurance, equipment, or construction. To be effective, a
contract must include offer and acceptance by competent parties and the
furnishing of some good or service for an agreed monetary consideration.
   B.   All services provided to the city by outside agencies, firms, or
individuals shall be on a contractual basis. If the estimated annual cost of
services is over $30,000, the services shall be bid publicly and the contract
awarded and signed by the City Council. For services with an annual cost not to
exceed $30,000, a minimum of three written quotations shall be required, and a
contract signed with the successful company. The City Manager shall sign
contracts valued from $10,000 to $30,000 for cooperative purchasing agreement
contracts. The Administrative Services Director shall sign contracts with an
annual cost of between $3,000 and $10,000. The purchasing agent may sign
contracts from $1,000 to $3,000. Department directors may sign contracts for
under $3,000.
   C.   Generally the city utilizes only "fixed price" contracts, but might in
a special instance, because of market conditions, utilize a contract with price
increase provisions. A fixed price contract is used when the extent and type of
work necessary can be reasonably specified and the cost reasonably estimated.
Any time there is a price increase under these contracts, there must be
supporting documentation from the vendor showing an increased price for raw
materials from his or her supplier. Escalator clauses relating to the Consumer
Price Index may be included in the contract language.
   D.   REQUIREMENTS CONTRACTS are fixed price agreements set up to provide for
recurring purchases of indefinite quantities from the same supplier for a
specified period of time. The use of cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract is
prohibited. A cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost provides reimbursement to the
supplier for his or her actual cost plus an agreed-upon percentage of the costs
of the supplier's overhead and profit.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-187 MONITORING OF REQUIREMENTS CONTRACTS.
   A.   The Purchasing Office is responsible to ensure that the provisions of
requirements contracts are strictly adhered to by the contractor, and
monitoring by any city personnel authorized to place orders against the
contract.
   B.   Since the user department utilizes the contracted services or products,
they are in the best position to provide feedback information to the Purchasing
Office regarding specific contractor performance. Any questions or problems the
user has with a contract supplier must be brought to the attention of the
purchasing agent for resolution.
   C.   A vendor evaluation form should be completed for every contract
administered by the city. This form measures vendor product performance and may
be used as a source of evaluation criteria on future contracts. Forms to be
used to document vendor performance are included as exhibits in
Appendix C.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-188 PLACING ORDERS AGAINST EXISTING REQUIREMENTS CONTRACTS.
   A.   Only those individuals who have been specifically authorized by the
City Manager or Administrative Services Director can place orders against
existing requirements contracts. Only those items specifically defined in the
agreement can be purchased as a part of the agreements.
   B.   User departments who have not submitted their estimated quantity needs
for requirements contracts may not place orders against the existing agreement
without first receiving authorization from the Administrative Services
Director.
   C.   Each user department that has submitted its estimated needs and whose
requirements have been included in the contract shall monitor its ordered
material or service usage to ensure that they do not exceed the estimated
requirements. In the event that quantity limits will be exceeded, the user must
first request in writing to the purchasing agent that the specific requirements
contract be amended to include any additional quantities.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-189 TERMINATION OF A CONTRACT.
   A.   Terminating a contract is normally the last alternative after all other
administrative means have been sought to resolve a problem between the city and
a contractor. There are two reasons for terminating or canceling a city
contract: for convenience, and for cause (default).
      1.   Terminating for convenience. There are two types of terminations for
convenience used by the city: for the mutual convenience of the contractor and
the city; and for the unilateral convenience of the city.
         a.   Mutual convenience. An example of this type is where both parties
agree that the contractor is no longer able to provide the service or product
to the city under an existing contract. The Finance Director is responsible for
negotiating the final settlement formula regarding costs and date of
termination, and to prepare the recommended termination in accordance with the
terms of the existing contract, if applicable.
         b.   City convenience.  Depending upon the terms of the written
contract, this type of termination may occur whenever the city determines that
termination is in the best interests of the city or that funds are not
available.
      2.   Terminating for cause. 
         a.   This type of termination is employed when the contractor is in
default or breach of contract. Depending upon the situation and the terms of
the written contract, it is the city's standard practice that a cure notice be
sent via certified mail by the Purchasing Office to the contractor.
         b.   This notice shall set forth the details regarding the
deficiencies, with the dates and background information supporting non-
performance or substandard performance. The Finance Director establishes a firm
cure deadline date. The period must be of a reasonable length of time to cure
the deficiencies; normally the time period varies from ten to 30 days,
depending upon the individual circumstances of each case. Assuming the
contractor does not cure the deficiencies to the satisfaction of the city, the
Finance Director will then send a show cause letter by certified mail to the
contractor, wherein the contractor is requested to show cause why his or her
contract should not be terminated. The Finance Director will then establish
another deadline date for an answer to the show cause letter, usually five to
ten days. Unless the contractor shows sufficient cause why the contract should
not be terminated for cause, the Finance Director will initiate the necessary
steps to terminate the agreement and document the final action accordingly.
   B.   In all termination actions, the Administrative Services Director must
rely on the user department to provide the necessary documentation to justify
contractual decisions that are made. The using department personnel are the
"eyes and ears" of the city, expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction with
contractor performance. The Administrative Services Director either resolves
the problem or recommends termination of the appropriate contract to the City
Council.
   C.   The usual procedure for terminating a contract is by no means the
exclusive method. The action taken will always depend upon the written terms of
the contract, and the actual, factual situation presented. The city reserves
the right to employ all other available mechanisms and remedies to deal with a
breach of contract.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-190 CONTRACT PERIODS.
   Contracts should be for periods of time that coincide with the city's fiscal
year whenever practical. Contracts that span more than one fiscal year must
include language noting that the continuation of the contract is subject to
non-appropriation. Contracts may have renewal clauses, but should not exceed
three to five years.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-191 ADVERTISEMENTS FOR FORMAL CONTRACTS.
   Invitations for bid will be prepared in a concise manner consistent with
legal requirements, and describe the character of the proposed contract or
agreement in sufficient detail to enable the bidders to know what the general
scope will be, either in the advertisement itself or by reference to detailed
plans and specifications on file at the time of publication of the first
announcement.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-192 ARIZONA STATE CONTRACTS.
   A.   The City of Somerton has entered into a cooperative purchasing
agreement with the Purchasing Office of the State of Arizona, Department of
Administration, and Finance Division. This agreement permits the city to
purchase any supplies, commodities, equipment, services, and materials covered
by existing state contracts from consenting contractors. The city recognizes
substantial savings on every item bought through the state contracts.
   B.   Purchases from the Arizona state contracts are not subject to the
requirement for public bidding of any purchase with a value over $30,000, as
the State Purchasing Office has already publicly bid the commodities on the
contracts. Purchases of supplies, equipment, and services shall be made from
the state contracts whenever it is in the best financial interest of the city,
and the best overall value. Cost comparisons are not required when a purchase
is made from the state contracts; however, random comparisons are encouraged.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-193 INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT (IGA).
   A.   A cooperative purchasing IGA allows the city to make purchases using
the results of bids and RFPs from other governmental agencies. When it is in
the city's best interest, using a bid or RFP from another agency with which the
city has an IGA may be used. This allows the city to purchase like goods and
services without going through the bid process, which has already been done by
the agreeing agency. The vendor must agree to sell the goods at the same price.
The bid or RFP from the other agency must have been let within the last 12
months.
   B.   The City of Somerton is also a member of the Mojave Educational
Services Cooperative. Purchases made through this cooperative have also been
publicly bid and therefore are not subject to the bidding requirements.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE XI – MATERIALS MANAGEMENT
§ 3-5-205 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The Administrative Services Director shall develop and administer procedures

surplus materials as provided by statute. The disposition of surplus materials
shall be as follows.
      1.   Surplus materials shall be disposed of as provided by law. Only
certified funds or cash shall be accepted for sales of surplus property.
      2.   Auctions shall be advertised in accordance with statutory
provisions. When making sales by auction, the solicitation shall specify all
terms and conditions of any sale.
      3.   Materials to be disposed of by trade-in to a vendor for credit on an
acquisition shall be subject to the same approval levels set forth for contract
approvals as in Subarticle I, §
3-5-3. For credit amounts under $1,000, the department director may approve;
from $1,000 to $3,000 the purchasing agent may approve; and any credit amount
exceeding $30,000, the City Council must approve.
   B.   Without public auction, by unanimous approval of the City Council,
property may be sold or leased or donated to any other duly constituted
governmental entity including the state, cities, towns or other counties; or
city property may be sold, leased, or donated to any charitable, social, or
benevolent nonprofit organization in or operating in this state.
   C.   A city using agency may acquire federal or state surplus property as
may be usable and necessary for public purposes. These acquisitions can only be
made by authorized department directors.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
SUBARTICLE XII – PROCUREMENT ETHICS
§ 3-5-220 EMPLOYEE ETHICS.
   A.   It is the policy of the Purchasing Office to promote the city's
reputation for courtesy, fairness, impartiality, integrity, service,
progressivism, economy, and government by law. The responsibility for
implementing this policy rests with each individual who participates in the
procurement process, including the using department and suppliers, as well as
purchasing personnel. The Purchasing Office adheres to the ethical standards as
set forth in State of Arizona Procurement Code.
   B.   Among the prescribed practices for city employees are the following:
      1.   No public employee having official responsibility for a procurement
transaction shall represent the city in that transaction when the employee
knows that:
         a.   The employee is contemporaneously employed by a bidder, offeror,
or contractor involved in the procurement transaction;
         b.   The employee, the employee's partner, or any member of the
employee's immediate family holds a position with a bidder, offeror, or
contractor such as officer, director, trustee or partner, has a personal and
substantial participation in the transaction, or owns or controls more than 5%
of the firm;
         c.   The employee, the employee's partner or any member of the
employee's immediate family has a pecuniary interest arising from the
transaction;
         d.   The employee, the employee's partner or any member of the
employee's immediate family is negotiating, or has an arrangement concerning
prospective employment with a bidder, offeror, or contractor;
         e.   No employee having official responsibility for a procurement
transaction shall solicit, demand, accept or agree to accept any payment, loan
subscription, advance deposit of money, services, entertainment or anything of
more than nominal value from any bidder, offeror, contractor, or subcontractor.
      2.   Employees may attend functions that are not limited exclusively to
city employees, i.e., an industry trade fair, or like function. Purchases made
directly from any city employee must be reviewed by the Finance Director and a
written conflict of interest statement must be submitted to the City Clerk to
be entered into the public record.
      3.   Any person involved in a transaction may request a written City
Attorney's opinion about the applicability of these provisions.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-221 CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   A.   State Statute A.R.S. § 38-503 defines CONFLICT OF INTEREST, in part, as
follows:
Conflict of Interest........Any public officer or employee of a public agency
who has, or whose relative has, a substantial interest in any contract, sale,
purchase, or service to such public agency shall make known that interest in
the official records of the public agency and shall refrain from voting upon or
otherwise participating in any manner as an officer or employee in the
contract, sale, or purchase.
   B.   The mere employment of an individual simultaneously by the city and an
outside company that has a direct or indirect business relationship with the
city, in itself, establishes no conflict of interest.
   C.   A conflict of interest would arise if actions by the city employee
conferred a direct or indirect pecuniary or proprietary benefit on the city
employee or a relative by virtue of that person's connection with the outside
business. The law provides that when the potential for a conflict of interest
arises, the city employee must make his or her interest (or that of a relative)
known and refrain from taking any action or otherwise participating in any way
in the matter.
   D.   When a potential for conflict of interest arises, the city employee
must provide written notification to the City Clerk, identifying what
relationship exists that could be classified as a potential conflict. Should a
question arise pertaining to any potential conflict of interest in a purchasing
situation, consult with the Administrative Services Director or the City
Attorney's office.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-222 GRATUITIES.

or an offer of employment in connection with any decision, approval,
disapproval, recommendation, preparation of any part of a purchase request.
City employees shall not accept personal gifts from any past, current, or
potential supplier of goods or services to the city.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)

§ 3-5-225 VENDOR ETHICS.
   City of Somerton requires vendors to also be held to certain ethical
requirements as follows:
   A.   No bidder, offeror, contractor, or subcontractor shall confer upon any
public employee having official responsibility for a procurement transaction
any payment, loan, subscription, advance, deposit of money, services, or
anything of more than nominal value, present or promised;
   B.   All bidders, offerors, contractors, or subcontractors shall submit with

debarment, and suspension from bidding and recession of contracts;
   D.   No contractor or subcontractor shall give, demand, or receive from any
supplier, subcontractor, or competitors any bribe, kickback, or anything of
value in return for participation in a procurement transaction or agreeing not
to compete in a transaction; and
   E.   Architects or engineers employed by the city may not furnish building
materials, supplies or equipment for any structure or project on which they are
providing professional services. The city also does not accept bids or
proposals from consultants or bidders who have solely and directly prepared
specifications for a specific requirement, regardless of whether the
consultant/bidder was paid for the specification.
(Res. 2008-011, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 3-5-226 FRAUD.
   An act of fraud is committed if an employee of the city negotiates a
personal procurement by fraudulent use of a city requisition number or purchase
order number. Fraud also occurs if an employee claims a purchase is on behalf
of City of Somerton when in fact the purchase was made solely for personal use.
A personal procurement from the State Contracts is also an offense subject to
prosecution. Fraud is subject to prosecution and employee discipline.

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the WellsOne Commercial Card Program!
The purpose of the WellsOne Commercial Card Program is to streamline and
simplify the requisitioning, purchasing and payment process for small dollar
transactions. The program is designed to shorten the approval process and
reduce the paperwork of procurement procedures such as purchase orders, petty
cash, check requests and expense reimbursements. The goal of the program is to:
   - Reduce the cost of processing small dollar purchases
   - Receive faster delivery of required merchandise
   - Simplify the payment process
   - Provide cardholders with empowerment to choose!
This reference guide will provide you with the particulars of the program,
including general guidelines, reconcilement and record keeping procedures, and
customer service information. It is important to read the following information
carefully, as you will be responsible for adhering to the city-established
policy and procedures.
As with any new process, it is difficult to anticipate every question or issue
that may arise. The pilot phase is intended to surface procedures, issues or
hurdles that may be encountered in using the card. The feedback will give us an
opportunity to refine our policies and procedures.
If you have any additional questions, please contact your Department Head or
your card program administrators:

GENERAL GUIDELINES
Card Issuance:
As a cardholder, you will be asked to complete a cardholder application form,
which will then be signed, by your Department Head and the Program
Administrator. By signing the application form, you have agreed to adhere to
the guidelines established in this article. Most importantly, you are the only
person entitled to use the card and the card is not to be used for personal
use. As each card is linked to a specific cost center and individual employee,
the card cannot be transferred from one employee to another.
Upon receipt of your WellsOne Commercial Card, you will need to activate the
account by calling the toll-free number printed on the card. For verification
purposes, you will be asked to provide a piece of information, such as the last
four digits of your Social Security Number. Although the card will be issued in
your name, your personal credit history will not affect your ability to obtain
a card. The city is responsible for payment of all purchases.
Account Maintenance:
If there's a need to change any information regarding your account, such as
mailing address or expense accounting code, please complete the Account
Maintenance Form (see
Attachment II) and forward to your Program Administrator. The only account
information you are able to change online is the email address and the
automatic deposit (ACH) information.
Card Usage:
The WellsOne Commercial Card can be used at any merchant that accepts Visa,
except as the city otherwise directs. It may be used for in-store purchases as
well as online, phone, fax or mail orders. There is no special terminal or
equipment needed by the Visa merchant to process a card transaction.
When using the card with merchants, please emphasize that an invoice must not
be sent as this may result in a duplicate payment. For online, phone, fax and
mail orders, please instruct the merchant to send a receipt only. This receipt
must be retained for your records. When possible, print a copy of the receipt
from the on-line vendor.
Preferred Vendors vs. Vendors Not Accepting Visa:
Please refer to
Attachment III for a listing of our preferred vendors. Whenever possible,
please be sure to use these vendors.
Not all of your suppliers will accept Visa. However, as card programs become
more and more popular, vendors will want to accommodate their customers by
accepting Visa as a method of payment. If you have a vendor who does not accept
Visa, please contact your Program Administrator. Your Administrator will work
with Wells Fargo Bank to communicate our desire, and the benefits, of accepting
Visa. Alternatively, you may advise the vendor to contact its local bank for
details of becoming a Visa member. It will be to our benefit, and the success
of the program, if as many suppliers as possible are Visa merchants.
Limitations and Restrictions:
Your program administrator has assigned a credit limit to your card where every
cardholder has a total monthly dollar limit assigned to his or her account. As
limitations vary by cardholder, please discuss the limit with your respective
Department Head. If you believe your monthly limit to be insufficient for your
requirements, and your Department Head agrees, your Department Head must
contact the Program Administrator to have your limit(s) increased.
The WellsOne Commercial Card Program also allows for merchant category
blocking. If a particular merchant category is blocked (e.g., jewelry stores),
and you attempt to use your card at such a merchant, your purchase will be
declined. Management has made an effort to ensure that the vendors/suppliers
used during the normal course of business are not restricted. If your card is
refused at a merchant where you believe it should have been accepted, you
should call the Wells Fargo Business Purchasing Service Center at 1 -800-932-
0036 to determine the reason for refusal. Depending on the result of your
inquiry, you may want to discuss the issue further with your Program
Administrator. He or she (Administrator) is empowered to modify the
restrictions on your use of the card.
IMPORTANT: All requests for changes in limitations and restrictions must be
made through your Department Head or the Program Administrator. Wells Fargo
Bank will change existing cardholder restrictions only after a request is
received from the Program Administrator.
Lost or Stolen Cards:
You are responsible for the security of your card and any purchases made on
your account. If you believe you have lost your card or that it has been
stolen, immediately report this information to Wells Fargo Bank Business
Purchasing Service Center (BPSC) at 800-932-0036. Immediately after reporting
to the BPSC, you must inform your Program Administrator. It is extremely
important to act promptly in the event of a lost or stolen card to avoid city
liability for fraudulent transactions.
As with a personal charge card, you will no longer be able to use the account
number after notifying the bank. A new card should be issued within 48 hours of
notice to Wells Fargo Bank.
AUTHORIZED PURCHASES
Purchases may include:
•    Office supplies and forms
•    Books and subscriptions
•    Computer supplies, e.g., software and diskettes
•    Day timers and calendars
•    Professional membership dues
•    Hardware and tools
•    Spare parts
•    Miscellaneous items, e.g., videotapes
•    Congratulatory or sympathy flowers
•    Uniform rentals/cleaning
•    Courier/overnight deliveries
•    Mobile phones and pager bills
•    Travel and entertainment expenses
•    City vehicle expenses
Please refer to the attached preferred vendor listing. Whenever possible,
please purchase merchandise and/or materials from these vendors.
As with any city purchase, the card is not to be used for any product, service
or with any merchant considered to be inappropriate for city funds.
Failure to comply with the above guidelines for authorized purchases under the
WellsOne Commercial Card Program may result in disciplinary action,
cancellation of your card privileges, and possible termination of employment.
RECONCILEMENT AND PAYMENT
Reconcilement and Payment:
Unlike personal credit cards, the WellsOne Commercial Card Program is handled
as city liability. Your personal credit history has not been taken into account
when a card has been issued in your name.
The Accounts Payable Department is responsible for paying the Program invoice
(s) each month. You are not responsible for payment under your account.
At the end of a statement period, you will be notified via email that it is
time to review your card statement. You will access the Commercial Card Expense
Reporting tool via the Internet to review your statement. The statement will
reflect the transaction date, posting date, supplier/merchant name and the
total amount of the purchase. You have the ability to reconcile your account at
any time.
You are responsible for the following:
-   Retaining all receipts for items purchased under the program.
-   Ensuring all transactions posted are legitimate purchases made by yourself
on behalf of the city.
Receipt Retention/Record Log:
It is a requirement of the program that you keep all receipts for goods and
services purchased. For orders placed via phone, fax or mail, or online, you
must request a receipt, detailing merchandise price, sales/use tax, freight,
etc., be included with the goods mailed/shipped. (Note: a merchant should not
reject this request, as it is a Visa policy). It is extremely important to
request and retain purchase receipts, as this is the only original
documentation that shows whether sales tax has been paid.
To assist you in retaining receipts for purchases made over the phone, please
create a phone and internet purchase record log. Since standard reimbursement
policies require retention of receipts or other proof of purchase, record
keeping is not an extraordinary requirement.
As card records will be audited from time to time, it is essential to adhere to
the above record keeping guidelines.
Reconcilement of Purchases:
It is your responsibility, immediately upon receipt of your statement to check
it to ensure all the transactions posted are legitimate transactions made by
yourself, mark transactions for which receipts will be attached, and attach
line item detailed point of sale receipts or delivery invoices. Other optional
functions such as splitting transactions, adding descriptions, marking
transactions as personal, and reclassifying expenses can be performed using the
Commercial Card Expense Reporting tool. All of the available functions will be
part of your initial training and can be referenced in the Cardholder Quick
Reference Guide. If everything is in order, you will mark the statement as
reviewed. Once your statement has been marked as reviewed, an email will be
issued to your Department Head for his or her approval. Follow city procedures
for forwarding the receipts to your Department Head. Please make copies for
your records.
Disputed or Fraudulent Charges:
If there is a discrepancy between your record log and your statement, it is
imperative that the issue is addressed immediately! Depending on the type of
discrepancy, you will need to contact the merchant or complete the online
dispute form to resolve the disputed transaction.
If you believe the merchant has charged you incorrectly or there is an
outstanding quality or service issue, you must first contact the merchant and
try to resolve the error or problem. If you are able to resolve the matter
directly with the merchant, and the error involved an overcharge, a credit
adjustment should be requested and will appear on your next statement. Note:
The item should be highlighted on your record log as a reminder to verify that
correct credit has been received.
If the merchant disagrees that an adjustment is necessary, you will complete
the online dispute form. The details of the disputed transaction will be
entered online and followed up on by Wells Fargo Bank.
Wells Fargo Bank must receive any charge dispute within 60 days of the
transaction date. While pending resolution, Wells Fargo Bank will credit the
city's account for the amount of the disputed transaction. Although Wells Fargo
Bank acts as the arbitrator in any dispute, you should never assume that a
dispute will be resolved in your favor.
If the dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction, and you believe the
merchant has unfairly treated you, please notify your Department Head with the
relevant details. If the merchant is one of our preferred vendors, our
purchasing department may take further action.
Any fraudulent charge (i.e., a charge appearing which was not authorized by
you) must be reported immediately to your Program Administrator. Prompt
reporting of any such charge will help to prevent the city from being held
responsible.
SALES AND USE TAX
Merchants are required by tax authorities to include the applicable sales or
use tax at the time of purchase. The amount of tax is dependent on a variety of
factors including the state, country, and city where the goods are purchased.
All merchandise not purchased for resale should include the applicable sales
tax.
Out-of-state purchases, where sales tax has not been charged, should accrue the
applicable use tax.
If your purchases are usually tax-exempt, you will be required to provide
merchants with the necessary forms for non-taxable goods or services. Your
program may require that you have two cards, one for tax-exempt and one for
taxable items. Questions regarding this policy and any other questions
concerning tax issues should be addressed to your Program Administrator.
COMMON QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS
•    Why did the city decide to participate in a Commercial Card Program?
Like most companies today, we are exploring ways to streamline processes and
reduce costs. Frequently the expenses incurred to process a small dollar
purchase can run as high as the price of the item itself.
With a commercial card, many of the typical purchasing steps should be
eliminated including generating a requisition, preparing a purchase order,
matching a packing slip to a purchase order, matching invoices with purchasing
requisitions, individual payments of invoices, and the like.
•    What is the procedure when I pay for something with my commercial card?
Essentially, the process is the same as when using your personal credit card.
You must always ask for a receipt for your records, particularly for online,
phone, fax and mail orders.
•    Are there any restrictions associated with the use of my card?
Yes, in addition to our city policy stating the type of products you can buy
and our preferred vendor list, other controls and limits may be placed on your
card including:
•    Monthly dollar limit
•    Daily dollar limit
•    Per transaction dollar limit
•    "Blocked" merchant categories
Please see your Department Head or Program Administrator for your specific
restrictions.
•    How will I know if I have exceeded my monthly limit?
You can check you balance and expenditures online at any time. You may also
call the toll-free Wells Fargo Bank Customer Service number on the back of your
card.
•    What should I do if a supplier does not accept the WellsOne Commercial
Card?
Please contact your Program Administrator and provide him or her with the
supplier's name, address and phone number.
•    How will I know if the city is getting billed correctly for the purchases
I have made?
You will be able to check all transactions online at any time. You will also
review your statements at the end of each period. This statement is for your
review only and allows you to reconcile your purchases. You must review the
statement in a timely manner, as any disputed or fraudulent transactions must
be reported to Wells Fargo Bank in a timely manner.
•    How will my monthly commercial card bills be paid?
You are not responsible for the payment of your commercial card bills. The
monthly statement you receive is for your review and reconcilement only.
Accounts Payable will make one monthly payment to Wells Fargo Bank covering
expenses for all city employees using the card.
•    Who in our city may I talk to if I have questions going forward?
We have designated the following individual(s) as Program Administrators) (PA).
Administrative Services Director, the PA should be contracted for any questions
you have regarding limits, usage and other issues.
Only the PA has the authority to change any existing information or
restrictions to a cardholder's account.
•    What should I do if I have a problem associated with something I bought
with my WellsOne Commercial Card?
Please refer to the "Disputed or Fraudulent Charges" section of this guide for
complete details. It is extremely important that you address these items
immediately.
•    Once I receive the card, can I begin using it immediately?
Once you receive your card, you will be instructed to call Wells Fargo Bank's
toll-free number and provide certain information (e.g., Social Security Number
or other meaningful data) to activate the card. This procedure ensures a secure
card issuance process and helps to prevent fraud.
•    What should I do if my card is lost or stolen?
It is extremely important to call Wells Fargo Bank's Customer Service toll-free
number (1-800-932-0036) immediately in the event your card is lost or stolen.
You must also notify your Program Administrator.
•    Can another employee utilize my card for purchases?
Each WellsOne Commercial Card will be embossed with the individual employee's
name. The employee is responsible for the proper use of his or her card. At no
time should another individual utilize your card.
•    Can the WellsOne Commercial Card be used throughout the United States?
Yes, the WellsOne Commercial Card is accepted worldwide. Purchases can be made
in any currency and billed in U.S. Dollars.
•    What should I do if I need to change my monthly or single purchase limits?
You may request a credit limit change online under the Personal Profile tab or
contact your Program Administrator.

my use privileges or other corrective action, up to and including termination.
3.    I understand that under no circumstances will I use the Purchasing Card
to make personal purchases, either for myself or for others. Using the card for

4.    I agree that should I violate the terms of this Agreement and use the
Purchasing Card for personal use, the City of Somerton shall have the right to
deduct any amounts owed, including but not limited to charges incurred from
collection agencies, internal administration costs, court costs, etc, from my

discrepancies by either contacting the merchant or Wells Fargo Bank myself.

employment, whether for retirement, voluntary, or involuntary reasons.

and procedures and this Cardholder agreement. When signed and accepted, this
form acts to assign the formal delegation of purchase authority to a current

Compliance with Policy, Violations and Consequences:
Employee violations to this agreement or to any policy regarding the purchase
of goods or services will be investigated and may result in either one or more
of the following actions: written warning, revocation of credit card

termination as a city employee. Human error and extraordinary circumstances may
be taken into consideration when investigating any violation to this agreement.
The Administrative Services Director has the authority to investigate and to
determine whether a violation of procurement policy has occurred, and to
recommend actions that may be taken because of such determinations. The City of

returns or adjustments to ensure proper credit is given on subsequent
statements.
Protecting the Credit Card:
The credit card is valuable property which requires proper treatment by the
Cardholder to protect it from misuse by unauthorized parties.
Validation and Safekeeping:
Sign the credit card immediately upon receipt. The credit card should always be
treated with the same care as personal credit cards, bankcards, cash and
checks. Keep your card(s) in an accessible, but secure location. When using the
credit card for internet purchases, cardholders should ensure that the site
utilizes industry recognized encryption transmission tools.

card, cut the old credit card in half and dispose of it. Make sure the credit
card is returned to you after each charge and verify that the returned credit
card has your name on it.

number immediately and the Administrative Services Director.

      (3)   No development impact fees shall be charged, or credits issued, for
any capital facility that does not fall within one of the categories of
necessary public services for which development impact fees may be assessed as
identified in §
7-3-8(A)(1).
      (4)   Costs for necessary public services made necessary by new
development shall be based on the same level of service provided to existing
development in the same service area. Development impact fees may not be used
to provide a higher level of service to existing development or to meet
stricter safety, efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory standards to
the extent that these are applied to existing capital facilities that are
serving existing development.
      (5)   Development impact fees may not be used to pay the city's
administrative, maintenance, or other operating costs.
      (6)   Projected interest charges and financing costs can only be included
in development impact fees to the extent they represent principal and/or
interest on the portion of any financing or debt used to finance the
construction or expansion of a capital facility identified in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (7)    Except for any fees included on interim fee schedules, all
development impact fees charged by the city must be included in a fee schedule
prepared pursuant to this chapter and included in the fee report; example
versions of all fee schedules are provided in Appendix A.
      (8)   All development impact fees shall meet the requirements of A.R.S. §
9-463.05.
   (B)   Costs per EDU. The fee report shall summarize the costs of capital
facilities necessary to serve new development on a per EDU basis as defined and
calculated in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, including all required
offsets, and shall recommend a development impact fee structure for adoption by
the city. The actual impact fees to be assessed shall be disclosed and adopted
in the form of impact fee schedules.
   (C)   Carry-over of previously-established development impact fees and
grandfathered facilities. Notwithstanding the requirements of this chapter,
certain development impact fees adopted by the city prior to the effective date
of this chapter shall continue in effect as follows:
      (1)   Until August 1, 2014, or the date a new development impact fee is
effective for the applicable category of necessary public services in a service
area pursuant to this chapter, whichever occurs first, development impact fees
established prior to January 1, 2012, shall continue in full force and effect
to the extent that the development impact fee is used to provide a category of
necessary public services that is authorized by §
7-3-8. Development impact fees collected prior to January 1, 2012, shall be
expended on capital facilities within the same category of necessary public
services for which they were collected.
      (2)   The city may continue to collect and use any development impact fee
established before January 1, 2012, even if the development impact fee would
not otherwise be permitted to be collected and spent pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-
463.05, as amended by the state legislature in SB 1525, Fiftieth Legislature,
First Regular Session, if either of the following apply:
         (a)   Both of the following conditions are met:
            1.   Prior to June 1, 2011, the development impact fee was pledged
towards the repayment of financing or debt incurred by the city to provide a
capital facility.
            2.   The applicable capital facility was included in the city's
Infrastructure Improvements Plan, or other city planning document prepared
pursuant to applicable law, prior to June 1, 2011.
         (b)   Before August 1, 2014, the city uses the development impact fee
to finance a capital facility in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05, Subsection
(S).
      (3)   Defined terms in any previously established fee schedule shall be
interpreted according to the ordinance in effect at the time of their adoption.
(Ord. 2014-004, passed 6-17-2014)
§ 7-3-6 ADMINISTRATION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Separate accounts. Development impact fees collected pursuant to this
chapter shall be placed in separate, interest-bearing accounts for each capital
facility category within each service area.
   (B)   Limitations on use of fees. Development impact fees and any interest
thereon collected pursuant to this chapter shall be spent to provide capital
facilities associated with the same category of necessary public services in
the same service area for which they were collected, including costs of
financing or debt used by the city to finance such capital facilities and other
costs authorized by this chapter that are included in the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan.
   (C)   Time limit. Development impact fees collected after July 31, 2014,
shall be used within ten years of the date upon which they were collected for
all categories of necessary public services except for water and wastewater
facilities. For water facilities or wastewater facilities collected after July
31, 2014, development impact fees must be used within 15 years of the date upon
which they were collected.
(Ord. 2014-004, passed 6-17-2014)
§ 7-3-7 LAND USE ASSUMPTIONS.
   The Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall be consistent with the city's
current land use assumptions for each service area and each category of
necessary public services as adopted by the city pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
   (A)   Reviewing the land use assumptions. Prior to the adoption or amendment
of an Infrastructure Improvements Plan, the city shall review and evaluate the
land use assumptions on which the Infrastructure Improvements Plan is to be
based to ensure that the land use assumptions within each service area conform
with the general plan.
   (B)   Evaluating necessary changes. If the land use assumptions upon which
an Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based have not been updated within the
last five years, the city shall evaluate the land use assumptions to determine
whether changes are necessary. If, after general evaluation, the city
determines that the land use assumptions are still valid, the city shall issue
the report required in §
7-3-10.
   (C)   Required modifications to land use assumptions. If the city determines
that changes to the land use assumptions are necessary in order to adopt or
amend an Infrastructure Improvements Plan, it shall make such changes as
necessary to the land use assumptions prior to or in conjunction with the
review and approval of the Infrastructure Improvements Plan pursuant to §
7-3-10.
(Ord. 2014-004, passed 6-17-2014)
§ 7-3-8 INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Infrastructure Improvements Plan contents. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall be developed by qualified professionals and may be
based upon or incorporated within the city's Capital Improvements Plan. The
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall:
      (1)   Specify the categories of necessary public services for which the
city will impose a development impact fee, which may include any or all of the
following:
         (a)   Water;
         (b)   Wastewater;
         (c)   Stormwater, drainage, and flood control;
         (d)   Libraries;
         (e)   Street facilities;
         (f)   Fire protection;
         (g)   Police; or
         (h)   Parks.
      (2)   Define and provide a map of one or more service areas within which
the city will provide each category of necessary public services for which
development impact fees will be charged. Each service area must be defined in a
manner that demonstrates a substantial nexus between the capital facilities to
be provided in the service area and the EDUs to be served by those capital
facilities. For libraries and for parks larger than 30 acres, each service area
must be defined in a manner that demonstrates a direct benefit between the
capital facilities and the EDUs to be served by those capital facilities. The
city may cover more than one category of capital facilities in the same service
area provided that there is an independent substantial nexus or direct benefit,
as applicable, between each category of necessary public services and the EDUs
to be served.
      (3)   Identify and describe the land use assumptions upon which the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based in each service area.
      (4)   Analyze and identify the existing level of service provided by the
city to existing EDUs for each category of necessary public services in each
service area.
      (5)   Identify the level of service to be provided by the city for each
category of necessary public services in each service area based on the
relevant land use assumptions and any established city standards or policies
related to required levels of service. If the city provides the same category
of necessary public services in more than one service area, the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall include a comparison of the levels of service to be
provided in each service area.
      (6)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the existing capacity of the capital facilities in each service area,
the utilization of those capital facilities by existing EDUs, and the available
excess capacity of those capital facilities to serve new EDUs including any
existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage of such capacity.
The Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall additionally identify any changes or
upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned level of service to existing EDUs, or to meet new safety,
efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory requirements for services
provided to existing EDUs.
      (7)   Identify any grandfathered facilities and the impact thereof on the
need for necessary public services in each affected service area.
      (8)   Estimate the total number of existing and future EDUs within each
service area based on the city's land use assumptions and projected new EDUs in
each service area.
      (9)   Based on the analysis in divisions (3) through (6) above, provide a
summary table or tables describing the level of service for each category of
necessary public services by relating the required capital facilities to EDUs
in each service area, and identifying the applicable EDU factor associated with
each category of development.
      (10)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing
capital facilities, and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be
required to provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service
area as a result of the new projected EDUs in that service area, for a period
not to exceed ten years. Nothing in this division shall prohibit the city from
additionally including in its Infrastructure Improvements Plan projected
utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer than ten
years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded from the
calculation of the plan-based cost per EDU.
      (11)   For each category of necessary public services, estimate the total
cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital facilities
that will be required to serve new EDUs, including costs of land acquisition,
improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to
design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs, as well as
projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include costs for
ongoing operation and maintenance of capital facilities, nor for replacement of
capital facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve
existing EDUs. If the Infrastructure Improvements Plan includes changes or
upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned level of service to existing EDUs or to meet new
regulatory requirements for services provided to existing EDUs, such costs
shall be identified and distinguished in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (12)   Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other
sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities
identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, which shall include
estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad
valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and
the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based
on the approved land use assumptions. The Infrastructure Improvements Plan
shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct and
implement the new or expanded capital facilities.
      (13)   Calculate required offsets as follows:
         (a)   From the forecasted revenues in division (12) above, identify
those sources of revenue that are attributable to new development and will
contribute to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services.
         (b)   For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to
division (a) above, calculate the relative contribution of each category of
development to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services in
each service area.
         (c)   Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to
division (b) above, for each category of necessary public services, calculate
the total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service
area.
         (d)   For each category of necessary public services, convert the
total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service
area into an offset amount per EDU by dividing the total offset for each
category of development by the number of EDUs associated with that category of
development.
         (e)   Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the
required offset, if the city imposes a construction, contracting, or similar
excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege
tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax
classifications in the city, the entire excess portion of the construction,
contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the
capital costs of necessary public services provided to new development unless
the excess portion is already utilized for such purpose pursuant to this
section.
         (f)   In determining the amount of required offset for land included
in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter
4, Article 6, the city shall take into account any capital facilities provided
by the district that are included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
the capital costs paid by the district for such capital facilities, and shall
offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district
proportionally.
      (14)   Calculate the plan-based cost per EDU by:
         (a)   Dividing the total projected costs to provide capital facilities
to new EDUs for each category of necessary public services in each service area
as determined pursuant to division (9) above into the number of new EDUs
projected for that service area over a period not to exceed ten years,
considering the specific EDU factor(s) associated with such EDUs for each
category of necessary public services.
         (b)   Subtracting the required offset per EDU calculated pursuant to
division (11) above.
   (B)   Multiple plans. An Infrastructure Improvements Plan adopted pursuant
to this division may address one or more of the city's categories of necessary
public services in any or all of the city's service areas. Each capital
facility shall be subject to no more than one Infrastructure Improvements Plan
at any given time.
   (C)   Reserved capacity. The city may reserve capacity in an Infrastructure
Improvements Plan to serve one or more planned future developments, including
capacity reserved through a development agreement pursuant to §
7-3-13. All reservations of existing capacity must be disclosed in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan at the time it is adopted.
(Ord. 2014-004, passed 6-17-2014)
§ 7-3-9 ADOPTION AND MODIFICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Adopting or amending the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. The
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall be adopted or amended subject to the
following procedures:
      (1)   Major amendments to the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. Except as
provided in division (A)(2) below, the adoption or amendment of an
Infrastructure Improvement Plan shall occur at one or more public hearings
according to the following schedule, and may occur concurrently with the
adoption of an update of the city's land use assumptions as provided in §
7-3-7:
         (a)   Sixty days before the first public hearing regarding a new or
updated Infrastructure Improvements Plan, the city shall provide public notice
of the hearing and post the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and the underlying
land use assumptions on its website. The city shall additionally make available
to the public the documents used to prepare the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and underlying land use assumptions and the amount of any proposed changes
to the plan-based cost per EDU.
         (b)   The city shall conduct a public hearing on the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and underlying land use assumptions at least 30 days, but no
more than 60 days, before approving or disapproving the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan.
      (2)   Minor amendments to the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, the city may update the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan and/or its underlying land use assumptions
without a public hearing if all of the following apply:
         (a)   The changes in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and/or the
underlying land use assumptions will not add any new category of necessary
public services to any service area.
         (b)   The changes in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and/or the
underlying land use assumptions will not increase the level of service to be
provided in any service area.
         (c)   Based on an analysis of the fee report and the city's adopted
development impact fee schedules, the changes in the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions would not,
individually or cumulatively with other amendments undertaken pursuant to this
division, have caused a development impact fee in any service area to have been
increased by more than 5% above the development impact fee that is provided in
the current development impact fee schedule.
         (d)   At least 30 days prior to the date that the any amendment
pursuant to this section is adopted, the city shall post the proposed
amendments on the city website.
   (B)   Amendments to the fee report. Any adoption or amendment of a fee
report and fee schedule shall occur at one or more public hearings according to
the following schedule:
      (1)   The first public hearing on the fee report must be held at least 30
days after the adoption or approval of and Infrastructure Improvements Plan as
provided in division (A) above. The city must give at least 30 days notice
prior to the hearing, provided that this notice may be given on the same day as
the approval or disapproval of the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (2)   The city shall make the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
underlying land use assumptions available to the public on the city's website
30 days prior to the public hearing described in division (B)(1) above.
      (3)   The fee report may be adopted by the city no sooner than 30 days,
and no later than 60 days, after the hearing described in division (B)(1)
above.
      (4)   The development fee schedules in the fee report adopted pursuant to
this division shall become effective 75 days after adoption of the fee report
by the city.
(Ord. 2014-004, passed 6-17-2014)
§ 7-3-10 FIVE-YEAR VALIDITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS PLAN AND THE
LAND USE ASSUMPTIONS.
   (A)   Renewing the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. Except as provided in
division (B) below, not later than every five years the city shall update the
applicable Infrastructure Improvements Plan and fee report related to each
category of necessary public services pursuant to §
7-3-9. Such five-year period shall be calculated from the date of the adoption
of the Infrastructure Improvements Plan or the date of the adoption of the fee
report, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   Determination of no changes. Notwithstanding division (A) above, if
the city determines that no changes to an Infrastructure Improvements Plan,
underlying land use assumptions, or fee report are needed, the city may elect
to continue the existing Infrastructure Improvements Plan and fee report
without amendment by providing notice as follows:
      (1)   Notice of the determination shall be published at least 180 days
prior to the end of the five-year period described in division (A) of this

days to any timely requests submitted pursuant to division (B)(4) of this
section.
(Ord. 2014-004, passed 6-17-2014)
§ 7-3-11 COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Collection. Development impact fees, together with administrative
charges assessed pursuant to division (A)(6) of this section, shall be
calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence
development, specifically:
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement
adopted pursuant to §
7-3-13, development impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building
permit according to the current development impact fee schedule for the
applicable service area(s) as adopted pursuant to this chapter, or according to
any other development impact fee schedule as authorized in this chapter.
      (2)   If a building permit is not required for the development, but water
or wastewater connections are required, any and all development impact fees due
shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased. If only a
wastewater connection is required, the development impact fees shall be paid
prior to approval of a connection to the sewer system. Wastewater development
impact fees shall be assessed if a development connects to the public sewer, or
as determined by the Public Works Director, is capable of discharging sewage to
a city public sewer.
      (3)   If the development is located in a service area with a stormwater,
drainage, and flood control development impact fee, and neither a building
permit, water, or sewer service connection is required, the storm drainage
development impact fee due shall be paid at the time a civil or site permit is
issued for the development.
      (4)   No building permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of
occupancy shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed
in the previous paragraphs.
      (5)   If the building permit is for a change in the type of building use,
an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a
residential or nonresidential point of demand to the water or wastewater
system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service
units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development
impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type.
      (6)   For issued permits that expire or are voided, development impact
fees and administrative charges shall be as follows:
         (a)   If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or
voided permit, and the development impact fees paid for such development have
not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any
development impact fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the
fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed.
         (b)   If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being
sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit applicant
shall pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in
effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original
permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit
applicant, the new permit applicant shall pay development impact fees as if it
were the original permittee.
   (B)   Exceptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either of
the following conditions:
      (1)   Development impact fees have been paid for the development and the
permit(s) which triggered the collection of the development impact fees have
not expired or been voided.
      (2)   The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development impact
fees involve modifications to existing residential or non-residential
development that do not add new EDUs, increase the impact of existing EDUs on
existing or future capital facilities, or change the land-use type of the
existing development to a different category of development for which a higher
development impact fee would have been due. To the extent that any modification
does not meet the requirements of this division, the development impact fee due
shall be the difference between the development impact fee that was or would
have been due on the existing development and the development impact fee that
is due on the development as modified.
   (C)   Temporary exemptions from development impact fee schedules. New
developments in the city shall be temporarily exempt from increases in
development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or modified
development impact fee schedules as follows:
      (1)   Residential uses. On or after the day that the first building
permit is issued for a single-family residential development, the city shall,
at the permittee's request, provide the permittee with an applicable
development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24
months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which
shall expire at the end of the first business day of the twenty-fifth month
thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development impact
fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same single-family residential
development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee
schedule.
      (2)   Commercial, industrial and multi-family uses. On or after the day
that the final approval, as defined in A.R.S. § 9-463.05(T)(4), is issued for a
commercial, industrial or multi-family development, the city shall provide an
applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period
of 24 months beginning on the day that final development approval of a site
plan or final subdivision plat is given, and which shall expire at the end of
the first business day of the twenty-fifth month thereafter. During the
effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule, any
building permit issued for the same development shall not be subject to any new
or modified development impact fee schedule.
      (3)   Other development. Any category of development not covered under
divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above shall pay development impact fees according
to the fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as specified in
division (A).
      (4)   Changes to site plans and subdivision plats. Notwithstanding the
other requirements of this division, if changes are made to a development's
final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service
units after the issuance of a grandfathered development impact fee schedule,
the city may assess any new or modified development impact fees against the
additional service units. If the city reduces the amount of an applicable
development impact fee during the period that a grandfathered development
impact fee schedule is in force, the city shall assess the lower development
impact fee.
   (D)   Option to pursue special fee determination. Where a development is of
a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development
appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development
has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated
with providing necessary public services to that development will differ
substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified
category of development, the city may require the applicant to provide the City
Community Development Director or authorized designee with an alternative
development impact fee analysis. Based on a projection of the actual burdens
and costs that will be associated with the development, the alternative
development impact fee analysis may propose a unique fee for the development
based on the application of an appropriate EDU factor to the applicable plan-
based cost per EDU, or may propose that the development be covered under the
development impact fee schedule governing a different and more analogous
category of development. The City Community Development Director or authorized
designee shall review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall make a
determination as to the development impact fee to be charged. Such decision
shall be appealable pursuant to §
7-3-14. The City Community Development Director or authorized designee may
require the applicant to pay an administrative fee to cover the actual costs of
reviewing the special fee determination application.
(Ord. 2014-004, passed 6-17-2014)
§ 7-3-12 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE CREDITS AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Eligibility of capital facility. All development impact fee credits
must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   One of the following is true:
         (a)   The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward a
capital facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit
will be issued, must be identified in an adopted infrastructure improvements
plan and fee report as a capital facility for which a development impact fee
was assessed; or
         (b)   The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city
that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility
should have been included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan in lieu of a
different capital facility that was included in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject
capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the
city shall amend the Infrastructure Improvements Plan to include the subject
replacement facility and delete the capital facility that will be replaced.
      (2)   Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a
developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by
the city through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the
developer will be paid or reimbursed by the city for any contribution, payment,
construction, or dedication from any city funding source including an agreement
to reimburse the developer with future collected development impact fees
pursuant to §
7-3-13, any credits claimed by the developer shall be deducted from any amounts
to be paid or reimbursed by the city or reduced by the amount of such payment
or reimbursement.
   (B)   Eligibility of subject development. To be eligible for a credit, the
subject development must be located within the service area of the eligible
capital facility.
   (C)   Calculation of credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the
costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted Infrastructure
Improvements Plan for which a development fee was assessed pursuant to the fee
report. If the gross impact fee for a particular category of necessary public
service is adopted at an amount lower than the plan-based cost per EDU, the
amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to the difference between
the plan-based cost per EDU and the gross impact fee adopted. A credit shall
not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in providing the eligible
capital facility.
   (D)   Allocation of credits. Before any credit can be issued to a subject
development (or portion thereof), the credit must be allocated to that
development as follows:
      (1)   The developer and the city must execute a credit agreement
including all of the following:
         (a)   The total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an
eligible capital facility.
         (b)   The estimated number of EDUs to be served within the subject
development.
         (c)   The method by which the credit values will be distributed within
the subject development.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of
development impact fee credits through an application for a credit agreement
(which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to §
7-3-13).
      (3)   If a building permit is issued or a water/sewer connection is
purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a credit
agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated
retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any
remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this chapter.
      (4)   If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or
relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior
to execution of a credit agreement or development agreement, credits resulting

§ 7-3-13 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   Development agreements containing provisions regarding development impact
fees, development impact fee credits, and/or disbursement of revenues from
development impact fee accounts shall comply with the following:
   (A)   Development agreement required. A development agreement is required to
authorize any of the following:
      (1)   To issue credits prior to the city's acceptance of an eligible
capital facility.
      (2)   To allocate credits to a parcel that is not contiguous with the
subject development and that does not meet the requirements of division (D)(7)
of §
7-3-12.
      (3)   To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using
funds from development impact fee accounts.
      (4)   To allocate different credit amounts per EDU to different parcels
within a subject development.
      (5)   For a single family residential dwelling unit, to allow development
impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit
as provided in this section.
   (B)   General requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared and
executed in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and any applicable requirements
of the city code. Except where specifically modified by this section, all
provisions of §
7-3-12 shall apply to any credit agreement that is authorized as part of a
development agreement.
   (C)   Early credit issuance. A development agreement may authorize the
issuance of credits prior to acceptance of an eligible capital facility by the
city when the development agreement specifically states the form and value of
the security (i.e. bond, letter of credit, and the like) to be provided to the
city/town prior to issuance of any credits. The city shall determine the
acceptable form and value of the security to be provided.
   (D)   Non-contiguous credit allocation. A development agreement may

the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that
served by the eligible capital facility.
      (2)   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from

credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a mechanism
for future determination of the credit values.
   (E)   Uneven credit allocation. The development agreement must specify how
credits will be allocated amongst different parcels on a per-EDU basis, if the
credits are not to be allocated evenly. If the development agreement is silent
on this topic, all credits will be allocated evenly amongst all parcels on a
per-EDU basis.
   (F)   Use of reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from impact fee
accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be utilized in
accordance with applicable law for the use of city funds in construction or
acquisition of capital facilities, including A.R.S. § 34-201 et seq.
   (G)   Deferral of fees. A development agreement may provide for the deferral
of payment of development impact fees for a residential development beyond the
issuance of a building permit, provided that a development impact fee may not
be paid later than the 15 days after the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy for that dwelling unit. The development agreement shall provide for
the value of any deferred development impact fees to be supported by
appropriate security, including a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash bond.
   (H)   Waiver of fees. If the city agrees to waive any development impact
fees assessed on development in a development agreement, the city shall
reimburse the appropriate development impact fee account for the amount that
was waived
   (I)   No obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the city to enter
into any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit agreement
permitted by this section.

§ 7-3-15 REFUNDS OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current
owner of property within the city who submits a written request to the city and
demonstrates that:
      (1)   The permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development
impact fee have expired or been voided prior to the commencement of the
development for which the permits were issued and the development impact fees
collected have not been expended, encumbered, or pledged for the repayment of
financing or debt; or
      (2)   The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in
interest paid a development impact fee for the applicable capital facility on
or after August 1, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists:
         (a)   The capital facility designed to serve the subject real property
has been constructed, has the capacity to serve the subject real property and
any development for which there is reserved capacity, and the service which was
to be provided by that capital facility has not been provided to the subject
real property from that capital facility or from any other infrastructure.
         (b)   After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility, the
city fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time
period identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, as it may be
amended, and the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject
real property from that capital facility or any other infrastructure.

facilities is not spent within 15 years of the city's receipt of the
development impact fee.
         (e)   The development impact fee was calculated and collected for the
construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital facility
serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the
capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan by a factor of 10% or more. In such event, the
current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request as set forth in
this division (A), be entitled to a refund for the difference between the
amounts of the development impact fee charged for and attributable to such
construction cost and the amount the development impact fee would have been
calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the fee
report. The refund contemplated by this division shall relate only to the costs
specific to the construction of the applicable capital facility and shall not
include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly
incurred for construction of the capital facility that are included in the
development impact fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
   (B)   Earned interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include
any interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development impact
fee by the city from the date of collection to the date of refund. All refunds
shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is
paid.

governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity.

special fee will be assessed on "on-property collection," where the containers
are more than 200 feet from the property entrance.
      4.   Collection equipment and employees shall at all times have

collection service for refuse which the Public Works Director determines to be
hazardous and to require the customer to properly dispose of it by other means.

similar places regardless of size will not be collected by the city.
   E.   Byproducts. Any commercial or manufacturing establishment (including
fruit and vegetable packing houses or manufacturing or processing plants) which
by the nature of its operations create an unusual amount of byproduct refuse,
may be required by the city to dispose of its own waste as opposed to having
the city provide the service. This would generally be handled by mutual
agreement between the city and establishment at time of startup operations.

structures shall, upon the completion of any such structure, remove, at their
sole cost and expense, all refuse of every nature, description, or kind which

shall record a release of the notice.
(Ord. 2009- , passed - -2009)
§ 9-4-6 REMOVAL BY CITY.
   When any such person to whom notice, as aforesaid, has been given, and on or

§ 9-7-1 PURPOSE AND FINDING OF FACTS.
   A.   The purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect
property, and prevent damage to the environment from the polluted stormwater
runoff from construction sites that disturb one acre or more of land in the
City of Somerton. This article will also promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating and controlling the design, construction, and use of any development
or other activity that disturbs one acre or more within the city's
jurisdiction.
   B.   During construction activities, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by
wind and water. This soil poses a serious threat to endangered species and
limited water resources, by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of
aquatic habitat for fish, aquatic life, and native riparian vegetation. Eroded
soil also results in the accelerated need to clean storm drains, clear and
clean ditches, and dredge lakes and river backwaters. In addition, clearing and
grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat for retarding and reducing stormwater runoff.

corporation, association, partnership, or any public agency or instrumentality
without the expressed permission of the owner, manager, tenant, or other person
responsible for the property.
      2.   No person shall possess graffiti instruments in such a manner as to
give rise to an inference of intent to make graffiti; and, no person shall
possess an aerosol paint container in any public place, including any building,
park, facility or alley or on any private property where that person has no
right to be, unless possession is authorized or required as part of a
legitimate business or activity.
   C.   Limiting access to graffiti implements.
      1.   No person who owns, conducts, operates, or manages a business where
aerosol spray paint containers are sold, nor any person who sells or offers for
sale aerosol spray paint containers shall store or display, or cause to be
stored or displayed, the aerosol spray paint containers in an area that is
accessible to the public without employee assistance in the regular course of
business pending legal sale or other disposition.
      2.   Nothing herein shall preclude the storage or display of aerosol
spray paint containers in an area viewable by the public so long as the items
are not accessible to the public without employee assistance.
      3.   No person who owns, conducts, operates or manages a business where
aerosol spray paint containers are sold, nor any person who sells or offers for
sell aerosol spray paint containers shall sell or offer to sell aerosol spray
paint containers to any person under the age of 18 years of age. A sign shall

   D.   Penalty. Any person who violates any provision of this article upon
first conviction shall be considered guilty of a petty offense and upon
subsequent convictions shall be guilty of a class one misdemeanor punishable as
set forth in this code and state law.
   E.   Removal of graffiti by the city. The city having determined that
graffiti constitutes both vandalism and filth and debris does hereby compel the
owner, lessee or occupant of buildings, grounds or lots to remove graffiti on
basis that its presence constitutes a hazard to public health and safety. The
removal of the graffiti shall be accomplished according to the following
provisions.
      1.   Upon determining that graffiti has been applied to any building or
structure, whether public or private, within the city limits, the city shall
cause a written notice to be sent to the owner, occupant or lessee. The written
notice shall give five days for compliance by removal of the graffiti from the
building or structure.
      2.   Notice shall be by either personal service or certified or
registered mail, and if the owner does not occupy the building or premises,
then the notice shall be provided to the owner as indicated on the Yuma County
tax rolls.
      3.   If after five days from actual notice the owner or occupant or
lessee has failed to remove the graffiti, the city may cause the graffiti to be
removed and assess the costs of removal against the owner of the real property
upon which the building or structure is located.
      4.   Notice of intent to go upon private property and to remove or abate
the graffiti shall be given in the same manner as notice set forth in division
A. of this section. The notice of intent to go upon private property and remove
graffiti shall also include the city's estimate as to the cost for the removal
or abatement of the graffiti and that the actual amount of the cost shall be
certified by the city and recorded in the office of the County Recorder as a
lien against the real property. Any owner, occupant or lessee who receives
written notice to remove or abate the graffiti or written notice that the city
intends to enter upon private property to remove or abate the graffiti may
appeal to the City Council for a hearing on either the notice or the amount of
the assessment. The appeal must be in writing and act as a stay of all
proceedings until such time as the Council schedules a time, place and date
certain for the hearing.
      5.   A prior assessment or lien for the purpose provided in this section
shall not be a bar to a subsequent assessment or assessments for that purpose
and any number of liens on the same lot or tract of land may be enforced in the
same option.
      6.   The lien upon real property authorized herein shall be subject and
inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages,
liens, and encumbrances of record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien
obtained under the provisions of the articles shall be made upon judgment of
foreclosure and order of sale. The city reserves the right to bring an action
to enforce the lien in Superior Court in the county in which the property is
located at any time after the recording of the assessment, but failure to
enforce the lien by legal action shall not affect its validity.
      7.   The recorded assessment and lien shall be prima facie evidence of
the truth of all of the matters recited therein and of the regularity of all
proceedings prior to the recording thereof.
      8.   However, if a property owner, occupant, or lessee signs a consent
form that allows city employees to enter his or her private property to remove
or abate the graffiti the city will not assess a cost to the property owner,
occupant, or lessee for the removal or abatement of the graffiti.

§ 12-5-8 EXTENSIONS.
   A.   Planned extensions. The city may from time to time, through the
creation by the county of special taxing districts or by other means, plan
sewer extensions in specific areas of the county. The costs of these extensions
and terms of payment may be set forth individually by county ordinance or
resolution.
   B.   Sewer extensions other than planned extensions. Where properties are to
be served by extensions which are not planned extensions, sewer facilities
shall be extended on the following basis.
      1.   Application (by developers or others). An application shall be
required for extension of sewer service under the provisions hereof, and shall
be in writing and signed by the developer or developers desiring city sewer
service. The application shall be filed with the Public Works Director and
shall include a legal description of the property and shall indicate the name,
street address, lot and block number, and the street frontage of each site,
along with the proposed usage. Each applicant shall agree to connect to and use
the city sewer service for his or her property. No sewers, or connections to
sewers, will be extended until the charges for sewer service, as further
outlined, have been provided for.
      2.   Processing of application. Upon receipt by the Public Works Director
of a proper application requesting a sewer main extension, it will be evaluated
and, if not feasible, returned with the proper explanation. If feasible, the
cost to the developer will be estimated and submitted to the developer for
consideration. If the developer decides to proceed further with the project and
final zoning of the project has been approved, at the developer's request, the
Public Works Director shall prepare and submit an agreement specifying all
terms and conditions for service and related costs to the developer.
      3.   Basis of payment for extensions. The cost to the developer shall be
the payment of the connection charges and construction costs as further
outlined. The allocation of costs for oversizing sewers and rebates in regard
to off-site sewers are outlined in §
12-5-9E. and H.
      4.   Sewer extended past property line. Each developer may be required to
extend one sewer line to an upstream limit of his or her property which will
terminate at an upstream manhole determined by the Public Works Director with
respect to the complete system, rather than at the end of the particular
extension requested. At the discretion of the Public Works Director, temporary
cleanouts at the property line may be allowed in lieu of extension to a
proposed manhole location. The charges or costs to the developer will include
the cost of sewer to the upstream property line of the development.
   C.   Right to refuse service. The city shall have the right at all times to
refuse to extend service on the basis of a use detrimental to the sewer system,
lack of payment of required fees, or for any reason which, in the opinion of
the Public Works Director, will cause the extension not to be in the public
interest. No payment of any costs, submitting of any petition, or any other act
to receive sewer service shall guarantee sewer service.
(Ord. 121, passed 12-4-1979)
§ 12-5-9 CONSTRUCTION OF SEWERS; CONNECTIONS.
   A.   Sewer construction by developer. Sewers to be constructed by the
developer or his or her contractor shall be constructed in accordance with the
following provisions.
      1.   Plat approval. In the case of subdivisions, the application shall be
accompanied by two copies of a recorded plat, or, in the case of a new
subdivision, an approved tentative plat, or preferably a master tentative plat
or a large scale development plan plus a plan showing location of proposed
sewer extensions.
      2.   Other governmental approval. Prior to final acceptance, all the
sewer extensions shall be approved by the appropriate state agencies and the
County Department of Public Health.
      3.   Materials and construction standards. All materials and labor shall
meet the specifications currently required by the city. All construction shall
be performed under the inspection of the city and in strict compliance with the
standards of the city and either city or county public works manuals, whichever
is applicable.
      4.   Costs. The developer will pay all connection charges and
construction costs prior to connecting to the city's system, unless otherwise
specified in an agreement between the developer and the city. Construction cost
will be the cost of sewer lines of sufficient capacity to collect the sewage in
the proposed development and transport it to the nearest adequately-sized city
sewer. Connection charges are defined in §
12-5-12 hereinafter.
      5.   Oversizing. The city reserves the right to oversize any extension
and will pay for the oversizing on the basis of additional costs beyond that
necessary to serve only the subject development. The city will pay an
established unit amount based upon the pipe size of a facility multiplied by
the length of that facility. The established unit amount will be determined by
the Public Works Director based on the flow requirements of the developer and
the city's study of current construction costs. The city will credit the
developer for the cost of the city's share of oversized sewers and this credit
will be in the form of a reduction of the connection charge or a cash payment
if the connection charge is more than offset. The city also reserves the right
to limit the amount of its participation in the cost of oversizing, depending
on current economic conditions or other factors. The rates of credit related to
the difference in diameter between the pipe required for the developer's
project and the pipe required by the city to be installed are specified as
follows:
 
Pipe Size Difference in Inches Credit per Inch Diameter per Lineal Foot
Force Mains
8 and greater                  $1.35
Gravity Sewer Mains
8 and greater                  $1.50
 
      6.   Maintenance bond. Sewers installed under this section shall become
part of the city's system; however, before acceptance, a contract bond,
approved by the City Council, equal in the amount of 100% of the construction
cost shall be required to guarantee all work and materials for a period of one
year after acceptance by the city. Terms and conditions of the bond must meet
the city's standards.
      7.   Construction permit. A permit for construction must be obtained by
the developer from the appropriate governmental agency.
      8.   Repayment policy. In those cases where a developer does not utilize
all of the capacity of a sewer extension he or she has paid for and which has
not been oversized, others may connect into it. The city will make every effort
to collect applicable construction connection charges from those others and
make repayments to the developer, but shall only be liable for moneys
collected. The connection charge is specified in division A.9. of this section.
A developer shall not be repaid sums in excess of his or her original
investment, less his or her use, in the sewer extension. The repayment shall
only be made during an eight-year period commencing with the date of an
executed agreement between the developer and the city for sewer service.
      9.   Construction connection charge. The construction connection charge
shall be as per §
12-5-2. The period of the repayment is limited to eight years from the date of
the initial execution of the developer agreement with the Authority.
   B.   Public easement required. No sewer facility will be installed under the
provisions outlined herein and accepted by the city for operation and
maintenance, unless it is in a public right-of-way or easement with a minimum
width of 12 feet. Conveyance of all easements shall be by a separate document
in recordable form to be approved by the city and shall be accompanied by a
written certification by an attorney licensed to practice law in the state that
the developer is the owner in fee simple of the property to be conveyed by the
easements and that, upon its execution by the developer, a valid and
enforceable easement in the developer's property will be vested in the city. No
sewer facilities to be owned and operated by the city shall be installed under
any building or appurtenance thereto.
   C.   Conveyance and ownership. All sewer facilities and appurtenances to be
owned by the city shall be conveyed to the city by proper bill of sale
immediately after the city's acceptance, in writing, of the construction of the
system. The developer shall also provide copies of paid bills and/or lien
waivers, releases, or satisfactions, together with a breakdown of the actual
cost of the facilities. Concurrently with the documents required above, the
developer shall furnish the city with one set of Mylar and electronic as-built
drawings showing specific locations, depths, elevations to be on city elevation
datum, and the like of all sewer facilities and appurtenances. When accepted
and properly conveyed to the city for ownership, maintenance, and operation,
the facilities shall become and remain the property of the Authority, and no
person shall by the payment of any charges provided for herein, or by causing
any construction of facilities accepted by the city, acquire any interest or
right in any of these facilities, or any portion thereof, other than the
privilege to have his or her property connected thereto for sewer service in
accordance with these procedures and regulations.
   D.   Minimum size, velocity, and length of gravity sewers.
      1.   The minimum size of plumbing shall be as regulated by the Building
Code.

laterals and four feet for main line sewers.
      7.   The minimum inside diameters of sewer manholes shall be 23 inches
for the cover frame opening and 48 inches at the base.
      8.   New gravity sewers shall discharge into existing gravity sewers
where possible. In the event that a pumping station is required, the design of
the tributary gravity system shall be such as to permit the present or future
extension of the system's gravity service area to the maximum practical extent.
To this end, the depth to invert at the pumping stations shall be in the range
of 12 to 14 feet and shall permit extension of gravity lines not less than one-
half mile. New force mains shall discharge into existing force mains.
      9.   The design and layout of the system shall be subject to approval by
the Public Works Director as to conformance with city standards and its master
sewer plan. The developer shall include provisions required by the city to
carry out the intent of the master planning and will be reimbursed for the
additional cost of oversized facilities.
   E.   Approvals. No sewer extension will be accepted by the city without the
approvals of the Public Works Director and the appropriate state agency and the
City Engineer.
   F.   Unauthorized work on sewer system. No person shall tamper with, work
on, uncover, make connection with, or in any way alter or damage any city sewer
or sewer appurtenance without written permission of the Public Works Director
or his or her appointed representative. Further, no unauthorized person shall
cause storm water, ground water, or any other unauthorized water or material to
enter the sanitary sewer system, including sanitary sewage from septic tank
trucks. This shall include the tying of downspouts or air-conditioning
condensate lines into the sewer system, raising of manhole lids to allow for
drainage, the dumping of garbage, refuse, or other wastes in manholes, the
draining of swimming pools into sewers, or any other means of causing or
allowing any substance not considered sanitary sewage, or not legally paid for
as sanitary sewage, to enter the sewer system. The offending person shall pay
the total cost of all charges attributable to the tampering and be subject to
all penalties as may be provided by law.
   G.   Common house connections. A single connection serving two or more
properties will not be permitted. In no case will common plumbing to two or
more lots or parcels be allowed.
   H.   Extent of city maintenance. The city shall not be responsible for the
repair and maintenance of house connections to the service laterals, nor for
privately-owned pumping stations, force mains, and sewers. The city shall be
responsible only for the repair and maintenance of all public sewers, pumping
stations, and force mains in the city's system and shall make a diligent effort
to inspect and keep these facilities in good repair.
   I.   Customer's maintenance.
      1.   The customer shall be responsible for the maintenance of the
plumbing from the connection at the service lateral into and including the
house plumbing, if a common lateral is utilized for two adjacent properties. If
a single lateral is utilized exclusively for one property, the customer shall
be responsible for keeping the service lateral, in addition to the plumbing,
free from obstructions. In either case, the city shall have the right to
inspect the house connection and plumbing and to discontinue water service to
any customer or property owner who fails to maintain the plumbing to the extent
that it may or does cause harm to the sewer facilities.
      2.   In the case of municipally- or privately-owned utilities, the city's
responsibility for the cost of maintenance ends at the point of connection to
the city system. The city retains all rights to insist on proper maintenance of
these facilities and to exclude infiltration and/or harmful wastes by the
owners.
   J.   Connection to sewer required. For the better protection of the health
and convenience of the inhabitants, all persons owning real property adjoining
streets and alleys in which there are sewer pipes and mains of the sewer
system, and persons owning, leasing, or using real property or buildings or
fixtures thereon which can be served by sewers, shall cause to be connected all
privies, cesspools, and open and unconnected drains with the sewer system
within 90 days after receipt of verbal or written notice by the city.

be required. The Director shall at all times have free access to the premises
of any user of its facilities, and free access to the premises of any person
reasonably believed by the Director to be a user or possible user of its
facilities, for the purpose of inspecting, sampling, or testing the discharge
emanating therefrom, or any discharge which may emanate therefrom in order to
determine whether the discharge, or potential discharge, is acceptable or
unacceptable to the city. Where necessary, the Director may require the owner
of any premises which discharges to the system to install a suitable inspection
chamber, together with any necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
discharge, or potential discharge. The chambers, when required, shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Director. The chamber
shall be installed at the owner's expense and shall be maintained by him or her
so as to be safe and assessable at all times.
   C.   Acceptability or unacceptability of discharge; determination by Public
Works Director. The Director shall determine the acceptability or
unacceptability of any discharge to the system. The determination shall be made
on the basis of sound engineering and operational evaluations taking into
consideration the nature and concentration of the discharge, its point of entry
into the system, its compatibility with other discharges in the system, its
compatibility with the treatment facility receiving it, and all other factors
pertinent to the effect of the discharge on any part of the system or treatment
process.

to create any hazard in the receiving waters.
   K.   Discharge of certain materials permitted conditionally.
      1.   Certain toxic substances and pathogenic bacteria, admission of which
into the system would otherwise be prohibited, shall be acceptable in a
discharge if they are:
         a.   Reduced by treatment at the source to a point that will meet the
general purposes of these rules and regulations or come within any applicable
standards set thereon now or hereafter in accordance with these regulations; or
         b.   Discharged in such small concentrations so as to not be injurious
to personnel, sewers, any biochemical, biological, or other sewage treatment
process, or receiving waters.

      2.   The above limitations are intended to apply generally to all
industrial users within the city's sewerage system. If and when state or
federal regulatory agency regulations require a specific pretreatment
concentration for a specific industry, whichever is the more stringent
concentration level between these regulations and those regulations will apply.
   M.   Discharges containing ground garbage; approval of certain size grinders
required. Any discharge to the city's sewerage system containing garbage may be
made acceptable by means of grinding and dilution, provided, however, that the
installation of and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of
three-fourths horsepower (0.76 h.p. metric) or greater shall be subject to
review and approval by the Public Works Director prior to the installation and
operation and to periodic inspection by the city thereafter.
   N.   Discharges containing acids and bases; neutralization required. Any
water or wastes which are unacceptable pursuant to these regulations shall be
neutralized, diluted, or subjected to some other acceptable method of
pretreatment in order to render it acceptable to the city, in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter, prior to its discharge to the system. If
necessary, the use of automatically operating, diluting, or neutralization and
monitoring equipment shall be required. If, upon neutralization, the discharge
is sufficiently high in ionic strength as to continue to be unacceptable,
further pretreatment shall be required.
   O.   Discharge of odors; control by owner required. It shall at all times be
the responsibility of the owner to eliminate or control the emission of
offensive odors from building sewers to the system or the development of
offensive odors in the system as the result of a discharge. Whenever the
Director determines that offensive odors emanating from building sewers or
resulting from a discharge are present in the system, he or she shall require
the owner to take whatever steps are necessary to eliminate the odors from the
system. The cost of any devices which may be necessary to eliminate or control
the odors and all attendant expenses shall be borne by the owner.
   P.   Prevention of accidental release of unacceptable substances. There
shall be no connection to the system from any vessel, tank, container, or
receptacle of any kind used to receive, hold, store, or in any other way handle
any toxic or deleterious materials or substances, the discharge of which is
prohibited by these regulations through which quantities of the materials or
substances could accidentally or otherwise be discharged directly or indirectly
into the system. Persons who in the course of their business or otherwise
transport, store, receive, ship, or in any other way handle or process any such
materials or substances shall take precautions to prevent accidental spillage
of the substances to any connection to the system by way of floor drains,
basins, catch basins, downspouts, gutters, manholes, or any other such
connection. Whenever the Director determines that accidental spillage has
occurred through any connection to the system as described above, he or she
shall require the owner to eliminate the connection.
   Q.   Accidental release of unacceptable discharge; notification; charges. In
the event of any accidental release to the system of any unacceptable discharge
or of any substances or materials considered by the Public Works Director to be
toxic or deleterious, as provided in this chapter, it shall be the
responsibility of the user to notify the Public Works Director immediately, and
in no case later than one hour following such a discharge, so that remedial
action can be taken. Costs incurred to correct any damage resulting from such a
discharge shall be charged to the user and failure to report the discharge
shall result in an additional charge of $1,500 in addition to costs of
correction. Each discharge shall be considered separately and costs and charges
levied accordingly. Each day on which there is such a discharge shall be and is
hereby deemed to be a separate discharge and charges shall be levied
accordingly. The charges shall be collected by the city in the same manner as
all other charges set by the city.
   R.   Special agreements; application to district. Whenever necessary or
expedient in order to carry out the provisions of these regulations, the Public
Works Director may enter into special agreements with users of the city's
facilities setting forth terms under which the discharge of the users will be
acceptable to the city. The agreements shall be made only in accordance with an
application therefor made to the Board of Review pursuant to these regulations.
   S.   Discharge of unpolluted water where storm sewer is available. Whenever
separate storm and sanitary sewers are provided, required, or in use in any
area of the city, all unpolluted water, including all storm water, surface
water, ground water, roof runoff, uncontaminated cooling water, subsurface
drainage, or unpolluted industrial process water, shall be discharged to the
storm sewer. Whenever in such areas any such unpolluted water is found to be
discharged to sanitary sewer, the Director shall require the discharge to be
connected to the storm sewer at the expense of the user.
   T.   Appeal from determination regarding discharge. Any industrial user
whose discharge has been determined by the Director to be unacceptable in
accordance with these regulations or who disagrees with any other determination
of the Director hereunder may apply to the City Common Council for a review
thereof in accordance with these regulations.
   U.   Failure to comply with discharge regulations; charges. Any failure to
comply with any provision of this chapter shall result in an additional charge
against the person or premises so failing to comply in the amount of $500. In
addition, the person or premises shall be liable for any damages which occur to
the system as a result of the failure to comply with any provision of these
regulations, and each such failure to comply shall be and is hereby deemed to
be a distinct and separate failure and charges shall be applied accordingly.
The charges shall be collected by the city in the same manner as all other
charges set by the city.

Article 1-8
§ 12-5-11 BILLING PROCEDURES.
   A.   Applicability. This section applies only to customers served directly
by sewage disposal plants operated by the city, except where special rates are
provided in acquisition of other utilities. Charges and deposits for other
customers are governed by the special rate schedules in effect in their area.
   B.   Billing periods; due date. Bills for sewage disposal service will be
rendered monthly in connection with water bills.
   C.   Sewer charges. Each bill for sewage disposal service rendered to the
customers on the sewer system of the city shall be based upon a user charge as
per current fees adopted by the city. The volume of sewage flow and the charges
shall be as determined by §
12-5-12.
   D.   Guarantee deposits.
      1.   Upon opening an account, a minimum guarantee deposit as set forth in
§
13-1-1 shall be paid by each residential user at the time of making application
for service.
      2.   Any new user having sewage disposal service available to three or
more dwelling units or for operation of a place of business shall pay a
deposit, which shall be equal to approximately one and one-third times the
actual billing, with a minimum of $10.
      3.   Governmental agencies, churches, synagogues, and recognized
charitable agencies and public utilities having reciprocal agreements with the
city are not required to pay guarantee deposits.
      4.   The guarantee deposit is required as security for payment of the
customer's sewer bill. It is refundable to the customer upon termination of
service.
   E.   Delinquent bills.
      1.   Bills are due and late penalties assessed as set forth in §
13-1-1. Upon termination of service, the guarantee deposit shall be applied to
the outstanding bill for that customer and a final statement shall be rendered
showing the balance due.
      2.   Service shall not be reinstituted until the final statement is paid
in full and the user makes application for service and pays the guarantee
deposit at the then established rate, as provided hereinabove.
      3.   A user's water service shall be discontinued and no new application
shall be accepted at any new location when there remains an outstanding final
statement for unpaid sewer service at any previous location.
      4.   Sewer service, as such, will not be discontinued under any normal
circumstances. However, in cases where discontinuance is required for any
reason, including, but not limited to, nonpayment, the city shall instead
discontinue the water service.
(Ord. 121, passed 12-4-1979)
§ 12-5-12 RATES AND CHARGES.
   A.   Monthly rates. The monthly rates to be charged and collected by the
Sewer Department for services provided are hereby fixed as follows:
 
Monthly Sewer Service Rates
Class              Rate Amount; Type
A.    Residentia$34.79 - Flat rate
B.    Multi-Fami$21.00 - Meter charge
                   $13.09 - Per unit fee
C.    Commercial$15.90 - Base fee
                   $2.69 (per 1,000 gallons)
 
   B.   Sewer connection fees. All connections to the city's sewer system
requiring the use of a four-inch pipe or less shall pay a connection fee of
$200. For connections requiring the use of six-inch and eight-inch pipes, a
connection fee(s) of $400 and $600 respectively, will be charged.
   C.   Inspection fees for new construction. Under the supervision of the
Public Works Director, a physical inspection will be conducted to ensure that
connections are properly installed. An inspection fee of $50 shall be charged.
   D.   Other charges.
      1.   Turn-off and turn-on fees. Where property is serviced with city
water, there will be no turn-off and turn-on fee, as such, for sewer service.
However, to enforce these procedures and regulations, water service may be
discontinued and the existing charges for water service turn-on and turn-off
shall prevail. In this regard, water service may be turned off due to an
infraction of these rules and regulations and will not be turned on until the
time as the infraction is corrected and all costs due the city are paid.
      2.   Miscellaneous charges. Miscellaneous charges shall be made for any
work done by the city beyond normal maintenance or extension charges as
outlined previously. This work, which will include such items as moving
connections, relocating manholes, or any other work done at the property
owner's request for the benefit of the property owner, shall be charged for at
direct cost plus appropriate overhead. Payment in full for the estimated cost
will be required prior to doing this type of work with appropriate refunds, if
any, when the work is completed. Work will not commence until a written
understanding between the parties has been executed.
      3.   Temporary emergency treatment rates. In cases where a customer
desires to use any portion of the sewers or sewage treatment facilities for
disposal of sewage on a temporary basis, and is not properly connected to the
sewer system, he or she may apply for the service through the Authority which
will compute the costs and require payment in full prior to the use of the
system. Should this service be desired on a permanent basis, a proper charge
will be estimated and an agreement establishing terms and costs shall be
entered into between the city and the customer using the service. It is the
intent of the city to discourage this type of service, except in the case of
municipalities and private utilities, and to this end the city reserves the
right to refuse to accept and also to discontinue this type of service.
      4.   Tax clause. All of the city's rates, including minimum and other
charges and service guarantees, are dependent upon federal, state, county,
municipal, district, and other governmental taxes, license fees, and other
impositions, and may be increased or a surcharge added if and when any or all
of the taxes, license fees, and other impositions are imposed or increased.
   E.   Credit for sewage disposal charge for water not entering sewer system.
Where water used for lawn sprinkling, gardening, or commercial-industrial
purposes does not enter the sanitary sewer system, relief from payment of the
sewage disposal service charge on the presently-metered total water consumption
has been provided for as follows.
      1.   Water submeter. A customer may install on his or her metered water
line, at his or her own expense and subject to the inspection by the Authority,
a submeter to measure the water which does not enter the sewer system. The
sewage disposal service charge will be billed on the difference in consumption
between the two meters, provided, however, that the credit to be given shall
not reduce the sewage disposal service charge to an amount less than the
required minimum charge.
      2.   Sewage meter. A customer may install, at his or her own expense and
subject to the approval of the Public Works Director, a specially designed and
constructed sewage meter for accurately measuring all sewage discharged from
the premises.
      3.   Separate water meter. A customer may have installed by the city, at
his or her own expense, a separate metered connection with the water main to
measure the water which does not get into the sewer system. The bill for water
used through the connection will not include the sewage disposal service
charge.
      4.   Affidavit for non-use. A customer may file (between July 1 and
October 1 of each year) a notarized affidavit on the form prescribed by the
city stating that water was used regularly for sprinkling or for other purposes
that did not enter the sewer system during the preceding fiscal year (July 1
through June 30). Upon verification by a representative of the city, the
customer shall receive a credit equal to 3% of the total amount of the sewage
disposal service paid by the customer during the preceding year, provided,
however, that the credit to be given shall not reduce the sewage disposal
service charge to an amount less than the required minimum charge.

§ 12-6-2 CLASSES OF WATER SERVICE AVAILABLE.
   The city renders water service of four general classes.
   A.   Domestic water service. This service covers the normal use of water in
faucets, sinks, baths, urinals, toilets, water heaters, boilers, refrigerators,
and other similar fixtures or apparatus in residences, apartments, hotels,
stores, offices, and industrial buildings.

   C.   Short-term (temporary) water service. This service is available for
short periods of time upon application only, for street, sewer, and similar
construction, circuses, fairs, exhibitions, displays, lunch carts, camps,
ships, boats, and the like.
   D.   Other service. This service is available where submetering or separate
metering is required because the permanently-designated usage will not be
incorporated in the sanitary sewage flow for billing purposes.
(Ord. 175, passed 1-18-1988)
§ 12-6-3 REQUEST FOR SERVICE.
   A.   Domestic water service within the service limits of the city.
      1.   To obtain domestic water service from an existing distribution main,
application should be made at the office of the Building Inspector. The
applicant should make sure that the name of the customer, the street address,
and the legal description of the property to which service is to be rendered
are correctly entered upon the contract or agreement for service. When
feasible, the applicant should, before making application for service,
determine whether the property to be served is adjacent to the city
distribution system.
      2.   A customer first requesting water service for a property is required
to pay a service connection fee to defray installation costs. Additional
services to the same property may also be obtained at similar fees per meter
connection. The service connection fees will be collected only once for any one
metered service. Section 12-6-8 describes fees for various size services.
   B.   Fire protection water service within the service areas of the city. To
obtain the service, application should be made at the office of the Building
Inspector. In case of a new fire line and/or combination fire line and domestic
water service installation, it is necessary that the city be provided both plot
plans and plumbing plans for a cost estimate. After the cost has been
determined, it will be necessary for the applicant to sign the agreement or
contract for service or to send a letter authorizing the installation. However,
every applicant shall prepay the estimated cost of the installation from the
water main to the property line, including an isolating valve, a detection
check valve for determining leakage or illegal usage (plus the extension of the
proper size main if necessary), street repair, sidewalk repair, labor, concrete
vault for detection check valve, other related materials, and any other costs
as may be incurred in rendering service.
   C.   Fire hydrant service. A developer or customer requesting the
installation of fire hydrants in the service area of the city shall be required
to pay the installation cost, including the isolating valve, fire hydrant
assembly, pipe, fittings, street repair, sidewalk repair, labor, materials, and
any other costs as may be incurred in the installation. No fire hydrants may be
installed on any water main of less than six-inch size. A fire hydrant service
charge shall be required as described in §
12-6-10.
(Ord. 175, passed 1-18-1988) Penalty, see
Article 1-8
§ 12-6-4 AGREEMENTS OR CONTRACTS FOR SERVICE.
   A.   Application. Service is furnished only upon written application
submitted to and accepted by the city. The conditions of the application and
the resulting agreement or contract for service are binding upon the customer
as well as upon the city. The application will protect both parties from error
or irresponsible actions of others. Applications are accepted by the city with
the understanding that there is no obligation on the part of the city to render
service other than that which is then available from its existing facilities. A
copy of the application and the contract for service will be furnished to the
applicant on request.
   B.   Applications by agents. Applications for service requested by firms,
partnerships, associations, and the like shall be submitted, in writing, to the
city only by duly authorized agents legally empowered to represent them. When
service is rendered under a contract entered between the city and an agent or
the applicant, the use of the service by the applicant shall constitute full
and complete ratification of the contract.
   C.   Developer agreements. Agreements for the provision of water service for
new properties requiring the construction of water facilities shall, upon
request by a developer, be prepared by the city. (See §
12-6-6E.) Final zoning approval of a property must be obtained prior to the
city's preparation of the agreement.
   D.   Prior indebtedness. The city shall withhold or discontinue service
rendered under an application made by any member or agent of a family,
household, organization, or business until all prior indebtedness to the city
of the family, household, organization, or business has been paid in full.
   E.   Multiple premises served through same meter. When two or more premises
are served through the same meter, the owner of the premises must sign the
contract or contracts for water service and accept full responsibility for the
payment for all service rendered, since no method is available to the city for
prorating charges for service among the occupants of the several premises.
   F.   Short-term service. Short-term (or temporary) water service will be
supplied only when the city has available unsold capacity of mains, pipes,
pumps, and other equipment for the service requested. Applicants for the
temporary service shall pay to the city in advance the cost of installing and
removing any facilities necessary to furnish the service. Short-term service
will be rendered only to the designated location and only within the period of
time specified in the contract providing therefor, and shall be utilized only
by the contracting party.
   G.   Change of occupancy. When change of occupancy takes place on any
premises supplied by the city with water service, written notice thereof shall
be given at the office of the Clerk not less than two days prior to the date of
change by the outgoing customer, the outgoing customer to be held responsible
for all water service rendered to the premises until the written notice has
been received and the city has had reasonable time to discontinue service. If
the written notice has not been received by the city, the application of a
successor occupant for water service will automatically terminate the prior
account. For the convenience of its customers, the City Clerk will accept
telephone orders to discontinue or to transfer water service and will use all
reasonable diligence in the execution thereof. However, oral orders or advice
cannot be deemed to be binding and formal notification to the City Clerk.
   H.   Limitation of use. Water service purchased from the city shall be used
by the customer only for the purposes specified in the application for service,
and the customer shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the service to other
parties without the authorization of a formal agreement by the city. Water
service furnished to the customer will be rendered directly to the customer
through the city meter and shall be for the customer's own use and shall not be
remetered by the customer for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of
water service to lessees, tenants, or others, and under no circumstances shall
the customer or the customer's agent or any other individual, association, or
corporation install a meter for the purpose of so remetering the service
without the express approval of the city. In no case shall a customer extend
his or her lines across a street, alley, lane, court, avenue or other highway,
or property line without unity of title, in order to furnish service for
adjacent property through one meter, even though the adjacent property is owned
by him or her. In case of the unauthorized remetering, sale, or disposition of
service, the customer's service shall be subject to discontinuance until the
unauthorized remetering, sale, or disposition has been discontinued and full
payment has been made of all bills for service, calculated under proper
classifications and rate schedules, and until reimbursement in full has been
made to the city for all extra expenses incurred for clerical work, testing,
and inspections.
   I.   Customer's responsibility. The customer is responsible for all water
metered to him or her until such time as service is discontinued for one of the
following reasons.
      1.   The city receives notice from the customer to discontinue service as
of a certain advance date.
      2.   Service is discontinued by the city due to nonpayment of a regular
bill within 30 days after mailing of the bill.
      3.   Service is applied for by another customer at which time the former
service is automatically discontinued.
(Ord. 175, passed 1-18-1988)
§ 12-6-5 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.
   The city will, at all times, use reasonable diligence to provide continuous
service and, having used reasonable diligence, will not be liable to the
customer for failure or interruption of service. The city will not be liable
for any act or omission caused directly or indirectly by strikes, labor
troubles, accidents, litigation, shutdowns for repairs or adjustments,
interference by governmental agencies, failure of electric power, acts of God,
or other causes beyond its control.
(Ord. 175, passed 1-18-1988)
§ 12-6-6 EXTENSIONS TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
   A.   Minimum size. No water line less than six inches inside diameter shall
be accepted as part of the city water utility system. Six-inch water lines will
only be permitted in cul-de-sacs or dead ends when no future extensions can be
made. In all other cases, water lines shall have an inside diameter of no less
than eight inches.
   B.   Grid system. Distribution water lines of 12 inches inside diameter are
required on all section lines and distribution water lines of ten inches inside
diameter are required on all half section lines and distribution water lines of
eight inches inside diameter are required on all one-sixteenth lines.
   C.   Conditions of line extensions.
      1.   Beginning of line extensions. All line extensions to serve a lot,
lots, subdivisions, or developments shall begin at the nearest adequate
existing distribution line as determined by the city and City Engineer.
      2.   Water distribution lines.
         a.   All water distribution lines, other than those provided for in
division E.5. below, shall extend across the total frontage of the property or
development to be served. Where the property or development is on a corner and
fronts two exterior sides, total frontage shall mean one exterior side of the
property or of the development as determined by the City Engineer.
         b.   For a property on a corner that abuts a section line and a half
section line, or that abuts two section lines or two half section lines, the
frontage for a line extension shall mean the longest of the two exterior sides
abutting the section or half section lines.
         c.   Those properties meeting the conditions of division C.2.b. above,
where a line extension is required across the longest exterior frontage of the
property, are exempt from any reimbursement charge for a connection to a line
extension on the property's short exterior frontage when the extension is
required by the city for the purpose of looping the distribution system.
         d.   For those properties meeting the conditions of division C.2.b.
above, and where an adequate water distribution line already exists along one
of the two exterior frontages at the time of development, a line extension is
required to be installed across the property's remaining exterior frontage. The
property is exempt from any reimbursement charge for connection to the existing
water distribution line when required by the city for the purpose of looping
the distribution system.
      3.   Installment location. Distribution lines shall be installed only in
public streets, alleys, roads, and highways, and on other public and private
property where satisfactory rights-of-way can be obtained without involving
direct purchase or lease of land by the city.
      4.   Private streets or thoroughfares. Distribution lines may be
installed in private streets or thoroughfares to provide water service to
premises along the street, upon approval of the city, providing:
         a.   Right-of-way or easement provided is satisfactory to the city;
and
         b.   The city has no responsibility to maintain or repair the surface
of the street other than to restore it to its original condition after cutting
the street for installation of the water line after repairs to the line.
      5.   Property of the city. Distribution lines which are extended or
installed will become the property of the city after final inspection and
acceptance by the city.
      6.   Construction drawings. Construction drawings for water line
extensions, which are certified by a registered engineer, shall be submitted to
the City Engineer for approval and shall be in accordance with the city's
standard specifications for utility installations.
      7.   Payments. Payment is required for all water used in construction,
sterilization, and testing of water main extensions, and the contractor or
developer shall be held accountable for that cost. The amount of water used
shall be estimated by the city's authorized representative.
   D.   Planned extensions. The city may, from time to time, through the
creation by the county of special taxing districts or by other means, plan
water extensions in specific areas of the county. The costs of these extensions
and terms of payment may be set forth individually by county ordinance or
resolution.
   E.   Water extensions other than planned extensions. Where properties are to
be served by extensions which are not planned extensions, water facilities
shall be extended on the following basis.
      1.   Application (by developer or others).
         a.   An application shall be required for extension of water service
under the provisions hereof, and shall be in writing and signed by the
developer or developers desiring city water service. The application shall be
filed with the city and shall include a legal description of the property and
shall indicate the name, street address, lot and block number, and the street
frontage of each site, along with the proposed usage. Each applicant shall
agree to connect to and use the city water service for his or her property.
         b.   No water mains, or connections to mains, will be extended until
the charges for water service, as further outlined, have been provided for.
      2.   Processing of application. Upon receipt by the city of proper
application requesting a water main extension, it will be evaluated and, if not
feasible, returned with the proper explanation. If feasible, the cost to the
developer will be estimated and submitted to the developer for consideration.
If the developer decides to proceed further with the project and final zoning
of the project has been approved, at the developer's request, the city shall
prepare and submit an agreement specifying all terms and conditions for service
and related costs to the developer.
      3.   Basis of payment for extensions. The cost to the developer shall be
the payment of the connection charges and construction costs as further
outlined. The allocation of costs for oversizing water mains and rebates in
regard to off-site water mains are outlined in §
12-6-7A.5. and A.7.
      4.   Water main extended past property line. Each developer may be
required to extend one water main to an upstream limit of his or her property
rather than at the end of the particular extension requested. The charges or
costs to the developer will include the cost of the water main to the upstream
property line of the development.
      5.   Distribution line extensions within or bounding a development.
         a.   Installed by developer. Distribution lines shall be installed
within or bounding the development to locations and grades and of such sizes as
approved by the City Engineer and in conformance with city standards.
Distribution lines of sizes and at locations approved by the City Engineer and
in conformance with the city standards shall be installed for each lot within
the development prior to paving the adjacent street. Where the line extensions,
or a portion of the line extensions, do not meet the requirements listed in
division E.5. above, the developer will be required to pay the full cost of the
line extension or portion of the line extension. The city will enter into a
reimbursement agreement with the developer requiring future customers to pay a
pro rata share of the cost of the line extension if the initial service is
taken during the term of the agreement. (See division G. below.) The developer
shall install a minimum one-inch water service connection for each lot within
the development at his or her expense, concurrently with the water line
construction in the development. The service connections shall be guaranteed
against any and all defects by the developer for a period of one-year after
acceptance of the installations by the city. No one except authorized city
personnel shall be authorized to install, remove, or reinstall water meters
and, in the event the developer's contractor, plumber, or others remove,
change, or relocate water meters, the developer shall be charged the cost to
the city for restoring meters to their authorized and designated locations.
Fire hydrants shall be installed within and along perimeter streets of the
development at locations and to lines and grades approved by the City Engineer
and in conformance with city standards. The developer shall be responsible for
adjusting all water valves, meter boxes, and appurtenances to the approved
final grade before acceptance of the system by the city.
         b.   Installed by city. Subject to the limitation set forth below,
water line extensions of ten inches or larger sizes as required by the grid
system located on section lines and half section lines shall be installed by
city forces or by contract at city expense. Extensions installed and paid for
by the city will include the appropriate valves, tees, crosses, and the like,
as well as fire hydrants. Water service installations to serve individual lots
shall not be considered as a part of the line extension installed at city
expense, but may be included at the time of construction at the developer's
expense.
            i.   Line extensions are limited to a maximum per subdivision or
development per fiscal year as follows:
 
30-acre subdivision 1,320 LF
20-acre subdivision 990 LF
15-acre subdivision 660 LF
10-acre subdivision 330 LF
5-acre subdivision  165 LF
 
            ii.   Any subdivision or single lot five acres in size or smaller
will be limited to a maximum line extension of 165 lineal feet per fiscal year.
Any subdivision or development 30 acres or larger will be limited to a maximum
line extension of 1,320 lineal feet per fiscal year. Any line extensions in
excess of the limitation set forth in this division E.5., as revised, will be
eligible for a reimbursement agreement under provisions of division G. below.
         c.   Limitation on city installation. Funds for city-installed line
extensions are derived from a system development charge, as provided in this
section. The total dollar amount of funds available in any one fiscal year for
construction of distribution line extensions is limited by the city to an
amount equal to the cost of construction of a combination of one-half mile of
ten-inch and 12-inch main extensions. Distribution of available funds for line
extensions each fiscal year shall be on a first-come basis. The project
effective date for availability of funds is the date of the posting of
construction assurances with the City Engineer.
   F.   Right to refuse service. The city shall have the right at all times to
refuse to extend service on the basis of a use detrimental to the water system,
lack of payment of required fees, or for any reason which, in the opinion of
the city, will cause the extension not to be in the public interest. No payment
of any costs, submitting of any petition, or any other act to receive water
service shall guarantee water service.
   G.   Reimbursement agreements.
      1.   Eligibility.
         a.   When a ten-inch or larger line extension, conforming to the Water
Master Plan, is installed outside, abutting, or within the applicant's lot,
lots, subdivision, or development, and does not meet the requirements of
division E.5. above, for a line extension by the city, then the applicant shall
be eligible for a line extension agreement.
         b.   The city will enter into an agreement with the original applicant
for the line extension and will collect and return to the applicant, as
provided in the agreement, a distribution line reimbursement charge from
parties wishing to connect laterally to the line extension.
         c.   To be eligible for a reimbursement agreement, the original
applicant for the line extension must submit the certified costs of the
extension, as prescribed in this division G., within 120 days from the date of
acceptance of the line extension by the city. Eligibility must be established
in a timely manner so that project records and the utility atlas is fully
updated. The applicant shall be notified, in writing, of the availability of a
reimbursement agreement by the city. Before the end of the 120-day period, the
original applicant will be again notified, in writing, by the city of the 120-
day expiration date, and a 60-day extension will be granted if requested by the
original applicant.
      2.   Reimbursement charge.
         a.   The reimbursement charge will be based on one-half the cost per
lineal foot for the water line extension abutting the premises of the party who
desires to obtain a connection or connections to the line, or by a fee per acre
for the area served by the connection.
         b.   The certified cost per lineal foot for the water line extension
shall be obtained by taking the total cost for construction of the extension
divided by the total lineal feet of the water line extension that was
installed. The costs must be certified by both the developer's engineer and the
City Engineer.
         c.   The per acre fee shall be determined either by obtaining the
total cost of construction of the extension minus the pro rata share of cost
for the line extension belonging to the original applicant served by the line
extension, or by setting a fixed cost per acre. The cost to be certified by the
developer's engineer and the City Engineer. The method used for determining per
acre cost shall be determined by the City Manager.
      3.   Cost of construction. The cost of construction of a line extension
shall include the actual materials and installation costs of piping, valves,
and other appurtenances, and the engineering costs for preparation of plans and
specifications and costs of inspection and staking. The cost of water service
connections shall not be included in the cost of construction of the water line
extension for reimbursement purposes.
      4.   Payment by applicant for service connection.
         a.   An applicant for a service connection to a line which is subject
to a reimbursement agreement shall pay the appropriate reimbursement charge(s).
The charge(s) shall be in addition to all other applicable charges provided by
these regulations, including charges for distribution system development
charges, service connections, capacity charges, and fees for meter
installation.
         b.   A corner property meeting the provisions of division C.2. above
is exempt from payment of a reimbursement charge for connection to a line
extension on the property's "other" exterior frontage when the purpose is for
looping the distribution system. Applicants shall pay the distribution line
reimbursement charge prior to constructing their connection to the line
extension. This charge will be in addition to all other applicable charges
provided by these regulations, including charges for service connections,
capacity charges, and meter installations.
      5.   Maximum amount of reimbursement. The maximum amount of any
reimbursement shall be identified in the agreement but shall in no case exceed
100% of the total certified construction cost of the extension plus accumulated
interest. Interest to be compounded yearly and calculated based on the interest
rate of U.S. government treasury bills dated January 1 of each year following
the date of acceptance of the line extension. The interest rate for the last
months of a reimbursement period, if short of a full year, shall be at the
interest rate as of January 1 of that year.
      6.   Terms of reimbursement agreement. The reimbursement agreement shall
have a maximum term of ten years and shall close at the end of that period
whether or not the total amount of reimbursement has been made.
      7.   Agreement compliance. All reimbursement agreements shall comply with
the above terms.

Article 1-8
§ 12-6-7 CONSTRUCTION OF WATER MAINS; CONNECTIONS.
   A.   Water main construction by developer. Water mains to be constructed by
a developer or his or her contractor shall be constructed in accordance with
the following provisions.
      1.   Plat approval. In the case of subdivisions, the application shall be
accompanied by two copies of a recorded plat, or, in the case of a new
subdivision, an approved tentative plat, or preferably a master tentative plat
or a large scale development plan plus a plan showing location of proposed
water main extensions.
      2.   Other governmental approval. Prior to final acceptance, all the
water main extensions shall be approved by the appropriate state agencies and
the County Department of Public Health.
      3.   Materials and construction standards. All materials and labor shall
meet the specifications currently required by the city. In order to provide
adequate distribution and fire protection service, the normal minimum size for
a water main extension shall be eight inches. All construction shall be
performed under the inspection of the city and in strict compliance with the
standards of the city and/or the county public works manuals, whichever is
applicable. All lines being connected to city mains must meet city minimum
specifications and standards, regardless of whether the lines are inside the
city limits or not.
      4.   Costs. The developer will pay all connection charges and
construction costs prior to connecting to the city system unless otherwise to
the proposed development from the nearest adequately-sized city's water mains.
Connection charges are defined in §
12-6-10.
      5.   Oversizing. The city reserves the right to oversize any extension
and will pay for the oversizing on the basis of additional costs beyond that
necessary to serve only the subject development. The city will pay an
established unit amount based upon the pipe size of a facility multiplied by
the length of that facility. The established unit amount will be determined by
the city based on the flow requirements of the developer and the city's study
of current construction costs. The city will credit the developer for the cost
of the city's share of oversized water mains and this credit will be in the
form of a reduction of the connection charge or a cash payment if the
connection charge is more than offset. The city also reserves the right to
limit the amount of its participation in the cost of oversizing, depending on
current economic conditions or other factors. The rates of credit related to
the difference in diameter between the pipe required for the developer's
project and the pipe required by the city to be installed is $1.35 per inch
diameter per linear foot for pipe sizes greater than eight inches.
      6.   Construction permit. A permit for construction must be obtained by
the developer from the appropriate governmental agency.
      7.   Repayment policy. In those cases where a developer does not utilize
all of the capacity of a water main extension he or she has paid for and which
has not been oversized, others may connect into it. The city will make every
effort to collect applicable construction connection charges from those others
and make repayments to the developer but shall only be liable for moneys
collected. The rate utilized in computing the construction connection charge is
$6 per front foot of the connecting property, measured along the route of the
water main constructed by the developer. The period of the repayment is limited
to eight years from the date of the initial execution of the developer
agreement with the city. A developer shall not be repaid sums in excess of his
or her original investment, less his or her use, in the water main extension.
The repayments shall only be made during an eight-year period commencing with
the date of an executed agreement between the developer and the city for water
services.
   B.   Public easement required. No water main facility will be installed
under the provisions outlined herein and accepted by the city for operation and
maintenance unless it is in a public right-of-way or easement with a minimum
width of 12 feet. Conveyance of all easements shall be by a separate document
in recordable form to be approved by the city and shall be accompanied by a
written certification by an attorney licensed to practice law in the state that
the developer is the owner in fee simple of the property to be conveyed by the
easements and that, upon its execution by the developer, a valid and
enforceable easement in the developer's property will be vested in the city. No
water main facilities to be owned and operated by the city shall be installed
under any building or appurtenance thereto.
   C.   Conveyance and ownership. All water main facilities and appurtenances
to be owned by the city shall be conveyed to the city by proper bill of sale
immediately after the city acceptance, in writing, of the construction of the
facilities. The developer shall also provide copies of paid bills and/or lien
waivers, releases of satisfactions together with a breakdown of the actual cost
of the facilities. Concurrently with the documents required above, the
developer shall furnish the city with one set of as-built Mylar drawings
showing specific locations, depths, elevations based upon city elevation datum,
and the like, of all water main facilities and appurtenances. When accepted and
properly conveyed to the city for ownership, person shall by the payment of any
charges provided for herein, or by causing any construction of facilities
accepted by the city acquire any interest or right in any of these facilities,
or any portion thereof, other than the privilege to have this property
connected thereto for water service in accordance with these procedures and
regulations.
   D.   Approvals. No water main extension will be accepted by the city without
the approvals of the city, the appropriate state agencies, and the County
Department of Public Health.
   E.   Unauthorized work on water system. No person shall tamper with, or in
any way alter or damage, any city water main or appurtenance thereto without
written permission of the city. The offending person shall pay the total cost
of all charges attributable to the tampering and be subject to all penalties as
may be provided by law.

Article 1-8
§ 12-6-8 CONNECTIONS FOR SERVICE AND METERS; SERVICE CONNECTION FEES.
   A.   Service connection fees.
      1.   The city will provide a standard service line capable of serving the
size of meter requested for a lot or parcel adjacent to an existing
distribution main owned by the city upon advance payment by the customer of a
service connection fee. The fees for various meter sizes are as set forth in §
12-6-10.
      2.   At its option, the city may install a second five-eighths inch meter
on a one-inch service line upon advance payment by the customer of an amount
specified in the resolution. The minimum size of service line between a water
main and a meter shall be one inch.
      3.   In the event that a service line larger than two inches is necessary
to serve the customer with an adequate supply of water, the customer shall
provide the city with both plot plans and plumbing plans for a cost estimate.
After the cost has been determined, the city will install the adequate service
line upon application of the customer and advance payment by him or her of the
total estimated cost of the larger service line.
   B.   Service availability from existing systems. Water service to any
structure upon any given property shall only be rendered from city-owned mains
in public rights-of-way abutting the property. The determination as to the
availability of service from existing facilities shall be at the sole
discretion of the city. The city shall have the right to require extensions of
its water mains and other facilities for proper service or to require the
permanent legal agreements which the city deems necessary in order to carry out
the intent of this section.
   C.   Customer's obligations.
      1.   Customer's installation. Each customer's installation shall include
that part of the service line to be extended by the customer at his or her
expense to a point designated by the city, provided that the designated point
is on the property line of the premises adjacent to a public street, avenue,
court, lane, and the like. The customer's installation shall be extended to the
city's line at one side of the lot.
      2.   Type and maintenance. The customer's water pipes, apparatus, and
equipment shall be selected, installed, used, and maintained in accordance with
standard practice, conformable to rules and regulations of the city, and in
full compliance with all laws and governmental regulations applicable thereto.
The customer expressly agrees to abstain from utilizing any appliance or device
which may adversely affect the service, and the city reserves the right to
withhold or to discontinue service whenever any such apparatus or device is
used.
      3.   Change of customer's installation. No changes or increases in the
customer's installation, which will materially affect the proper operation of
the pipes, mains, or stations of the city, shall be made without the written
consent of the City Manager. The customer will be liable for any damage
resulting from a violation of this rule.
      4.   Inspection of customer's installation. All installations for water
service or changes therein shall be inspected, upon completion, by competent
inspectors to ensure that piping, equipment, and devices have been installed in
accordance with accepted standard practice and in compliance with the local
rules and building codes as may be in effect. Where inspection is required by
governmental rules or ordinances, the city shall discontinue service if the
inspecting agent notifies the city that the installation has not been approved.
The city reserves the right to inspect the customer's installation prior to
rendering service and from time to time thereafter, but assumes no
responsibility whatsoever for any portion thereof.
      5.   Indemnity to city. The customer shall indemnify, hold harmless, and
defend the city from and against any and all liability, proceedings, suits,
costs, or expenses for loss, damage, or injury to persons or property, in any
manner directly or indirectly connected with or growing out of the transmission
and use of water by the customer at or on the customer's side of the point of
delivery.
      6.   Protection of city property. The customer shall properly protect the
city property on the customer's premises, and shall permit no one to have
access thereto, except the inspection agents or persons authorized by law. When
service lines, meters, mains, or other equipment are damaged by contractors,
construction companies, governmental agencies, or others, the damage will be
repaired by the city and the cost thereof charged to the party or parties
causing the damage. In the event of any loss or damage to property of the city
caused by or arising out of carelessness, neglect, or misuse by the customer,
or by unauthorized parties with the customer's sanction, the cost of making
good the loss or repairing the damage shall be paid by the customer.
      7.   Access to premises. The duly authorized agents of the city shall
have access, at all reasonable hours, to the premises of the customer for the
purpose of installing, maintaining, and inspecting or removing city property,
reading meters, and other purposes incident to performance under or termination
of the city contract with the customer, and in that performance shall not be
liable for trespass.
      8.   Right-of-way. The customer shall grant or cause to be granted to the
city, and without cost to the city, all rights, easements, permits, and
privileges which, in its opinion, are necessary for the rendering and
maintaining of service.
   D.   Location of water meters. The customer shall provide meter space for
use of the city at a suitable and readily accessible location, preferably in
the sidewalk adjacent to his or her property. When the city considers it
advisable, adequate, and proper, space for the installation of meters and other
similar devices shall be provided by the customer within the premises to be
served and at no cost to the city. Whenever two or more meters are utilized to
supply the customer's premises, the meters will be grouped and the customer's
installation brought out by the customer to a meter location designated by the
city. Customers and their agents (such as employees, contractor, and the like)
are prohibited from placing any obstacles on or about meters, valves, and other
equipment which in any way obstruct free access to the equipment.
   E.   Installation of meters. The city will install and properly maintain, at
its own expense, all meters and metering equipment as may be necessary to
measure the water delivered to the customer. Submeters inside the customer's
property to measure water not entering a sewer system may be purchased and
installed by the customer at his or her own expense, upon special written
agreement. Title to meters and metering equipment shall be and remain in the
city, except only those meters and other metering equipment sold to the
customer under special written agreement.
   F.   Meter tests; standard of accuracy.
      1.   No meter will be installed which has an error of more than 2%, plus
or minus. Whenever a periodic or any other test shows that a meter exceeds
these limits, it will be adjusted or replaced.
      2.   In the interest of good service, the city will employ every
practicable means to maintain the commercial accuracy of its meters. Further,
upon written request from the customer, the city will test the customer's meter
or meters. If a meter is found to be not more than 2% fast or slow, the expense
of the test shall be borne by the customer. If the meter exceeds these limits,
the expense of the test shall be borne by the city and billing adjustment for a
period of not to exceed three months will be made. All meters are tested in the
city meter shop prior to installation at the customer's premises, and
periodically thereafter.
      3.   Any meter found to be defective or having ceased to register will be
adjusted or changed and the city will estimate the bill for the period either
by adopting and using the registration of a correct meter, or by a comparison
with the amount charged during the corresponding period of a previous year,
taking into account the capacity of the installation. In case of damage or any
injury to the meter or service on the customer's premises, the supply of water
may be discontinued by the city until the necessary repairs have been made and
the cost thereof adjusted between the city and the customer.
   G.   Connections for service.
      1.   Connections to the system for any purpose whatsoever are to be made
only by city employees or contractors with the full approval of the city. No
connection of any description, temporary or otherwise, is permitted on the
customer's installation between that portion of the customer's installation for
domestic water service and that portion of the customer's installation for fire
protection purposes.
      2.   The portion of the customer's installation for domestic water
service shall be so arranged that all domestic water service shall pass through
the meter. No temporary pipes, nipples, or spacers are permanent except for
temporary testing purposes by a plumber authorized by the city, and under no
circumstances are connections allowed which may permit water to bypass the
meter or metering equipment.
      3.   Any and all physical connections or arrangements of pipes are
prohibited between two separate piping systems on the customer's property, one
of which contains potable water from the water mains and another containing a
liquid from any other source such as a private well supply.
      4.   Any unauthorized connections shall render the service subject to
immediate discontinuance without notice, and service will not be restored until
the unauthorized connections have been removed, and unless settlement is made
in full for all water service estimated by the city to have been used by reason
of the unauthorized connections.

amount due, he or she may call or visit City Hall to arrange for a hearing on
the matter. If the city does not hear from the customer on a timely basis and

refunded.
      1.   All water used will be charged at the monthly rate as set forth
under division A. above: Water fees, Commercial.
      2.   No sewer or sanitation charge will be assessed during the

requiring to use of a three-quarter-inch meter or less shall pay a connection
fee of $475. The use of any larger size water meter needed to serve the
facility, shall be based on a charge of $475 per water times the corresponding
"Equivalency Factor" as indicated below:
      1.   The "Equivalency Factor" is determined by the maximum gallons per
minute (GPM) of flow through the water meter. The base for this factor is the
three-quarter-inch meter most commonly used for a single residential unit
having a flow rate of 30 GPM and a factor of one.
 
Connection Meter Size Flow Rate Equivalency Factor Connection Fee
3/4 in.               30 GPM    1.00               $475

2 in.                 160 GPM   5.33               $2,532
 
      2.   If a meter approved by the City Engineer is installed that differs
from the flow rates stated, the equivalency factor will be used to determine
the connection fee for that meter. This provision will apply to impact fees
also.
      3.   Expenses associated with connection resulting from factors beyond
the city's control shall be absorbed by the person requesting the connection.
This provision will apply to connection charges under §
12-5-12B. also.
