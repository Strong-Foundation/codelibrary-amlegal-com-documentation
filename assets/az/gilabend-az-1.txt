persons available; to assure that appointments and promotions of town employees
will be based upon merit and fitness, free of personal political consideration,
the following merit system for town employees is adopted.
(1996 Code, § 2.48.010) (Ord. 105, passed - -1982)
§ 36.02 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all employees of the town,
except elected officials, officers of the town appointed by the Council
pursuant to statute, persons engaged under contract to supply expert,
professional or technical services for a definite period of time, temporary
employees, volunteer firefighters and volunteer personnel who receive no
regular compensation from the town.

   (B)   The appointing authority, as designated by the Council, shall post a
notice of all vacant positions to be filled at least ten days prior to the date
the position or positions are to be filled on the official bulletin board of
the town. The notice shall contain the title of the position, duties to be
performed, salary or salary range to be paid, the person authorized to accept
applications and the date of examination if it is to be given.
   (C)   The appointing authority, after examination and evaluation of all the
applicants and, upon approval of the Council, shall appoint the applicant

permanently separated by resignation or dismissal.
   (B)   Whenever there is a lack of work or lack of funds requiring a
reduction in the number of employees, the reduction shall be made by the
appointing authority; provided, however, that, employees shall be laid off in
the inverse order of their length and quality of service.
   (C)   An employee may be suspended for a period not to exceed 15 working
days, without pay, when in the judgment of the appointing authority an
employee's work performance or conduct justifies the disciplinary action.
   (D)   An employee may be dismissed or demoted effective immediately whenever
in the judgment of the appointing authority the employee's work or misconduct
so warrants. When the appointing authority desires to take action, he or she
shall file with the employee and the Council a written notification containing
a statement of the reasons for the action. The notice shall inform the employee
that he or she shall be allowed two calendar weeks from the effective date of
the action to file a reply with the appointing authority and the Council and to
request a hearing before the Council.
   (E)   If the employee files a reply within the prescribed period, the
Council shall schedule a hearing. At the discretion of the employee, the
hearing may be private or open to the public. In conducting the hearing, the
proceedings shall be informal.
   (F)   The Council's findings and recommendations shall be final. Should the
Council not sustain the action of the appointing authority the employee shall
be reinstated to his or her former position without loss of pay.

      (2)   Not less than one-half of the revenues collected by the town tax
levied pursuant to this chapter shall be used as previously stated in division
(A) of this section. The remainder of the revenues shall be deposited into the
General Fund to defray the necessary and ordinary expenses of the town.
(1996 Code, § 3.08.010)
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      FINANCE DIRECTOR. The Finance Director of the town.
      HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied
or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel,
studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house,
dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed
location, or other similar structure or portion thereof, and also means any
space, lot or slab which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by
transients in a mobile home or house trailer furnished by them for the
occupancy. It includes any building or group of buildings containing sleeping
accommodations for more than five persons which are open to the transient
public. It does not mean any convalescent home or facility, home for the aged,
hospital, jail, military installation, fraternity or sorority house, nor does
it mean a structure operated exclusively by an association, institution,
governmental agency or corporation for religious, charitable or educational
purpose or purposes, no part of the earnings of which association or
corporation inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
      OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession
of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes.
      OPERATOR. The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the OPERATOR performs his or her functions through a
managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing
agent shall also be deemed an OPERATOR for the purposes of this section and
shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance
with the provisions of this section by either the principal or the managing
agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
      PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
corporation, municipal corporation, estate, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit and the plural as well as the singular number.
      RENT. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the

goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property
and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
      TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy
by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement
for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of
calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying space in a hotel shall be
deemed to be a TRANSIENT until the period of 30 days has expired unless there
is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for
a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a TRANSIENT,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this section may be considered.
(1996 Code, § 3.08.020)
   (C)   Registration. Within 30 days after effective date of the ordinance
codified in this section, or within 30 days after commencing business,
whichever is later, each hotel within the town renting occupancy to transients
shall be registered with the Director of Finance in the name of the operator. A
transient rental tax license will be issued and will be at all times posted in
a conspicuous place on the premises. The first of these licenses will be
automatically issued to those hotels currently holding a town business
privilege license, but this provision, in no way, relieves the operator of the
responsibility of registering the hotel and obtaining a license after the
effective date of the ordinance. Thereafter, the license will be issued with
the town business privilege license. The license shall, among other things,
state the following:
      (1)   Name and address of the operator;
      (2)   Address of the hotel; and
      (3)   The date upon which the license was issued.

provided herein, subject to the direction and supervision of the Town Manager
and the Mayor and Council; the Director of Finance or another person to whom he
or she may assign the duty of administering, assessing and collecting the taxes
imposed, is empowered to enforce the provisions of this section, together with

keep records and accounts as shall be necessary to adequately show separately
the taxes collected under each of the classifications and amounts collected
from businesses taxed by this section; the Director of Finance shall keep full
and accurate records of all moneys received by him or her, and shall preserve
all reports and tax returns filed with him or her pursuant to the terms hereof

obeyed by all persons taxed by this chapter, after three copies of any rules
and regulations shall have been filed in the office of the Town Clerk and there
kept for the use of any taxpayer and the public at any time during regular

§ 37.03 PROPERTY TAX.
   (A)   There is hereby levied on the assessed value of all property, both
real and personal, within the corporate limits of the town, except such
property as may be by law exempt from taxation, a tax sufficient to raise an
amount to be determined from time to time as necessary by the Town Council, for
the purpose of providing a general fund for the town, for the fiscal year
ending on the 30th day of June.
   (B)   No failure by the county officials to properly return the delinquent
list and no irregularity of any kind of any proceedings shall invalidate such
proceedings or invalidate any title conveyed by any tax deed; nor shall any
failure or neglect of any officer or officers to perform any of the duties
assigned on the day within the time specified work of invalidation of the
assessment and levy of taxes or of the judgment of sale by which the collection
of the same may be enforced or in any manner affect the lien of the town upon
such property for the delinquent taxes unpaid thereon, and no overcharge as to
part of the taxes or of costs shall invalidate any proceedings for the
collection of the property under foreclosure; and all acts of officers de facto
shall be valid as if performed by officers de jure.

EXTENSIONS
§ 51.30 PLANS, SPECIFICATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION.
   A developer who wishes to extend sewer facilities must employ a civil
engineer registered in the state to perform the field engineering and prepare
detailed plans and specifications for the sewer extension. The final detailed
plans and specifications for the main sewer extension must be approved by the
State Department of Health Services and by the Council before construction
begins. The design and engineering will be in accordance with the
specifications of the State Department of Health Services and the town prior to
construction. The construction shall meet the town's specifications,
requirements and approval and will be subject to inspection by the town's
agents during construction. Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the town
agrees to permit the developer to connect into the town's existing trunk sewer
lines and the main sewer line to be constructed by the developer, as herein
provided.
(1996 Code, § 13.08.070)
§ 51.31 AREA TO BE SERVED.
   The maximum area to be served by the proposed main sewer line and its
ultimate branches and laterals shall be determined by the Town Engineer based
on local drainage conditions. In the event that the area to be serviced by the
developer is less in size than the maximum area to be served by the proposed
main sewer line and its ultimate laterals, the aforesaid main sewer line shall
be designed, engineered and constructed to serve the maximum area described
heretofore. Should other parties in the service area desire to join with the
developer in constructing the proposed main sewer line, this agreement will be
considered as including additional parties.
(1996 Code, § 13.08.080)
§ 51.32 COSTS.
   The developer shall pay the costs for utility extensions using one of the
following two options:
   (A)   Option I. The developer shall pay in full for the rights-of-way, the
construction and installation of the lines, pipes and mains and all other
features for the extension; or
   (B)   Option II.
      (1)   The construction cost of the extension shall be determined and
agreed upon prior to commencement of construction after the developer has
submitted a cost breakdown to the Town Engineer. The engineering costs incurred
by the developer for the preparation of plans and staking of the main sewer
line only may be included in the agreed construction cost. Costs of lateral and
branch sewers and their appurtenances will not be included in the agreed
construction cost or in the main sewer project agreement. The town reserves the
right to reject the developer's cost breakdown if it is in appreciable variance
with the town's estimate.
      (2)   In the event that the area to be serviced by the developer is the
entire area described herein as the maximum service area, then the developer
will pay in full for the construction cost and will not be eligible for
repayment. In the event that the area to be serviced by the developer is less
in size than the maximum area to be serviced by the proposed main sewer line
and its ultimate branches and laterals, the town agrees to enter into an
agreement with any party desirous of obtaining a connection to the main sewer
line. The agreement will establish a just, equitable and reasonable charge to
permit a connection, the charge to be made on a cost-per-acre basis of the area
to be served, using the heretofore agreed main sewer line construction cost and
maximum service area acreage to determine the cost per acre. The amount of the
connection charge will be paid to the town, who agrees to repay the amount to
the developer, the total of the repayments not to exceed that portion of the
agreed construction cost of the main sewer line allotted to acreage outside the
service area of the developer.
      (3)   In no way is any agreement to be construed as including any branch
or lateral sewer within the service area.
(1996 Code, § 13.08.090)
§ 51.33 CHARGES.
   Any connection charge shall not affect the right of the town to assess its
regular tax charges and sewage rental charges against the owners of property
within the developer's area. Building or house connection charges shall be paid
to the town at the prevailing rate and are not refundable.
(1996 Code, § 13.08.100)
§ 51.34 OWNERSHIP.
   The town shall have exclusive control of connections to the proposed main
sewer line and, upon its completion, the aforesaid main line shall become and
be the property of the town. Except as otherwise herein provided, all
provisions of the town code and ordinances, resolutions or amendments thereto
applicable to sewer services including all sewer charges shall apply to
services in the proposed area.

   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
dischargers into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the town
and enables the town to comply with a POTW pretreatment program mandated by the
NPDES permits issued by the EPA to the town POTW and all applicable state and
federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 as amended by the Water
Quality Act of 1987 and the general pretreatment regulations (40 C.F.R., part
403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipality
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To protect the town's sewerage system, groundwater resources,
effluent receiving water ways, and to prevent the introduction of pollutants
into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, groundwater resources, or the
atmosphere;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system;
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system; and
      (5)   To protect both publicly-owned treatment works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public.
   (C)   This chapter includes the technical based local limits reports:
"Defining and Justifying Local Discharge Limits Under EPA's Pretreatment
Program, Volume One and Two."
   (D)   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges to the
municipal wastewater system through, the issuance of permits to certain non-
domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other
users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user
reporting, assumes that existing customer's capacity will not be preempted, and
provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs
resulting from the program established herein.
   (E)   This chapter shall apply to the town and to persons outside the town
who are, by contract or agreement with the town, users of the town POTW. Except
as otherwise provided herein, the Public Works Director of the town POTW shall
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

that:
      (1)   The building, structure, facility or installation is constructed at
a site at which no other source is located;
      (2)   The building, structure, facility or installation, totally replaces
the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at
an existing source; or
      (3)   The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility or installation are substantially independent of an
existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source should
be considered. Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria
of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process
or production equipment. Construction of a new source as defined under this
subsection has commenced if the owner or operator has begun or caused to begin
as part of a continuous onsite construction program. Any placement, assembly,

§ 52.020 MODIFICATION OF FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Where the town's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the town may apply to the
approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount
of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by 95% of the samples when measured according to the procedures set
forth in C.F.R., part 403, Section 403.7(c)(2) "General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to
the Act. The town may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal
pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 C.F.R., part 403,
Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is
obtained.
(Ord. 09-03, passed 2-10-2009)

outlet within the town, in any area under the jurisdiction of the town, and/or
to the POTW any wastewater except as authorized by the Public Works Director in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 09-03, passed 2-10-2009)
§ 52.046 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (A)   Permit for industrial wastewater discharge.
      (1)   Except as hereafter provided, no person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to sewerage
facilities owned by the town without first obtaining a town wastewater
discharge permit (permit). A town permit shall be obtained prior to
commencement of any construction of new or modified facilities which will
discharge industrial wastewater to the sewer. A separate permit shall be
required for each industrial wastewater connection to a public sewer
discharging directly or indirectly to the town's sewerage system. The use of a
sewer connection which is the subject of a permit by anyone other than the
person named in the permit is prohibited. A permit or permit revision shall
also be obtained by dischargers who use industrial wastewater. Any person who
operates a portable treatment system must receive written authorization from
the Public Works Director prior to commencement of operations at any industrial
facility. Any person operating a portable treatment system shall comply with
all requirements established by the Public Works Director for such systems. A
permit shall also be obtained by all persons generating industrial wastewater
including waste haulers.
      (2)   The Public Works Director may exempt certain classes of dischargers
of industrial wastewaters from the requirement to obtain a permit if the
quantity and quality of the wastewater is determined to be unlikely to create
significant effects on the town's sewerage system or produce violations of
state law or federal regulations. A discharger will be exempt if they
permanently plug all floor drains and other discharge lines other than domestic
wastes.
      (3)   The permit may require pretreatment of industrial wastewaters
before discharge, restriction of peak flow discharges, relocation of point of
discharge, consolidation of wastewater discharge connections, prohibition of
discharge of certain wastewater components or characteristics, batch treatment
and discharge, restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, and such
other conditions as may be required to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
      (4)   Permits for facilities that receive for treatment, recycling or
reclamation one or more wastes generated off-site, may additionally require
monitoring of influent wastestreams and may restrict the types and quantities
of wastes accepted.
      (5)   A permit shall be required but not limited to existing and new
industries, car washes, vehicle service stations or repair garages, radiator
shops, equipment shops, laundries, dry cleaners, hospitals, animal groomers,
barber shops, beauty salons, restaurants, nursing homes, veterinary clinics,
printers, grocery stores, mortuaries, cafeterias, x-ray labs, medical and
dental facilities, printers, photo processors and chemical manufacturers. These
businesses, however, shall be responsible for insuring that the industrial
wastewater discharges originating from their operations are in compliance with
the provisions set forth in this chapter.
      (6)   No person shall discharge industrial wastewaters in excess of the
quantity or quality limits stated in the permit the violation of any permit
condition or requirement shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall
be punishable as provided by law. Any person who, as defined by the Public
Works Director, significantly increases or decreases flow rate or significantly
alters the quality of wastewater discharge shall immediately apply for and
obtain a permit revision. Any discharger who modifies an industrial plant,
operating mode, process, or wastewater treatment facility in a manner which, as
defined by the Public Works Director, would significantly increase or decrease
the flow rate or significantly alter the quality of the wastewater discharge
described in a permit shall first apply for and obtain a permit revision. This
permit revision shall be obtained prior to the commencement of any construction
of new plant facilities or operation of modified facilities by the wastewater
discharger.
      (7)   All users proposing to connect to or to contribute to the POTW
shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit before connecting to or contributing
to the POTW. All existing users connected to or contributing to the POTW shall
obtain a wastewater discharge permit within 30 days after the effective date of

regulated stream i
Fi   =   The average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) of stream i to the
extent that it is regulated for such pollutant
FD   =   The average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) from boiler blow
down streams, non-contact cooling streams, sanitary wastestreams, and
demineralizer back wash, streams where such streams are not regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard
FT   =   The average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) through the
combined treatment facility (includes Fi and FD)
N   =   The total number of regulated streams
   (B)   The categorical user shall comply with the alternative pollutant limit
fixed by the Public Works Director until the Public Works Director modifies the
limits or approves a user modification request. Modification is authorized
whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the
calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant.
   (C)   An alternative discharge limit may not be used if the alternative
limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated
pollutants. As a result, the combined wastewater formula cannot be used, and
wastestreams must be segregated.

§ 52.049 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The town shall require to be provided and operated at the categorical
and significant user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the categorical
and significant user's premises, but the town may, when such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (B)   As a condition of the permit, all discharged industrial wastewater
shall pass through a designated sampling location. There shall be ample room in
or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate flow proportional
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility flow metering
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the town's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the town.

§ 52.050 PRETREATMENT.
   (A)   The Public Works Director may require an existing or new user to
provide wastewater pretreatment systems or facilities when the Public Works
Director determines that it is necessary to treat industrial flows prior to
discharge to the sewer, to restrict or prevent the discharge to the sewer of
certain waste constituents, to distribute any peak discharges of industrial
wastewaters more equally over a longer time period, to comply with any state
discharge or pretreatment requirements, to comply with federal pretreatment
standards, or to accomplish any pretreatment result required by the Public
Works Director in order to effectuate the purposes of the chapter. Any
pretreatment facilities required by the Public Works Director shall be provided
and maintained at the expense of the user. Pretreatment systems or facilities
shall not be installed or operated without the prior written approval of the
Public Works Director. The requirement for such approval, however, shall not
absolve the user of the responsibility for meeting any industrial wastewater
discharge limitation imposed by the town or by the state or federal government
if inspections or other information reveal that pretreatment systems and
facilities are not installed or operated in conformance with the plans and
procedures submitted to and approved by the town, or are not operated in
compliance with the discharge requirements and limitations imposed by the town,
the user shall make such modifications as are necessary to meet such
requirements. Users who have the potential to discharge significant levels of
flammable substances, as defined by the Public Works Director, shall install
and maintain approved combustible gas detection meter systems. All pretreatment
systems determined by the Public Works Director to require engineering design
shall have plans prepared and signed by a civil, chemical, or mechanical
engineer registered in the state or a registered engineer of other suitable
discipline as determined by the Public Works Director.
   (B)   The Public Works Director may require any user discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Gravity separation interceptors, equalizing tanks, neutralization
chambers, control manholes or other monitoring facilities, and spill
containment systems, may be required by the Public Works Director as he or she
deems necessary to remove prohibited settleable and floatable solids, to
equalize wastewater streams varying greatly in quantity and/or quality, to
neutralize low or high pH wastewater, to facilitate inspection, flow
measurement and sampling, and to prevent discharge to the sewer of quantities
of prohibited or restricted materials resulting from a rupture of a tank or
pipeline or other such accidental occurrences. Spill containment systems shall
conform to guidelines established by the Public Works Director. Floor drains
from existing or new service garages, repair shops, equipment shops and
vehicular maintenance facilities are not allowed.
   (D)   The town shall annually publish in the largest daily town newspaper a
list of users which were in significant noncompliance. The names of the

(Ord. 09-03, passed 2-10-2009)
§ 52.054 GREASE INTERCEPTORS AND GRAVITY SEPARATING DEVICES.
   (A)   Restaurants (existing and new). All restaurants or food service
facilities shall install an approved grease interceptor which is of sufficient
size so as to prevent excessive discharges of grease into the town's sewerage
system. The grease interceptor shall be easily accessible for inspection by the
Public Works Director. Exceptions to the installation of a grease interceptor
shall be determined on a case- by-case basis by the Public Works Director. The
Public Works Director shall take into account the following items when
determining exceptions:
      (1)   Size of restaurant;
      (2)   Meals served per day;
      (3)   Daily water usage based upon water bills;
      (4)   Seating capacity;
      (5)   Dishwasher and garbage disposal facilities on-hand.
   (B)   Car washes, radiator shops, vehicle service stations, and garages
(existing and new). Car washes will be required to install mud pits and a
gravity separating device designed to prevent the discharge of sand, silt, oil
and grease to the town's sewerage system. Radiator shops, vehicle service
stations, and garages will be required to plug floor drains and remove sinks in
the service bays and repair shops.
   (C)   Laundries and dry cleaners (existing and new). After the effective

Establishments in existence prior to this date shall install an appropriate
pretreatment system if in the opinion, of the Public Works Director the system
is warranted.
   (D)   Existing gravity separating device and grease interceptors. If the
Public Works Director finds that a grease interceptor or gravity separating
device installed prior to the effective date of this chapter is incapable of
retaining adequately the grease or sand and oil in the wastewater flow from a
service station, car wash or restaurant or similar establishment, the Public
Works Director shall give the proprietor a written notice requiring that an
adequate interceptor or gravity separating device be installed within 90 days.
   (E)   Approved designs.
      (1)   The Public Works Director may maintain an information file
available for public use of acceptable designs of grease interceptors and
gravity separating devices. The installation of a design shown in such file or
of any design meeting the size requirement set forth in this chapter or any
recommendation of requirements made by the Public Works Director shall not
impute any liability to the town for the adequacy of the interceptor or gravity
separating device under the actual conditions of use. Such installation shall
not relieve the owner or proprietor of responsibility for keeping prohibited
substances or substances above the limitations of this chapter out of the
town's sewerage system, if the interceptor, gravity separating device or other
pretreatment facility is not adequate under the conditions of use, one shall be
constructed which is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose.

   (F)   Maintenance of grease interceptors and gravity separating devices. Any
grease interceptor or gravity separating device required by this chapter shall
be readily accessible for inspection and properly maintained to assure that the
accumulations of grease or sand and oil do not impair its efficiency or pass
out with the effluent. All users required to use and maintain a grease
interceptor or gravity separating device shall maintain a maintenance record.
This record shall include the date, the name of the person who cleaned it and
the disposal site of the waste. The report shall be reviewed by the Public
Works Director at each routine inspection. Persons hauling wastes and
wastewater removed from these interceptors or gravity separating devices shall
be registered to do so by the proper permitting agency. An interceptor or
gravity separating device shall not be considered properly maintained if
material accumulations total more than 25% of the operating fluid capacity. The
town will endeavor to inspect all grease interceptors and gravity separating
device at least yearly, if it is found that it is improperly maintained or
adequate records are not being kept, a warning will be issued to the owner and/
or user of the property, if on subsequent inspections it is found that one of
the above conditions continues to exist, a fine shall be levied against the
owner and/or user of the property.

that generators of hazardous waste listed under 40 C.F.R., part 261 have a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste generated to the
extent that is economically practical. A waste minimization program is an
organized, comprehensive, and continual effort to systematically reduce waste
generation. Generally, a program is established for the organization as a
whole. Its components shall include specific waste minimization projects and
shall use waste minimization assessments as a tool for determining where and
how waste can be reduced. A waste minimization program shall reflect the goals
and policies for waste minimization set by the organization's management. Also,
the program shall be an ongoing effort and strive to make waste minimization
part of the company's operating philosophy.
   (B)   Users who discharge to the POTW with a substance, which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R., part 261 are subject

MONITORING, REPORTING, NOTIFICATION AND INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS
§ 52.075 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   Compliance date report for categorical users (existing and new).
      (1)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the Public Works Director a report. The report shall be certified by a
qualified professional. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the categorical user using the certification presented in §
52.079.
      (2)   New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and
shall start-up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable
pretreatment standards.
      (3)   For categorical users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the Public Works Director, this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other
industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure
of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during
the appropriate sampling period.
   (B)   Periodic compliance reports for significant users (existing and new).
      (1)   All categorical and significant industrial users subject to a
pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard,
or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the
POTW shall submit to the Public Works Director during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by
the Public Works Director, a report indicating the nature and concentration, of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In
addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average
and maximum daily flows for the reporting period, for the discharge reported in
the user's permit, this report shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the significant user using the declaration indicated in §
52.079.
      (2)   The Public Works Director may impose mass limitations on users
which are using intentional or unintentional forms of dilution (for example,
combination of waste streams, boiler blowdown, and the like) to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition
of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by
subsection (1) shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Public Works
Director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the
applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by 40 C.F.R., part 136.

§ 52.076 INSPECTION.
   (A)   The town shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the town or their representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examining or copying any records that must be kept under conditions
of the permit, and/or in the performance of any of their duties. Inspection may
include any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and control equipment),
practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit. The town will
randomly inspect and sample all categorical and significant industrial users at
least once a year. All associated sampling costs will be incurred by the user.
   (B)   The town will randomly inspect industrial users and conduct
surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information
supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with
pretreatment standards. The town will evaluate, at least once every two years,
whether each such categorical and significant industrial user needs a plan to
control slug discharges (§
52.017).
   (C)   The town shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations for any substances or parameters at any location for
the purposes of assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the
chapter.
   (D)   Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town, will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.

§ 52.077 MONITORING, SAMPLING AND RECORDS.
   (A)   All categorical and significant industrial users shall monitor for
wastewater constituents on a monthly basis as may be specified by the Public
Works Director or required under applicable state law, federal pretreatment
standards, or federal regulations. Categorical users shall monitor for all
federal limited parameters at least twice a year and for all Clean Water Act
priority pollutants at least once per year. Wastewater flow measurements and
samples shall be collected and analyzed in a state certified laboratory. The
laboratory results shall be submitted with the monthly report in the month they
are received. Laboratory analysis and associated sampling costs will be paid
for by the user.
   (B)   Samples and measurements taken for the purpose of monitoring shall be
representative of the monitored activity. Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream
from the process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula of §
52.048 in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where
an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with
§
52.048, this adjusted limit along with the supporting data shall be submitted
to the Public Works Director.
   (C)   The user shall retain records of all monitoring information, including
all calibration and maintenance records and all original ship chart recordings
for continuous monitoring instrumentation, copies of all reports required by
the permit, and records of all data used to complete the application for the
permit, for a period of at least three years from the date of the sample,
measurement, report or application. This period may be extended by request of
the Public Works Director (for example, during unresolved litigation).
   (D)   Records of monitoring information shall include:
      (1)   The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements;
      (2)   The individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements;
      (3)   The date(s) analyses were performed;
      (4)   The individual(s) who performed the analyses;
      (5)   The analytical techniques or methods used; and
      (6)   The results of such analyses.
   (E)   Monitoring must be conducted according to test procedures approved
under 40 C.F.R., part 136, unless other test procedures have been specified in
the permit.
   (F)   A grab sample must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organics unless otherwise specified in the
permit. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained
through flow proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. As
specified in the user's permit, the Public Works Director may permit 24-hour
time composite sampling where flow proportioned composite sampling for any user
that demonstrates flow proportional sampling is infeasible.
   (G)   All samples shall be analyzed in conformance with A.R.S. § 36-495
environmental laboratories requirements.
   (H)   A categorical or significant industrial user who independently
monitors any pollutant more frequently than as conducted by the town and
required and specified by the Public Works Director, shall include the results
of this monitoring in the required reports due in June and December.
   (I)   If sampling performed by categorical and significant industrial users
indicates a violation, the user shall notify the Public Works Director within
24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Public Works Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation
unless the town performs sampling at the user between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results
of this sampling.

Director as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions
to the permitted facility. Notice is required only when:
      (1)   The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of
the criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source, the term "new
source" means any building, structure, facility, or installation from which
there is or may be a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which
commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under
Section 307(c) of the Clean Water Act which will be applicable to such source
if such standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section;
or
      (2)   Any anticipated facility expansions, production increases, or
process modifications which will result in new, different or increased
discharges of pollutants must be reported by submission of a new permit
application or, if such changes will not violate the discharge limitations
specified in the permit, by notice to the town. Following such notice, the
permit may be modified to specify and limit any pollutants not previously
limited or change existing limits or other requirements. Approval must be
obtained prior to any new discharges. The user shall allow 90 days for review.
   (B)   Anticipated noncompliance. The user shall give advance notice to the
Public Works Director of any planned changes in the permitted facility or
activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.
   (C)   Self-monitoring reports. Monitoring results shall be reported at the
intervals specified in the permit.
      (1)   Monitoring results must be reported each month;
      (2)   If the user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by
the permit, using test procedures approved under 40 C.F.R., part 136 or as
specified in the permit, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the calculation and reporting of the data;
      (3)   Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of
measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean;
      (4)   The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the
categorical standard or Public Works Director) of regulated pollutants in the
discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations.
   (D)   Compliance schedules. Reports of compliance or noncompliance with, or
any progress reports on, interim final requirements contained in any compliance
schedule of the permit shall be submitted no later than 14 days following each
schedule date.
   (E)   Intermittent discharge monitoring. If the discharge is intermittent
rather than continuous, then, on the first day of each such intermittent
discharge, the user shall monitor and record data for all the characteristics
listed in the monitoring requirements, after which the frequencies of analysis
listed in the monitoring requirements shall apply for the duration of each such
intermittent discharge. In no event shall the user be required to monitor and
record data more often than twice the frequencies listed in the monitoring
requirements.

§ 152.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to promote the educational,
cultural, economic and general welfare of the community and to ensure the
harmonious growth and development of the municipality by encouraging the
preservation of historic places and structures through the designation of sites
and districts of historical significance. It is not intended that the
designation of a site or a district as historic should modify uses permitted in
existing zones, but rather that the designation of a historic site or a
historic district be superimposed over existing zones to encourage the
retention of early structures and objects in active use and in substantially
their historic appearance, setting and placement. It is intended that the
renovation of a historic site shall preserve its distinguishing historic
qualities or character and that new structures erected within a historic
district or the renovation of an existing structure within a historic district
shall harmonize with the general character or ambiance of existing structures
in the district in order to preserve the architectural heritage of the district
and to promote the historical significance of the site or district among
residents and visitors to the community.

the exterior surface of any part of an existing building, structure or object.
   CONCENTRATION. A group of sites, buildings, structures or objects, in
proximity, which contribute to a pattern or sense of time and place, with
relatively few instructions (i.e., structures which detract from an area's
sense of time and place).
   CONTINUITY. The state or quality of being in order, forming a continuous or
connected whole.
   LINKAGE. The association or correlation of two or more sites, buildings,
structures or objects because of location, setting and similarity of time,
place and/or other characteristics.
   ORDINARY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR. Regular, customary or usual care,
reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building, structure or
object, for the purpose of preserving the property and maintaining it in safe
and sanitary condition.

shall be reviewed by staff for accuracy, sufficiency, and compliance with land
use regulations. A public hearing on the application shall be held by the
Historic Preservation Commission. Staff and the Historic Preservation
Commission shall forward a report and recommendations on the application to the
Town Council.
   (B)   The Mayor and Council shall consider whether to designate by ordinance
a building, structure or object as a historic site or an area as a historic

any changes to the exterior of a historic site or of any structure within a
historic district shall apply to the Building Official for a permit therefor.
   (C)   In addition to the forms, plans and fees as may be required by the
Building Code or the Building Official for a building permit for a structure
outside a historic district, any application to construct, renovate, demolish,
remove or otherwise to make any changes to the exterior of a historic site or
of any structure within a district shall include photographs, plans,
descriptions, dimensions, drawings, sketches or other information sufficient to
allow meaningful review and determination of the ultimate appearance and the
impact of the proposed project. The Historic Preservation Commission shall
adopt requirements for any application, which requirements shall be filed with
the Town Clerk and the Building Official and made available there for public
inspection. Professional quality plans, renderings or materials shall not be
required.
   (D)   Following determination by the Building Official that an application
meets the requirements of the Building Code or other applicable code for
issuance of a permit outside a historic district or of the code as modified for
historic districts or sites, the Building Official shall within one working day
deliver the application and the additional materials to the Chairperson or, if
the Chairperson is not available, to the Secretary of the Historic Preservation
Commission. The Commission shall consider the application at a public meeting
to be held within 14 days of its receipt by the Chairperson or the Secretary.
   (E)   Written notice of the meeting shall be delivered or mailed by the
Secretary of the Commission at least to the applicant, no later than ten days
before the meeting. The Commission shall establish rules and procedures
governing notice to owners of record of adjacent surrounding properties.
   (F)   At the meeting, the Commission shall review the application and the
additional materials submitted with it and discuss the project with the
applicant and any others attending to determine whether the project is
appropriate and in keeping with the historic character of the site and/or
district.
   (G)   In determining whether to approve an application, the Commission shall
follow the United States Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for
Rehabilitation," appearing in 36 C.F.R. part 67. The Commission may also
formulate additional standards and guidelines not inconsistent with those of
the Secretary of the Interior. Copies of these standards and guidelines shall
be on file with the Town Clerk and the Building Official and made available
there for public inspection.
   (H)   The Commission shall act upon the application by approving it or
denying it, at a public meeting held for that purpose, and shall specify the
reason(s). The Commission shall transmit a copy of its decision, by mail, to
the applicant. Failure of the Commission to meet and make a decision on any
application submitted within 20 days of receipt of the application by the
Chairperson or Secretary shall constitute approval of the application unless
the applicant consents in writing to an extension.
   (I)   When the Commission approves an application, a permit for the project
shall be issued. In the event an application is denied by the Commission, no
permit shall be issued for the project.
   (J)   Except for a decision denying an application for demolition or
removal, the decision of the Commission shall be final and conclusive.
   (K)   A decision of the Commission denying an application for demolition or
removal of a building, structure or object shall delay issuance of the permit
for 120 days after the effective date of the decision. During that 120-day
period, the Commission shall endeavor to convince the applicant to preserve the
building, structure or object, or the Commission shall try to find someone to
purchase it for a price and upon terms agreeable to the applicant; and the
buyer must also agree to preserve it for at least five years. If, within the
120-day period, the Commission is unable either to so convince the applicant or
to find a buyer, the permit shall be issued at the request of the applicant at
any time, 121 days or more after the effective date of the decision.
   (L)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition of any feature which the
Building Official shall certify is required by the public safety because of an
unsafe or dangerous condition.
   (M)   Where the provisions of this section are in conflict with another
section of the zoning ordinance, the provisions of this section shall govern.
(1996 Code, § 15.32.070) (Ord. 87-05-004, passed - -)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to violate, or cause the

violating any of the provisions in this chapter shall be guilty of a Class 1
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not to

153.99   Penalty
§ 153.01 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   The Town of Gila Bend elects not to assume the responsibility of
floodplain management from the Flood Control District of Maricopa County as
provided for in A.R.S. §§ 48-3609 and 48-3610. The Town Manager, or his/her
designee, is designated as the NFIP Floodplain Administrator for the town, is
responsible for coordinating with the Flood Control District of Maricopa
County, and will serve as the community point of contact on NFIP issues for
county, state and Federal officials.
   (B)   Those public records entitled "Flood Insurance Study for Maricopa
County, Arizona and" dated November 4, 2015 with accompanying FIRMs dated
November 4, 2015, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, copies of
which shall be kept on file in the office of the Town Clerk, are hereby adopted
by reference as the basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas in
the Town of Gila Bend. The special flood hazard areas documented in the FIS and
FIRMs are the minimum area of applicability of the floodplain management
regulations and may be supplemented by studies for other areas as allowed in
the regulations.
   (C)   That public record designated as the "Floodplain Regulation of
Maricopa County," dated January 17, 2018, and all subsequent amendments and/or
revisions, copies of which shall be kept on file in the office of the Town
Clerk, is hereby adopted as the legal basis for implementing floodplain
management in this community.
(Ord. 20-01, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 153.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   As provided for by A.R.S. § 48-3613(D) this state, a political
subdivision or a person who may be damaged or has been damaged as a result of
the unauthorized diversion, retardation or obstruction of a watercourse, or the
flood control district in the case of any violation of this regulation, has the
right to commence, maintain and prosecute any appropriate action or pursue any
remedy to enjoin, abate or otherwise prevent any person from violating or
continuing to violate this regulation. If a person is found by the court to be
in violation of this regulation, the court shall require the violator to either
comply with this regulation, if authorized by the Board, or remove the
obstruction and restore the watercourse to its original state. The court may
also award such monetary damages as are appropriate to the injured parties
resulting from the violation including reasonable costs and attorney fees.
   (B)   Every new structure, building, fill, excavation, or development
located or maintained in a floodplain since August 8, 1973 in violation of
A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 21, Article 1 or this regulation and without written
authorization is a public nuisance per se and may be abated, prevented or
restrained by action of the state or any of its political subdivisions.
   (C)   It is unlawful for a person to divert, retard or obstruct the flow of
waters in a watercourse if it creates a hazard to life or property without
securing written authorization of the Board of Directors, Board of Review or
the Floodplain Administrator as required by this regulation. Where the
watercourse is a delineated floodplain, it is unlawful to excavate or build any
structure affecting the flow of waters without securing written authorization
from the District. A person who violates A.R.S. § 48-3615(A) is guilty of a
Class 2 Misdemeanor.
   (D)   General penalties. Section
10.99 of the Gila Bend Town Code shall also apply to this chapter.
