them with the proposed purchase or sale, either electronically or via mail.
Invitations sent to the vendors on the bidders' list shall be limited to
commodities that are similar in character and ordinarily handled by the trade
group to which the invitations are sent.

State Law.
   (E)   Bid acceptance and bid evaluation. Bids shall be unconditionally

withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes,
shall be supported by a written determination made by the Chief Procurement
Officer.
   (G)   Award. The contract shall be awarded, with reasonable promptness by
appropriate written notice, to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder

Chapter 23.

(Ord. 2018-016, passed 12-13-18; Am. Res. 2025-043, passed 6-12-25)
§ 40.03 CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER (CHRO).
   (A)   The CHRO is the employee charged with the responsibility of managing
the Human Resources Department and has the primary responsibility of
administering and carrying into effect the Personnel Rules and Regulations as

§ 40.04 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (EEO).
   (A)   The city provides equal employment opportunity and complies with the
principles of affirmative action regarding employment practices of protected
classes. EEO is consistent with the basic merit system principle that all
persons be afforded equal opportunity solely on the basis of job-related
criteria, and all employment decisions will be made on the basis of merit, in
conformity with EEO principles. The city considers a violation of this policy
to constitute misconduct that undermines the integrity of the employment
relationship.

without regard to race, color, sex (to include lesbian, gay, bi-sexual,
ortransgendered (LGBT) and pregnancy), age, religion, national origin,
disability, marital status, veteran status or genetic information except where
one of these is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). A BFOQ is
narrowly defined and is a qualification that relates to an essential job duty
and is considered necessary for operation of the business and is necessary to
perform the job safely and efficiently or the essence of the business would be
undermined by hiring members of a given class. The Chief Human Resources
Officer is the person that is authorized to approve a BFOQ. The city will carry
out all activity in compliance with its EEO policy and alt laws governing
nondiscrimination. These employment activities include but are not limited to:
recruiting, hiring, promotion, disciplinary action, termination, layoff,
recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.
(Ord. 2018-016, passed 12-13-18)
§ 40.05 CODE OF ETHICS FOR ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Declaration of policy.
      (1)   The City Council finds and declares that the proper function of
democratic government requires that elected public officials, appointed
officials, and employees be independent, impartial, and responsible to the
people; that government decisions and policy be made within the proper channels
of the government structure; that public office not be used for personal gain;
and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government.
      (2)   Although this section is necessary to identify minimum standards
below which a public servant’s conduct should not fall, it is understood that a
healthy ethical environment for the provision of public service cannot be
achieved or maintained by mere adherence to minimum standards. The principal
policy which forms the foundation of this section is to encourage internal
commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports
integrity with pride and enthusiasm without fear of retribution.
      (3)   Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the
public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure
for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be
encouraged and suitably rewarded; and that unethical behavior be discouraged
and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair. In
recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials and
employees is adopted.
   (B)   Applicability. This section shall apply to all PUBLIC SERVANTS, hereby
defined as any member of the City Council or of any city agency, board,
commission, committee, or other voting body, and any agent, department head,
employee, official, supervisor, volunteer, or other person, whether elected or
appointed or legally authorized by contract or in any other manner to act in
any capacity under the authority of the city.
   (C)   Informing affected persons. All public servants of the city shall be
provided a copy of Ord. 4371 and be required to sign a receipt thereof. Once an
individual has been elected, appointed or employed by the city, he or she shall
receive a copy of Ord. 4371 and a memo to be signed in acknowledgment of
receipt. They will also be provided with a sheet citing relevant sections of
Arizona Revised Statutes regarding ethics and the penalties for their
violation.
   (D)   Responsibilities and duties. Public servants of the city are agents of
public purpose and serve for the benefit of the public. They are bound to
uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State
of Arizona; to carry out impartially all the laws of the nation, state and
municipality and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to
observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to
discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal
considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary
concern.
      (1)   No public servant shall act, or create the appearance of acting, on
behalf of the city by making any policy statement, or by promising to authorize
or to prevent any future official action of any nature, when such public
servant is not authorized to make such a statement.
      (2)   No public servant shall falsely represent his or her personal
opinion to be the official position of the city, and no public servant shall
falsely represent his or her personal opinion to be the official position of
any board and city administrators. This subsection shall not apply to
statements of elected officials made in the course of fulfilling the
responsibilities of their office or running for election to office, nor shall
it apply to the professional opinions of city officers or employees rendered in
the course of performing their duties, provided that such opinions are clearly
identified as professional opinions.
      (3)   No public servant shall use or attempt to use their official
positions improperly to unreasonably request, grant, or obtain in any manner
any unlawful or unwarranted privileges, advantages, benefits or exemptions for
themselves, or others, and no public servant shall use, or attempt to use,
their positions to avoid the consequences of illegal acts for any person;
nothing in this provision shall be construed to prohibit or discourage any
public servant from performing any official duty or action zealously and
enthusiastically.
      (4)   All public servants have a fiduciary duty to use city fiscal and
human resources in a manner which advances the public interest, and to refrain
from using city resources for their personal benefit; therefore, public
servants are prohibited from using city resources in any manner which violates
any applicable law or policy, and are expressly prohibited from using city
resources to obtain any personal benefit; accordingly, public servants shall
act responsibly in the care and use of city resources, and shall not
negligently or intentionally abuse, damage, lose, misappropriate, misplace,
misuse, steal, or waste any city resources, including, but not limited to:
business cards, books, computers, copy machines, electricity, equipment,
facilities, fax lines, internet, inventory, money, official stationery, office
space, personnel, postage, records, supplies, telephones, time tools,
typewriters, uniforms, and vehicles.

vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit,
except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided
as municipal policy for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of
official business.
      (3)   The city does not discriminate on the basis of race, color,
national origin, sex, religion or age in employment of the provisions of
services, and shall comply with all applicable federal and state civil rights
and employment laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act.

and sworn, alleging a violation of this section.

      (3)   No more than ten business days after the submission of the alleged
violation, the City Clerk shall send to the complainants(s) via certified mail
an acknowledgment of receipt of the complaint, and simultaneously forward the
complaint to the City Manager and the City Attorney.
      (4)   If the complaint is lodged against an employee in the classified
service or an appointed official:
         (a)   The City Attorney shall provide the City Manager with a
preliminary analysis of the complaint no later than 30 days from the receipt of
the complaint by the City Attorney.
         (b)   Upon receipt of the preliminary analysis, the City Manager, in
consultation with the City Attorney, shall decide whether further investigation

gravity of the offense. The City Council is permitted to take any action which
it is otherwise lawfully permitted to take, including but not limited to, any
one or a combination of the following which the City Council deems appropriate
under the circumstances: public admonition, public reprimand, suspension,
demotion, forfeiture of or removal from office, termination from employment, a
cease and desist order, which must be enforced by a court of competent
jurisdiction, and a fine up to the maximum amount permitted by law.
   (J)   Severability. If any provision of this section is held by any court or
by any federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid with any
federal or state law now or hereinafter in effect, or is held by such court or
agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any
such law, such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any
other provision of this section.

§ 52.04 PREPARATION OF SOLID WASTE FOR COLLECTION.
   All solid waste shall be prepared for collection or disposed of as follows:
   (A)   Solid Waste. The City shall furnish containers to its commercial and
residential customers, for the accumulation, storage, and collection of all
solid waste. Customers will make every effort to keep such containers in good
repair and in a sanitary condition. Lost containers or containers found to be
no longer serviceable through disrepair or maintained in an unsanitary
condition, will be replaced by the City and subject to the appropriate
container replacement fees. All refuse must be bagged and tied, and placed in a
container to be acceptable for collection to prevent the attraction of any
flies or vectors. The City reserves the right to remove containers due to
violations of this Chapter that result in endangerment to public health.
   (B)   Bulky Refuse. Bulky refuse and furniture shall be placed at the front
curb, unless otherwise designated by the Public Works Department, tied in
bundles or placed in boxes by the customer. Boxes and bundles shall not exceed
four (4) square feet by four (4) square feet deep in measurement and not to
exceed sixty (60) pounds in weight. If the loads are not bundled or contained,
the City will assess appropriate collection fees and disposal fees for program
cost recovery. The Director of Public Works or designee, may provide bulky item
service to any residential or commercial customer, subject to the appropriate
solid waste management service fees, if in the Director of Public Works’ or
designee’s judgment, a health or safety hazard exists, in a public right-of-
way.
   (C)   Green Waste. Green waste cut for disposal shall be bundled by the
customer. Bundles must be tied securely by heavy twine or rope, with each
bundle not to exceed four square feet by four square feet deep and not to
exceed a weight of sixty (60) pounds. When bundles do not meet these
requirements, charges for whatever method is necessary to collect the brush
will be assessed to the property owner. Brush trimmed by contractors must be
removed by the contractors. Brush may be placed in regular refuse containers
but must readily fall out when emptied and shall not extend over the top edge
of the container or be compacted or wedged in a manner which would impede
collection. Upon notification by the Public Works Department, residents shall
have ten days to remove brush that does not conform to the requirements of this
Subsection. Should the resident fail to comply, the City will remove the brush
and charge the customer.
   (D)   Appliances and Small Household Equipment. The City will collect
discarded appliances from dwelling premises, subject to the appropriate solid
waste management service fees, and provided that two (2) persons can readily
lift into a collection vehicle. The customer shall remove or cause to be
removed all other appliances, vehicles, or equipment classified as solid waste
from their premises or the public right-of-way. Doors shall be removed from
appliances or secured in such a way no one can enter. Appliances containing
Freon shall be serviced by a licensed vendor, certifying that all Freon has
been removed from the appliance, in accordance with state regulations.
   (E)   Dangerous and Hazardous Waste. The placement of dangerous and
hazardous waste in solid waste containers is prohibited. No one shall collect,
cause to be collected, place, or cause to be placed any dangerous or hazardous
waste or similar materials from or in any container or from or upon any public
or private property except as specifically permitted by the Arizona Department
of Environmental Quality or the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. Oil
shall be placed in a separate container, not inside refuse containers, and
disposed of according to law. Sharps shall be placed inside puncture-resistant
containers and disposed of according to law.
   (F)   Cactus. All cacti shall be placed in separate sealed cardboard boxes
apart from other refuse. A cardboard box containing cactus shall be sealed and
in condition to sustain the weight of the cactus when lifted. Failure to
properly contain cactus will result in denial of service for collection.
   (G)   Soil and concrete. Waste soil, concrete, masonry blocks, sod, and
rocks shall be disposed of by the owner, tenant, or occupant of the premises
and not placed in City bins or barrels. Private hauler roll-off service is
available for this type of material.
   (H)   Ownership of Solid Waste. Solid waste will remain the property and
responsibility of the homeowner or City customer, until collected by the City,
at which time it becomes the property of the City.
   (I)   Abatement of Health Hazard. In addition to the other remedies provided
for in this Section, if the Director of Public Works or designee, determines
that a customer’s solid waste is creating a health hazard, the City may collect
the customer's containers, subject to the appropriate solid waste fees, as
often as necessary in an attempt to abate the health hazard.

reasonable steps to cure said violation and diligently continue such efforts
until said violation is cured. Licensee shall report to the city, in writing,

if deemed necessary, schedule a meeting with licensee to review the facts
associated with the notice of violation. Following the meeting, if the city
manager determines that the licensee has committed a violation, the

§ 52.32 ACTION AGAINST LICENSE VIOLATIONS - FORMAL PROCEEDINGS.
   At the City's sole discretion, a formal action for violations of this
Chapter may be commenced by the City Manager, or his or her designee, by
issuance of a citation that is substantially in the form established or
approved by the City Manager.
   (A)   If a citation is issued, it shall include relevant information about
the violator, such as full name, residence address, driver's license number (if
any), and vehicle license number (if applicable), and shall advise the person
of the violation(s) committed. The citation shall direct the person within ten
(10) calendar days to appear before the City Hearing Officer. The citation
shall further notify the person that if he or she fails to appear on or before
the date specified in the citation, a judgment by default will be entered and
the Hearing Officer may, in his discretion, impose a civil sanction not exceed
$250.00. The citation shall be served by delivering or mailing a copy to the
person, with service becoming effective either immediately upon personal
service or five (5) calendar days from the date of mailing.
   (B)   The person shall within ten (10) days of the issuance of the citation
appear in person or through his attorney before the Hearing Officer and shall
either admit or deny the allegation contained in the citation. If the person
admits the allegations, the Hearing Officer shall enter judgment against the
person and impose a civil sanction for the violation. If the person denies the
allegations, the Hearing Officer shall set the matter for hearing. At the
hearing, the proceedings shall be informal, except that testimony shall be
given under oath or affirmation. The technical rules of evidence shall not
apply, except for statutory provisions relating to privileged communications.
The City shall have the burden of proving all violations by a preponderance of
the evidence. No prehearing discovery shall be permitted except under
extraordinary circumstances as determined by the Hearing Officer. The Hearing
Officer is authorized to make such orders as may be necessary or appropriate to
fairly and efficiently determine the truth and decide the case at hand. Upon a
finding by the Hearing Officer after the conclusion of the hearing that the
person violated this Chapter, the Hearing Officer shall enter a finding of
responsibility and judgment against the person and impose a civil sanction.
Each day of violation shall be considered a separate offense, if so alleged in
the citation. If the person fails to appear at the hearing, the allegations in
the citation shall be deemed to be admitted and the Hearing Officer shall enter
judgment in favor of the City and impose a civil sanction.
   (C)   An appeal from a final judgment of the Hearing Officer may be taken
pursuant to the rules of procedure for special actions of the Arizona Supreme
Court.
   (D)   Any civil fine or judgment for civil sanctions issued pursuant to this
Chapter shall constitute a lien against the real property of the responsible
party that may be perfected by recording a copy of the fine or judgment with
the Cochise County Recorder. Any judgment for civil fines pursuant to this
Chapter may be collected as any other civil judgment.

occur. The registered owner of the parked vehicle shall be responsible for the
payment of any and all charges incurred in the removal and subsequent storage
of the vehicle, unless it is shown that the registered owner was not the legal
owner at the time of the offense, or if the registered owner proves by a
preponderance of the evidence that the city lacked probable cause to remove the
vehicle. The provisions of Arizona Revised Statutes-sections 28-4801 et seq.,

§ 95.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth the requirements for the control of pollutants
and illicit discharges that are or may be discharged to the City of Sierra
Vista Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4). The purpose of this chapter is to
enable the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws related to
stormwater management, including but not limited to, the Clean Water Act (33
U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.), the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
Regulations (40C.F.R. Part 122), the Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (AZPDES) Permit (Arizona Administrative Code R18-9-A902), and the city's
stormwater management plan.
   (B)   This Chapter includes all MS4 stormwater management programs including
construction, post-construction, and illicit discharge detection and
elimination.

   ARIZONA POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (AZPDES) STORMWATER PERMIT. A
permit issued by ADEQ to authorize the discharge of stormwater pursuant to
Arizona Administrative Code R18-9-A902, which incorporates 40 C.F.R. § 122.32.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs). Schedules of activities, prohibitions of
practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices that prevent
or reduce the discharge of pollutants into stormwater. BMPs also include
treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices that control site
runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from outdoor
storage areas.
   CLEAN WATER ACT. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended,

release of the audit to the public.
         (e)   For purposes of this Section a CERTIFIED AUDIT shall mean any
audit authenticated by one or more of the Qualified Professionals conducting
the audit pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Subsection.
   (D)   New development affected. This chapter shall apply to all new
development as herein defined and as defined in the this chapter or other city
code sections for particular public facilities or services.
      (1)   Exceptions to the application of development fees to new
development. Unless otherwise expressly noted, the fees imposed in this
chapter, except for those in effect prior to the approval of this chapter,
shall not apply in the following circumstances:
         (a)   Previously applied site plan permits and/or building permits. No
development fee shall be imposed on new development for which a fully completed
building permit application has been submitted prior to the effective date of
this chapter. If an approved site plan is required prior to obtaining a
building permit, then a fully completed site plan application must also be
completed prior to the effective date of this chapter in order to receive the
exemption. A fully completed site plan application is defined as a submittal
that meets all requirements of § 151.18 of the city's Development Code. A FULLY
COMPLETED BUILDING PERMIT APPLICATION is defined as meeting the requirements of
Section 106 (Construction Documents) of the 2003 International Building Code as
adopted by the City Council.
         (b)   Previous payment of development fees. Subject to the
requirements of §
154.05(D), no development fees for a particular public facility shall be due at
a later stage of the development permit or approval process if development fees
have been fully paid for such category of public facilities at an earlier stage
in the development permit or approval process.
         (c)   No net increase in dwelling units. No development fee shall be
imposed on any new residential development that does not add a new dwelling
unit.
         (d)   No net increase in non-residential square footage. No
development fee shall be imposed on any new non-residential development that
does not add square footage to a currently existing facility.
         (e)   Other uses. No development fee shall be imposed on a use,
development, project, structure, building, fence, sign or other activity,
whether or not a building permit is required, which does not result in an
increase in the demand for public facilities.
         (f)   Development subject to development agreements. No development
fee shall be imposed upon development projects that are the subject of a
development agreement approved and executed by the city containing provisions
in express conflict with this chapter, but only to the extent of the conflict
or inconsistency.
         (g)   Other development exempted by state law. No development fee
shall be imposed on new development that is exempted by Arizona state law,
however, the city may seek to negotiate the construction of public facilities
or the provision of services, or to negotiate the payment of Development Fees
with such entities. See A.R.S. § 9-500(18).
      (3)   Effect of payment of development fees on other applicable city land
use, zoning, platting, subdivision or development regulations.
         (a)   The payment of development fees shall not entitle the applicant
to a building permit, which shall only be issued if all other applicable land
use, zoning, planning, platting, subdivision or other related requirements,
standards and conditions have been met. Such other requirements, standards and
conditions are independent of the requirement for payment of a development fee.
         (b)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall affect, in any manner,
the permissible use of property, density/intensity of development, improvement
standards or other applicable standards or requirements of the city land
development regulations, which shall be operative and remain in full force and
effect without limitation.
      (4)   Amendments. This chapter may be amended from time to time by the
Mayor and Council; provided, however, that no such amendment shall be adopted
without a written report detailing the reasons and need for the development fee
revision nor without proper notice and public hearing as set forth herein and
in A.R.S. § 9-463.05(C).
      (5)   Effect of imposition of development fees in a community facilities
district. In calculating and imposing a development fee applicable to land in a
community facilities district established under Arizona Revised Statutes, Title
48, Chapter 4, Article 6, the city shall take into account all public
infrastructure provided by the district and capital costs paid by the district
for necessary public services and facilities and shall not assess a portion of
the development fee otherwise calculated to be due that would duplicate the
infrastructure provided by the district or the costs imposed by the district on
new development.
      (6)   Change in boundaries of the city. In the event of annexation of
unincorporated county land by the city, new development in those areas shall be
assessed the development fees in accordance with this chapter, except that the
City Manager may request a review of the fees by an outside consultant, with
resulting changes presented to the Mayor and City Council for their review and
action.
      (7)   Time Limit. Development impact fees collected after July 1, 2012
shall be used within ten years of the date upon which they were collected for
all Categories of Necessary Public Services except for Water and Wastewater
Facilities. For Water Facilities or Wastewater Facilities collected after July
1, 2012, development impact fees must be used within 15 years of the date upon
which they were collected.

2012- 003, passed 5-10-12)
§ 154.05 PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION, CALCULATION AND COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT
FEES.
   (A)   In general. The city shall calculate the development fees due and
owing for any applicant at the time of the issuance of a building permit. The
applicant shall pay the development fees prior to and as a condition of the
issuance of a building permit. The city's actions established in this section
are to be performed by the Director of the city's Community Development
Department or equivalent, or his or her designee, unless specifically stated
otherwise.
   (B)   Calculation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the city
shall determine:
         (a)   Whether the permit is for a residential or non-residential use;
         (b)   The specific category (type) of residential or non-residential
development, if applicable;
         (c)   If residential, the number of new dwelling units, and;
         (d)   If non-residential, the number of new or additional square
footage of gross floor area (rounded up to the nearest square foot) and the
proposed use of the facility.
      (2)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit relating to an
existing facility, the city shall determine whether the permit will result in a
change in use. in such cases, the development fee due shall be based only on
the incremental increase in the development fee(s) for the additional public
facilities needed to accommodate the change in use.
      (3)   After making the determinations in this paragraph, the city shall
calculate the total demand for the public facility added by the new development
for each public facility category for which a development fee is being imposed
and calculate the applicable total development fee by multiplying the demand
added by the new development by the amount of the applicable development fee
per unit of development, incorporating any applicable offset if set forth in
the particular development fee calculation methodology.
      (4)   If the type of land use proposed for new development is not
expressly listed in the particular development fee schedule, the city shall, at
its option and in its discretion, determine the basis used to calculate the
development fee(s) by:
         (a)   Identifying the most similar land use type listed and calculate
the development fee based on the development fee for that land use; or
         (b)   Identifying the broader land use category within which the
specified land use would apply and calculate the development fee based on the
development fee for that land use category; or
         (c)   Reference to an independent impact analysis for development fee
calculation. If this option is chosen, the following shall apply:
            1.   The applicant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for
preparing the independent impact analysis, which shall be reviewed for approval
by the Director of Community Development Department, the Finance Manager, the
City Engineer, and the City Manager prior to the city's notification pursuant
to division (B)(4)(c)3. below. The city may, at the request of the applicant,
have the independent impact analysis prepared, provided that all costs for said
analysis are paid in advance of completion of the study.
            2.   The independent impact analysis shall measure the impact that
the proposed new development will have on the particular public facility at
issue, and shall be based on the same methodologies used in the development fee
calculation methodology report, and shall be supported by professionally
acceptable data and assumptions.
            3.   After review of the independent impact analysis submitted by
the applicant, the Director of Community Development shall accept or reject the
analysis and provide written notice to the applicant of its decision within 30
days of the submission of the completed independent impact analysis. If the
independent impact analysis is rejected, the written notice shall provide an
explanation of the insufficiencies of the analysis.
            4.   The final decision of the Director of Community Development
may be appealed pursuant this chapter.
      (5)   In the event that the Director of Community Development is required
to determine the proper classification of a proposed new development pursuant
to division (4)(a) or (b) above, the director's determination must be based on
a generally-accepted land use classification system (e.g., the North American
Industry Classification System, the Land-Based Classification Standards (APA),
and/or ITE's Trip Generation Manual) and the methodology report.
      (6)   An applicant may request a non-binding estimate of development fees
due for a particular new development at any time by filing a written request to
the Director of the Community Development Department. The applicant must
acknowledge that the estimate may be subject to change when a formal
application for a building permit for new development is made. Such non-binding
estimate is solely for the benefit and convenience of the prospective applicant
and shall in no way bind the city nor preclude it from making amendments or
revisions to any provisions of this chapter, the specific development fees or
the development fee schedules.
      (7)   The calculation of development fees due from a multiple-use new
development shall be based upon the aggregated demand for each public facility
generated by each land use type in the new development.
      (8)   The calculation of development fees due from a phased new
development shall be based upon the demand generated by each specific land use
within the phase of development for which a separate building permit is
requested.
      (9)   Development fees shall be calculated based on the development fee
amount in effect at the time of application for a building permit.
   (C)   Offsets. The City Manager, or his or her designee, shall perform the
actions of the city in accordance with this division unless specifically stated
otherwise.
      (1)   Offsets against the amount of a development fee due from a new
development shall be provided for, among other things, contributions made in
cash, or by dedication of land (if accepted or required by the city) or by
actual construction of all or part of a public facility by the affected
property owner for public facilities meeting or exceeding the demand generated
by the new development and the contribution is determined by the city to be a
reasonable substitute for the city's cost of public facilities which are
included in the particular development fee calculation methodology.
      (2)   The amount of the excess contribution shall be determined by the
city upon its receipt of a written application requesting an offset; provided,
however, that:
         (a)   The city will make no reimbursement for excess contributions
unless and until the particular public facility fund has sufficient revenue to
make the reimbursement without jeopardizing the continuity of the city's
capital improvements program, and;
         (b)   The excess contribution may not be transferred or credited to
any other type of development fees calculated to be due from that development
for other type of public facilities. The determination of the eligibility for
and the amount of the credit shall be made by the city. If the applicant
contends that any aspect of the city's decision constitutes an abuse of
discretion, the applicant shall be entitled to appeal pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   No offset shall be allowed unless the city has approved the
contribution or expenditure before it is or was made.
      (4)   Offsets for dedication of land or provision of public facilities
shall be applicable only as to development fees imposed for the same types of
public facilities that are proposed to be dedicated or provided. Even if the
value of the dedication of land or provision of a public facility exceeds the
development fee due for the type of public facility, the excess value may not
be transferred to development fees calculated to be due from the applicant for
other types of public facilities for which development fees may be imposed.
Offsets may, however, be transferred to the same applicant or to other
applicants for new development that are proposed within the final approved
platted area of the same development and for the same type of public facility.
   (D)   Collection. The city shall collect all applicable development fees at
the time of issuance of a building permit and shall issue a receipt to the
applicant for such payment unless:
      (1)   The applicant is determined to be entitled to a full offset; or
      (2)   The applicant has been determined to be not subject to the payment
of a development fee; or
      (3)   The applicant has filed an appeal protesting the imposition or
calculation of the development fee and a bond or other surety in the amount of
the development fee, as calculated by the city and approved by the Director of
Community Development and City Attorney, has been posted with the city. The
city shall collect a development fee at the time of issuance of a building
permit even if development fees were paid by the applicant at an earlier time
in the development permit or approval process, if the amount of the development
fees have increased since such prior approval. In such case, the applicant
shall only be liable for the difference between the development fees paid
earlier and those in effect at the time of issuance of the subsequent building
permit.
   (E)   Establishment of development fee accounts; appropriation of
development fee funds; and refunds.
      (1)   Development fee accounts. A development fee account shall be
established by the city for each category of public facilities for which
development fees are imposed. Such account shall clearly identify the category,
account, or fund for which the development fee has been imposed. All
development fees collected by the city shall be deposited into the appropriate
development fee account or sub-account, which shall be interest bearing. All
interest earned on monies deposited to such account shall be credited to and
shall be considered funds of the account. The funds of each such account shall
be capable of being accounted for separately from all other city funds, over
time. The city shall establish and implement necessary accounting controls to
ensure that the development fee funds are properly deposited, accounted for and
appropriated in accordance with this chapter, A.R.S. § 9-463.05 and any other
applicable legal requirements.
      (2)   Appropriation of development fee funds.
         (a)   In general. Development fee funds may be appropriated for public
facilities, for public facility expenditures as defined herein and for the
payment of principal, interest and other financing costs on contracts, bonds,
notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city or other
applicable local governmental entities to finance such public facilities and
public facility expenditures. All appropriations from development fee accounts

funds are or will be available from the appropriate development fee account for
the particular public facility.
      (4)   Refunds.
         (a)   Eligibility for refund.

prior to construction shall be eligible to apply for a refund of development
fees paid.

of a certificate of occupancy, shall be eligible for a refund if, and only if,
the uncompleted building is completely demolished pursuant to a proper
demolition permit.
            4.   Change of use within five years. An applicant may request a
refund of a portion of the development fees collected at the time of building
permit issuance, if the development has changed its use to one in a category in
which fees are less, or the development can be documented as less intense. In
such instance, the applicant must present the appropriate study documenting the
change in trip reduction that corresponds to calculations used in the
methodology report.
            5.   A 5% administrative fee, but not to exceed $200, shall be
deducted from the amount of any refund granted and shall be retained by the

administrative expenses associated with the processing of a refund application.
            6.   Refunds shall be made only to the current owner of property on
which the new development was proposed or occurred. If more than one owner owns
property which paid the development fees the request for refunds shall contain
a copy of the conveyance documents wherein the proportionate ownership shares
are set forth and the refunds shall be issues in accordance with the ownership
shares of the conveyance documents. Any party obtaining a refund from the city
shall confirm current ownership and entitlement to this refund under oath and

complete application for a refund, the city shall review the application and
documentary evidence submitted by the applicant as well as such other
information and evidence as may be deemed relevant, and make a determination as
to whether a refund is due. Refunds by direct payment shall be made following
an affirmative determination by the city.

prior to completion shall be made in or on forms provided by the city and shall

category and receipts evidencing such payments, and;
            3.   Documentation evidencing the expiration or revocation of the
building permit or approval of demolition of the structure pursuant to a valid
city-issued demolition permit. Failure to apply for a refund within 60 days
following expiration or revocation of the building permit or demolition of the
structure shall constitute a waiver of entitlement to a refund. No interest
shall be paid by the city in calculating the amount of any refunds.

appropriate development fees collected from the applicant within the time
limits established herein shall be made in or on forms provided by the city and

direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other development fees due
for the same category of public facilities for new development on the same
property, or by other means subject to agreement with the property owner.

§ 155.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish a program to
reduce the amount of deteriorating real property located within the city, in
particular, real property suffering from blight or creating nuisances caused by
the lack of adequate maintenance. The program includes a property registration
requirement designed to assist in accomplishing the intent and purpose of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2015-009, passed 12-17-15)

the mortgage has breached or is in default of a repayment or other obligation
in connection with that mortgage and has been notified by the mortgagee.
      (2)   “Foreclosure” means the process by which real property placed as
security for the repayment of a loan is to be sold to satisfy the debt
concerning which the borrower has defaulted and includes proceedings under
deeds of trust.
      (3)   “Mortgage” means a first mortgage or other first-priority security
interest in real property that is placed as security for the repayment of a
loan, and includes a first deed of trust.
      (4)   “Mortgagee” means any person or firm who holds a first-priority
mortgage or other first-priority security interest in real property to secure a
loan, whether as the mortgagee of a mortgage or the beneficiary of a deed of
trust.

default regarding that mortgage has occurred and either:
         a.   A notice of breach or notice of default and election to sell has
been provided to the obligor and has been recorded in the Cochise County

Section 151.03.008 Appeals of Dedications or Exactions
Title 9, A.R.S. § 9-500.12 specifies the terms under which a property owner is
entitled to appeal from dedications or exactions required as a condition of the
use, improvement or development of property.
If a property owner requests, and an administrative agency or official of the
City makes a final determination that grants an approval for the use,
improvement, or development of real property subject to the requirement of a
dedication or exaction as a condition of granting approval, the property owner
may appeal the required dedication or exaction to the hearing officer. The City
shall notify the property owner that the property owner has the right to appeal
the dedication or exaction pursuant to this section and shall provide a
description of the appeal procedure. The City shall not request the property
owner to waive the right of appeal or trial de novo at anytime during the
consideration of the property owner's request.
This section does not apply to a dedication or exaction required in a
legislative act of the City that does not give discretion to an administrative
agency or official to determine the nature or extent of the dedication or
exaction.
A.   Procedure. The following procedures apply to appeals:
   The appeal shall be in writing and filed with or mailed to the Hearing
Officer within 30 days of the administrative decision requiring dedication or
exaction.
B.   Hearings. Hearings shall be scheduled within 30 days of receipt by the
Hearing Officer. Ten days notice shall be given to the aggrieved party unless
the aggrieved party indicates to the Hearing Officer that shorter notice is
acceptable. The Hearing Officer shall render a decision within five working
days after the appeal is heard. The Hearing Officer may affirm the dedication
or exaction, modify it, or delete the requirements.
   At the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
Parties to an appeal shall have the right to present their case by oral or
documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross
examination of witnesses as may be required for full, true disclosure of the
facts; provided that:
   1.   The submission of documentary evidence shall not, by reason of its
written form, prejudice the interest of any party; and
   2.   The Hearing Officer shall, as a matter of policy, provide for exclusion
of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence and, in furtherance of
this policy, may limit cross examination.
   The burden of proof shall rest with the city that the following conditions
apply:
   1.   The dedication or exaction must bear an essential nexus between the
requirement and a legitimate governmental interest; and
   2.   The proposed dedication or exaction is roughly proportional to the
impact or use, improvement or development.
C.   Stay of Proceedings. Any appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
action appealed from, unless the City certifies to the Hearing Officer after
the notice of appeal is filed with him that, by reason of facts stated in this
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Hearing Officer or by a court of
record in application or notice to the City and due cause shown.

Section 151.03.009 Appeals from the Hearing Officer
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Hearing Officer may, at any time
within 30 days after the Hearing Officer has rendered a decision, file a
complaint for special action in the superior court to review the Hearing
Officer’s decision. Filing of the complaint does not stay proceedings on the
decision sought to be reviewed, but the court may, on application, grant a stay
and, on final hearing, may affirm or reverse or modify, in whole or in part,
the decision reviewed.

Section 151.04.005 Administrative Modification of Dimensional Standards
A.   Applicability 
   1.   In accordance with the provisions of this Section, staff may modify a
required building setback in cases where the following conditions apply:
      a.   For properties located outside the Infill Incentive District Area:
         (1)   The subject property contains an existing single-family dwelling
unit; and
         (2)   The modified setback results in a building setback of no less
than five feet from a rear or side property line unless the subject property
abuts a platted alleyway or dedicated drainageway in which case a modified
setback shall provide no less than one-foot of building setback from a rear or
side property line that abuts a platted alleyway or dedicated drainageway.
      b.   For properties located inside of an Infill Incentive District Area:
         (1)   The subject property is used or proposed to be used for
residential purposes; and
         (2)   The modified setback results in a building setback of no less
than five feet from a rear or side property line unless the subject property
abuts a platted alleyway or dedicated drainageway in which case a modified
setback shall provide no less than one-foot of building setback from a rear or
side property line that abuts a platted alleyway or dedicated drainageway.
         (3)   The modified setback results in a building setback of no less
than fifteen feet from a front lot line adjoining the primary frontage or no
less than ten feet from a front lot line adjoining the secondary frontage (on
corner lots); provided, however, no setback modification shall be granted for
that portion of a front facade containing an enclosed garage or carport.
      c.   For residentially zoned properties that adjoin a street with a
platted right-of-way that exceeds the minimum required right-of-way width for
the functional classification assigned to the street that the subject property
abuts:
         (1)   The modification to the minimum required setback results in a
reduction that is no greater than the width of the right-of-way between the
owner’s property line and the outside edge of the sidewalk. If no sidewalk
exists, the City shall determine its ultimate location based on the applicable
roadway cross section. Provided, however, no setback reduction shall be granted
for that portion of a front building facade containing an enclosed garage or
carport.
   2.   In accordance with the provisions of this Section, staff may modify the
maximum fence or wall height on properties used for residential purposes,

by a professional engineer or architect registered in the State of Arizona as
being able to support the modification in accordance with local building codes.
B.   Application. Requests shall be made on application forms provided by the
Department of Community Development.
C.   The City shall notify, by mail, the property owner(s) most affected by the
proposed request. The notice shall include a sketch plan of the site.
D.   Standards. The City shall grant a modification of the setback after these
following standards have been met:
    1.   The request shall not substantially reduce the amount of privacy that
would otherwise be enjoyed by nearby residents. This is determined by the
responses from adjacent property owners and staff observations.
   2.   Significant views of prominent land forms or parks from nearby
properties will not be obstructed any more than would occur if the request was
granted.
   3.   Traffic visibility on adjoining streets will not be adversely affected;
   4.   Drainage from proposed buildings and structures will not adversely
affect adjoining properties and public rights-of-way;
   5.   The location of proposed buildings and structures, and the activities
to be conducted therein, will not impose objectionable noise levels or odors on
adjoining properties.
   6.   The proposal will not interfere with the daily living activities or
injure the rights of adjacent property owners. This is determined by the
responses from the adjacent property owners and staff observations.
E.   Determination by the City
   1.   The City shall review all the submitted information and provide a
written response to the petitioner of the action.
   2.   The City shall approve the application if all the standards as stated
in
151.04.006.D are met. Once granted, the building permit may be issued. The
permit must be issued within 120 days of the granting of the request. Approval
of the request does not set precedent; each request is reviewed on an
individual basis.
   3.   The request shall be denied if the standards as stated in
151.04.006.D are not met. The decision shall indicate the reasons why the
request was denied.
F.   Fees. Fees for administrative modifications shall be determined according
to a schedule established by the Council.

Section 151.06.008 Communications Facilities
A.   Intent
   1.   The intent of this section is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of towers and other structures used for the provision of communication
services, including but not limited to wireless telecommunications and
associated antenna, ground equipment, and accessory structures related to
wireless telecommunications infrastructure, and to provide for the health,
safety, and general welfare of the public from:
      a.   Potential injury to citizens and damage to property from falling
towers or items falling from a tower;
      b.   Potential injury to people while playing around towers and their
appurtenant compounds;
      c.   Potential aesthetic harm to residential communities; and
      d.   Potential negative economic impacts on the scenic tourist industry.
B.   Goals
   1.   The goals of this Section are to encourage the location of towers in
nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the
community; strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible,
in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; encourage users
of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse
visual impact of the towers and antennas; establish review procedures to ensure
that applications for telecommunications facilities are acted upon within a
reasonable period of time; and enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunication services to provide such services to the community quickly,
effectively and efficiently.
C.   Definitions
   1.   Accessory Antennas: A facility that is an accessory to an existing use
or structure, and is clearly incidental to or subordinate in terms of purpose,
area and extent.
   2.   Alternative Structure: A structure that is not primarily constructed
for the purpose of supporting antennas but on which one or more antennas may be
mounted. Alternative structures include, but are not limited to, buildings,
water tanks, light stanchions, pole signs, billboards, church steeples and
electric power transmission towers.
   3.   Amateur Radio Antenna: An arrangement of wires or metal rods used in
the sending and receiving of electromagnetic waves and as authorized by the
issuance of an amateur radio license by the FCC, provided that the transmission
and reception of such electromagnetic waves is compliant with all FCC
regulations.
   4.   Ancillary Structure: Equipment, devices and structures associated with
a wireless communications facility, including but not limited to: concrete
slabs on grade, guy anchors, generators, feed lines, mounting hardware,
pedestals, electrical risers and transmission cable supports; however,
specifically excluding fencing, equipment cabinets, towers, alternative
structures, and antenna elements.
   5.   Antenna: Any exterior apparatus designed for communications through the
sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves.
   6.   Camouflage Techniques: Sometimes referred to as a concealed or stealth
facility. A tower or antenna designed to unobtrusively blend into the existing
surroundings, be disguised so as to not have the appearance of a communications
facility, or be designed or located in such a manner that the tower or antenna
is not easily discernable from surrounding properties. These types of
facilities may be attached or freestanding. Attached facilities may be
camouflaged through the use of paint to match the building or structure, and
through the use of faux windows, dormers or other architectural features that
blend in with the building or structure. Examples of freestanding facilities
include the form and shape of a tree, bell tower, steeple, clock tower, light
standard, flagpole and other techniques which serve to diminish the visual
impact of the tower or antenna.
   7.   Co-Location: The practice of installing and operating multiple antenna
systems, owned or controlled by multiple wireless service providers, and/or
radio common carrier licensees on the same tower, antenna support structure, or
alternative structure using different and separate antenna, feed lines,
equipment cabinets, generators and other radio frequency generating equipment.
   8.   Communication Facilities: is the general term used to collectively
describe all the various communication towers, antennas, networks, systems,
arrays, equipment, devices and structures defined in this Section.
   10.   Equipment Compound: The fenced area surrounding the ground-based
wireless communication facility that includes the following: the tower or
antenna support structure’s framework and ancillary structures such as
equipment necessary to operate the antenna, cabinets, shelters, pedestals,
emergency generators and other similar structures.
   11.   FAA: Federal Aviation Administration.
   12.   FCC: Federal Communications Commission.
   13.   Geographic Service Area: An area designated by a wireless provider or
operator for a new base station and antenna elements, produced in accordance
with generally accepted principles of wireless engineering.
   14.   Height: The distance measured from ground level to the ultimate
highest point on the tower or other structure, even if the highest point on the
tower or structure is the antenna.
   15.   Monopole Tower: A style of free-standing tower consisting of a single
shaft usually composed of two or more hollow sections used to conceal all feed
lines that are in turn attached to a foundation. This type of tower is designed
to support itself without the use of guy wires or other stabilization devices.
   16.   Primary Use: The predominant use of the land or structure.
   17.   Substantial Change: A modification that substantially changes the
physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the
following criteria:
      a.   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it
increases the height of the tower by more than ten (10) percent or by the
height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest
existing antenna not to exceed twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater; for
other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by
more than ten (10) percent or more than ten (10) feet, whichever is greater.
      b.   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it
involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude
from the edge of the tower more than twenty (20) feet, or more than the width
of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater;
for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to
the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by
more than six (6) feet;
      c.   For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more
than standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but
not to exceed four (4) cabinets, or for towers in the public rights-of-way and
base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the
ground if there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the
structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than
ten (10) percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground
cabinets associated with the structure. Please refer to Chapter 92, Wireless
Facilities in Public Right-of- Way, of the City Code of Ordinances for specific
development and submittal requirements for wireless facilities within the
right-of-way;
      d.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site;
      e.   It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support
structure; or
      f.   It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting
approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure
or base station equipment, provided however that this limitation does not apply
to any modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not
exceed the thresholds in paragraphs a. through d. of this definition.
   18.   Tower: Any structure designed and constructed primarily for the
purpose of supporting one (1) or more antennas, including self-supporting
lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and
television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers,
cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures and the like.

to the following minimum specifications and installation criteria.
         (1)   Fire hydrants shall be spaced at distances no greater than 500
feet for residential developments and 400 feet for commercial and industrial
developments. In cases where it is not feasible to construct hydrants to meet
the spacing requirements stated above (as determined by the Fire Chief or his
authorized representative) at least one hydrant shall be installed no greater
than 500 feet from the furthest point of any proposed new building. For
buildings equipped with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with the
IFC, the spacing between fire hydrants can be increased to 600 feet, provided
safety concerns are not compromised. The Fire Chief or his authorized designee
shall review site conditions and approve the increase in hydrant spacing. All
distances shall be measured along the centerline of streets, public ways, or
access roadways. Where the most recently adopted IFC or ADEQ requirements
conflict with this section the most restrictive shall apply.

surface of existing or proposed streets or sidewalks. Threads of all outlets
shall be National Standard Hose Threads.
         (3)   In all zoning districts, water mains supplying water to fire
hydrants shall be no less than six inches in diameter. Water mains shall be
looped and valving installed such that a single break in the water distribution
system shall not necessitate shutting from service a length of pipe no greater
than 500 feet. In cases where it is not feasible to loop the water system (as
determined by the Fire Chief or his authorized representative) water mains
supplying water to fire hydrants shall be no less than eight inches in
diameter.
      c.   If the existing water system is incapable of supplying adequate fire
flow, then there shall be provided such additional water supply as may be
necessary to provide the flow required for fire protection. Water supply may
consist of wells, reservoirs, pressure tanks, elevated tanks, water mains, or
other fixed system capable of supplying the adequate fire flow or other
measures as determined by the IFC. In determining the required fire flow for
fire protection, the standards published by the IFC, shall be used as a guide.
      d.   Fire hydrant caps shall be painted chrome yellow and color coated to
represent the gallons per minute flow as per National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA) 24.
      e.   Installation of fire hydrants shall follow the requirements of the
IFC, the NFPA, and the City of Sierra Vista Development Codes.

      b.   Engineering Bulletin 11 and all other applicable laws, rules, and
regulations of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.
      c.   Uniform Standard Specification for Public Works Construction and the
Uniform Standard Details for Public Works Construction as compiled by the
Maricopa Association of Governments.
      d.   City of Sierra Vista, Public Works Engineering Design Standards and
Drawings as compiled by the City Engineer.
   2.   Document Conflict
      In case of conflict between the referenced documents, the City Engineer
shall determine the applicable design or construction requirement. In general,
the more stringent or conservative requirement will be applied.
   3.   Engineer Required
      Any person desiring to construct public sewerage facilities and connect
to the City Water Reclamation System must employ a Professional Engineer
registered by the State of Arizona to perform sewer design and construction
services. The Professional Engineer must prepare plans and specifications for
the construction of the sewerage facilities and submit them through the
Director of Community Development for approval by the City Engineer.
Construction of sewerage facilities cannot begin until the plans and
specifications have been approved by the City Engineer and Arizona Department
of Environmental Quality and a Sewer Extension Agreement provided by the City
has been executed by the property owner constructing the sewerage facilities
and the City.
      The Professional Engineer must perform construction engineering services
to assure the sewer facilities are constructed in accordance with the approved
plans and specifications. Construction engineering services include field
surveillance of the contractors activity and inspection and testing of
construction procedures and materials. All construction engineering services
are subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. The Professional
Engineer shall submit to the City Engineer copies of all materials testing
reports and weekly inspection reports during the progress of the work.
      Upon completion of the work, the Professional Engineer shall submit to
the City Engineer "as- built" plans depicting the sewer facilities as they were
constructed, and a certification that the sewer facilities have been
constructed in substantial conformity with the plans and specifications. Upon
receipt of such plans and certifications and a determination that the sewer
facilities have been properly constructed, the City Engineer shall notify the
Department of Public Works that the sewer facilities can be accepted for
maintenance. Upon completion of the work, the contractor performing the work,
and the person causing the work to be done, shall submit to the Director of
Community Development satisfactory assurance that the sewer facilities are free
of any liens or encumbrances and are guaranteed against any defects in
materials or workmanship for a period of two years. All submittals must be made
and approved by the Director of Community Development and all required right-
of-way or easements must be provided to the Director of Community Development
before the sewer facilities can be accepted for maintenance by the City or used
by any property owner.
   4.   Special Provisions
      a.   A separate, private sewer connection to a public sewer shall be
provided for each building and for each separate ownership within a building.
Ownership of a building by a condominium association will be considered a
single ownership for the purposes of this provision. In a commercial or mixed-
use development, combined private connection may occur if an approved
maintenance agreement is put into effect where all possible parties are
obligated to participate and funding of maintenance improvements is included.
      b.   No private sewer connection will be permitted to a public sewer
larger than 10 inches in diameter without a manhole, unless approved by the
City Engineer.
      c.   All private sewer connections shall be constructed with a clean-out
and a serviceable back flow prevention valve per the Sierra Vista Engineering
Design and Construction Standards.
      d.   In conformance with ARS 40-360.22 all lateral sewer lines, in the
City right-of-way, shall be identified by installing a 14 AWG copper wire with
green type UF insulation, the full length of the lateral, secured every 10-
feet, and terminated at a clean-out riser and meter box at finish grade.
      e.   Sewer backflow devices shall be located where they will be
accessible for inspection and repair at all times and, unless continuously
exposed, shall be enclosed in a below ground pit fitted with an adequately
sized removable cover.
         The backflow device shall be located at the connection of the building
drain and the house connect service sewer line. A clean-out shall be located on
each side of, directed away from, the backflow device.
      f.   On residential installations, the backflow device pit may be omitted
provided the top of the backflow device is not deeper than four feet below
grade, the ground above the device can be readily excavated, and a clean-out
cover identifies the device location.
      g.   No private sewer connection lines will be constructed parallel to
any public right-of-way or easement lines, or otherwise be designed in an
effort to avoid a property owner's obligation to construct the minimum sewer
facility to serve the owner’s property.
      h.   Any user connected to the City wastewater system that discharges
grease or any other substance that causes or is likely to cause sewer
stoppages, as determined by the City, shall install and properly maintain a
grease interceptor or other approved pre-treatment method to prevent such
occurrences in accordance with Chapter 50 of the City Code of Ordinances and
the Public Works Engineering Standards.
      i.   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his/her expense.
      j.   When required by the Director of Public Works, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install
a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Director of Community Development. The manhole shall be installed by the
owner at his/her expense and shall be maintained by him/her so as to be safe
and accessible at all times.
F.   Financing Sewer Facilities - General
   1.   Financial Responsibilities
      The City Water Reclamation System is a user-financed, publicly owned and
operated municipal utility system called a Sewer Enterprise. A user of the
Water Reclamation System is the owner of any property where sewage is
generated, and who is required to connect to the City Water Reclamation System
in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 50, Sewers, of the City’s Code of Ordinances. Each user is responsible
for funding an equitable share of the capital assets of the system, of the
operating and maintenance costs of the system, and of any other costs or
liabilities of the system that may be incurred in the process of collecting,
transporting, treating and reusing sewage in accordance with this code.
      a.   Sewer Facilities to extend the collection and transportation system
are financed and constructed solely by a property owner and are considered to
only benefit the property owner constructing the sewer facility. No costs for
constructing Sewer Facilities are recovered because they are considered part of
the property owners' equitable share contribution to the capital assets of the
Sewer Enterprise.
      b.   Replacement & Augmentation Sewer Facilities intended to replace worn
out or poorly designed or constructed portions of the existing collection and
transportation system are financed and constructed by the Sewer Enterprise and
are considered to indirectly benefit all users of the City Water Reclamation
System. All costs for constructing Replacement Sewer Facilities are accumulated
and/or recovered from all property owners/users as monthly Capital Service
Charges. The Sewer Enterprise is required to develop a financial plan and
assess charges to fund Replacement Facilities for the collection and
transportation system.

Section 151.08.005 Surface Drainage and Storm Sewer Systems
   A.   General Provisions
      1.   Purpose
         The primary purpose of this section is to outline and define the
drainage planning and management practices necessary to mitigate potential
flooding and to provide for an orderly, controlled means of collecting,
controlling, and allowing drainage runoff to flow safely through the community.
          A secondary purpose is to allow a means to replenish groundwater
supplies by enhancing absorption of surface water. To accomplish these
purposes, the City has adopted the Surface Water Plan for the City of Sierra
Vista, prepared by (1) Simons, Li & Associates, Inc., January 1988; (2) Cochise
County Flood Control / Urban Runoff Recharge Plan - Appendix A - Hydrology and
Flood Control - Stantec Consulting Inc. April 2006; (3) the Surface Water Plan
for the City of Sierra Vista, prepared by CMG Drainage Engineering, Inc., dated
May 2023. It is recommended that all of these documents be reviewed as each
update to the SWP may address different floodplain management issues. The 1988
Simons, Li & Associates SWP focuses on regional detention basins, the 2006
Stantec Consulting, Inc. study on groundwater recharge, the 2023 CMG Drainage
Engineering, Inc. SWP on Hydrology, identification and evaluation of flood
vulnerable communities and erosion control.
         The requirements stated herein shall be adhered to and are required of
all new developments. These requirements will also be used as guidelines for
the improvement of existing developments.
      2.   Administration and Enforcement
         The administration and enforcement of this section shall be the
responsibility of the City Engineer, unless otherwise specifically assigned
herein or described in the Development Code.
      3.   Interpretation and Application
         In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions
shall be considered as minimum requirements and are subject to approval by the
City Engineer as they apply to the Development Code requirements.
         Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the provisions of this
section shall apply to any subdivision or commercial development or the
improvement of any lot or parcel, developed or undeveloped, within the City of
Sierra Vista.
         Interpretations and the implementation of the drainage concepts
described by this section are not intended to violate the regulations of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the National Flood Insurance Program
with regard to placement of new structures within the floodplain and/or
floodway encroachments or the requirements of Section
151.22.029.
      4.   Circumvention Unlawful
         It shall be unlawful for any person to change the location or
character of any watercourse, change the flow of any surface water; construct
any structure that may retard or impede the historical flow of a drainage
course; or modify the ground surface permeability in a manner that will result
in an increase in the amount of storm water flow without the written permission
of the City Engineer as allowed by this section.
         It shall be unlawful to direct and discharge storm water into a
wastewater sewerage system. A storm water drainage system shall be separate and
required whenever the storm water flow exceeds the street drainage carrying
capacity, as defined herein.
         It shall be unlawful to discharge any substance into a storm water
facility other than storm water.
B.   Responsibility for Improvement
   It is the responsibility of the developer to finance the planning, design,
and construction of all drainage improvements on site or off site, as may be
required by the City.
   1.   Dedication of Right-of-Way
      The developer shall be required to dedicate to the public sufficient
right-of-way and easements for the maintenance of the public drainage
improvements associated with the development unless otherwise directed by the
City. Adequate right-of-way or an ingress/egress easement, no less than 20 feet
wide, shall be provided by the developer to access all public drainage
improvements for maintenance and repairs. Dedicated drainageways and access
easements must be traversable by a vehicle.
   2.   Design and Construction
      Design and construction of the required public drainage improvements
shall be made in accordance with Section
151.08.002.D and the applicable requirements of this section. Inspection and
acceptance by the City for maintenance shall comply with the procedures
outlined in Section
151.08.002.G.
C.   Drainage Reports
   A drainage report shall be required for all new development, for new
development on existing sites, and subdivisions. The drainage report shall
contain all necessary calculations and information necessary to justify all
recommendations made by the study, or as directed by the City. All drainage
reports shall be prepared and stamped by a professional civil engineer,
registered in the state of Arizona and shall address all the requirements of
this section and any other requirements deemed necessary by the City Engineer.
   1.   Preliminary Drainage Reports: Preliminary drainage reports are required
to be submitted with preliminary plats. The purpose of the preliminary drainage
report is to accurately establish hydrologic conditions associated with both
the existing site conditions and the conditions upon completion of the proposed
development. Hydrologic calculations presented in the preliminary drainage
report should be considered complete. Hydraulic design components associated
with the proposed development shall be presented in conceptual terms. Hydraulic
calculations associated with collection, conveyance, and detention/retention of
stormwater are to be included in the preliminary drainage report to the extent
necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed improvements. If the
development is adjacent to a wash, the preliminary report will address the wash
hydrology, identify floodplains currently defined by FEMA and show floodplain
boundaries (as determined by FEMA or the developer’s engineer), identify any
existing or proposed erosion setback limits, discuss the wash designation
identified in the Surface Water Plan for the City of Sierra Vista, and discuss
proposed improvements in the wash at a conceptual level. At a minimum, the
preliminary drainage report shall include:
      a.   A table in the text portion of the report showing the size of the
watershed or subbasin areas.
      b.   A table in the text portion of the report showing runoff
coefficients or soil parameters.
      c.   A table in the text portion of the report showing pre-development
peak flows (10-year and 100-year, 1-hour design storms).
      d.   A table in the text portion of the report showing post-development
peak flows (including effects of storm water basins).
      e.   A map in the text portion of the report showing the locations where
storm water discharges from the site in pre-development conditions and post
development conditions.
      f.   A table in the text portion of the report showing the peak flow and
high water elevations expected in all components of collection and conveyance
systems, including storm water basins. This information may be omitted from the
preliminary drainage report but must be included in the final drainage report.
      g.   The required tables may be combined as long as the information
presented is clear and complete.
   2.   Final Drainage Reports: Final drainage reports are required to be
submitted with final plats and site plans. The purpose of the final drainage
report is to document all hydrologic and hydraulic design associated with the
development. All information presented in the preliminary drainage report shall
be revised and finalized as required and included in the final drainage report.
The final drainage report shall present complete hydrologic calculations and
complete hydraulic calculations in one bound volume. The final report may not
refer to the preliminary report for calculations or other information. The
conditions documented in the final drainage report shall match the proposed
improvements shown on the final plans.
D.   Hydrologic Methods and Design Requirements
   Hydrologic methods that may be used when determining on-site and off-site
drainage runoff shall be as follows, or as approved by the City Engineer:
   1.   Rational Method for watersheds that have a calculated time of
concentration of less than 30 minutes in the pre-development condition.
Rational Method calculations shall be based on the following parameters:
      a.   Design storms shall be the 10-year, 1-hour storm (precipitation
depth 1.65 inches) and the 100-year, 1-hour storm precipitation depth 2.48
inches. As an alternative, site specific precipitation depths from National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14, Volume 1, Version 5,
90% confidence intervals may be used.
      b.   Small area watersheds such as those modeled using the Rational
Method are assumed to experience high intensity storms (design storms) as a
result of summer thunderstorms.
      c.   Intensity-Duration–Frequency Curves from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 1,
Version 5, 90% confidence intervals.
      d.   Time of concentration (TC) as determined by either the Highway
Drainage Design Manual, ADOT, current edition or the Drainage Design Manual for
Maricopa County Arizona, Volume I, Hydrology, current edition. Minimum time of
concentration to be 10 minutes, regardless of calculation methodology.
      e.   Runoff coefficient (C value) for pre-development conditions to be
C=0.35. This C value shall apply to both the 10-year and 100-year design storm.
Landscaped areas on the developed site are to have a C value of 0.35 or
greater. Pre-development condition calculations are to assume that the entire
site is undeveloped for the purposes of storm water basin design.
      f.   Post-development C values are to be based on the values in Table
151.08.006-1. Site specific C values may calculated and included in the
drainage report along with supporting documentation.

                  (1)   C Values for pervious pavements shall be evaluated on a
case by case basis. Pervious pavements shall not be permitted for street
construction.
                  (2)   C Values for residential subdivisions shall include
estimated area occupied by the required storm water basin.
         g.   Hydrographs are to be used to analyze the performance of proposed
storm water basins. Hydrographs for these small watersheds are to be created
using the methodology described in the Standards Manual for Drainage Design and
Floodplain Management in Tucson, Arizona, Section 4.5, 1998 Revision.
Hydrograph duration is to be a minimum of 60 minutes (to match the design
storm).
         h.   Hydrographs may be routed through storm water basins using
spreadsheets, HEC- HMS or a commercial software developed for this purpose.
      2.   HEC-HMS: analysis shall be used for watersheds that have a
calculated time of concentration of greater than 30 minutes in the pre-
developed conditions. HEC-HMS calculations shall be in accordance with the
Surface Water Plan (SWP) for the City of Sierra Vista, 2023. The City of Sierra
Vista will provide preliminary HEC- HMS models for all watersheds within the
City Limits. The models may be modified as needed to create site specific
models for proposed development. Modifications shall follow the procedures in
the Surface Water Plan (SWP) for the City of Sierra Vista, 2023.
      3.   Washes Designated as FEMA Floodplains - Project specific revisions
to the hydrology calculations will not be accepted for washes currently
designated as FEMA Floodplains. The peak flows used to determine the current
100-year FEMA floodplains shall be considered accurate for the purpose of
development review. Developers wishing to revise FEMA wash hydrology must do so
by obtaining a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA.
E.   Hydraulic Methods and Design Requirements
   Hydraulic calculations shall be included in the drainage report to
demonstrate the hydraulic adequacy of all proposed drainage structures.
Calculations shall be based on the information contained in Current version of
the current version of the Drainage Design Manual, for Maricopa County,
Arizona, Hydraulics, Flood Control District of Maricopa County, or the Urban
Drainage Design Manual, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 22, Federal Highway
Administrationlatest edition. Other published manuals may be used with pre-
approval of by the City Engineer. Hydraulic design shall be subject to the
following requirements:
   1.   Drainage Structure Design Criteria. Hydraulic structures shall be
designed to collect and convey the calculated peak flow for the 100-year, 1-
hour design storm. In no case may the drainage leave the public right-of-way
for any new flows up to and including the 100-year storm event.
   2.   Freeboard. A minimum of 1 foot of free board shall be provided in all
conveyance structures except streets. This includes storm drains, ditches,
washes, channels, and storm water basins.
   3.   Grading of Commercial and Residential Lots. Lots shall be graded so
that:
      a.   All lots shall be graded toward the roadway from where the property
takes access so that positive drainage to an improved public street right-of-
way is assured during and after development. As an alternative, runoff may be
discharged to an adjacent, improved drainage easement, a dedicated drainageway,
or an alternative street, provided the drainage alternative is approved by the
City Engineer.
      b.   Cross-lot drainage will not be allowed in residential subdivisions.
      c.   Cross-lot drainage may be allowed for commercial development as long
as cross-lot drainage easements are recorded and CC&R’s are in place assigning
maintenance responsibilities.
      d.   All finish floor elevations shall be constructed a minimum of one
foot above the base flood elevation of any abutting street, drainage easement,
drainageway, detention basin, or other storm water conveyance facility.
      e.   If existing conditions make it difficult to comply with the finish
floor elevation requirements, the City may approve the construction of an
acceptable drainage control structure, designed by a professional civil
engineer, which will afford at least the same margin of safety that had the
finish floor been constructed one foot above the base flood elevation.
Alternative drainage designs are subject to review and approval of the City
Engineer.
      f.   Certification of finish floor elevations: The developer shall submit
final as-built plans in electronic format showing all lot drainage, lot
grading, building pad elevations, finish floor elevations (if available) and
the highest 100 year base flood adjacent to each lot. Final as-built plans
shall show the approved design conditions and reflect any field changes
approved by the City and the developer’s engineer. The developer’s engineer
shall certify that the final plans represent as nearly as possible the actual
field conditions of all improvements as constructed.
      g.   As-built drawings may serve as certification for lots whose pad
elevations are at least one foot above the 100-year base flood elevation.
However, when pad elevations are less than one foot above the 100-year base
flood elevation, the proposed finish floor elevation shall be certified to be a
minimum of one foot above the 100 year base flood elevation by a registered
land surveyor (RLS). The RLS shall use the City’s elevation certificate for
certification.
      h.   If the City determines that actual pad elevations are different than
the as-built drawings, an elevation certificate shall be required.
   4.   Streets. Storm runoff conveyance in streets shall be designed so that:
      a.   Flow depth shall not exceed 0.6 feet at any location during the 100-
year storm.
      b.   Flow volume shall not exceed 60 cubic feet per second (cfs) at any
location during the 100-year design storm.
      c.   Runoff from local streets shall not cross an arterial or collector
street. Runoff from local streets may be diverted to the gutters of arterial
and collector streets if it does not violate the drainage criteria for the
arterial or collector street.
      d.   Flow depth in major intersections (where both streets are collector
or above) is to be limited to 0.6 feet during the 10-year design storm. Valley
gutters may be used to convey flow across either street.
      e.   Storm drains or collection systems shall be provided in locations
where estimated flows exceed the allowable flow volume or flow depth. Nuisance
flows (very small amounts of water that wouldn’t leave the gutter pan) shall
always be conveyed on concrete surfaces (curb and gutters or valley gutters).
Nuisance flows will not be permitted on any asphalt surfaces.
      f.   A four-foot wide concrete valley gutter with no more than a 1/2"
depression shall be required at all intersections within a subdivision where
drainage is required to cross a local street. Valley gutters may be constructed
at local streets intersecting arterials or collectors as needed to properly
preserve the historical flow direction.
      g.   A four-foot concrete valley gutter shall be required along the
centerline of all new alleys that receive direct runoff discharge from private
property. The design and construction of alley improvements shall be in
accordance with Section
151.08.003.K of the Sierra Vista City Code, and be capable of conveying the
expected 100-year peak discharge entirely within the alley cross-section. The
depth of flow at the flow line shall not exceed 0.6 feet.
      h.   The existing and proposed street drainage capacity shall be
evaluated for all streets as impacted by all new developments. Lack of street
drainage capacity, as specified above, shall require the construction of storm
drains, additional detention improvements, or a combination of the two
requirements as a means of controlling street drainage.
      i.   Collection of storm water in a sump or sag condition will only be
permitted if a non- clogging, emergency overflow is provided. Storm flows must
be able to leave the sump area in an open channel such as a ditch or a street
without endangering a structure. The highest inert elevation of the emergency
overflow must be at least 1 foot below the finish floor elevation of structures
that might be affected by flow in the emergency channel.
   5.   Street Drainage Crossings. Storm water may be conveyed across streets
using culverts or dip crossings. The following design criteria shall apply:
      a.   Storm water crossings of arterial streets shall pass the 100-year
peak discharge under the roadway.
      b.   Design of storm water crossings of all collector and local streets
shall provide all weather access. All weather access requires that the flow
depth in the street be limited to one foot or less during the 100-year storm.
      c.   Where the storm water discharge is less than 500 cfs at a collector
and local streets, a portion of the storm water may be allowed to cross over
the roadway. If a portion of the flow crosses over the roadway, flow depth in
the roadway may not exceed 0.6 feet in depth and the 100-year peak flow must be
fully contained within the right-of-way (channel right-of-way and street right-
of-way).
      d.   Drainageways or open channels may cross a local street carrying no
more than 1,000 vehicles per day, as determined by the Trip Generation manual
of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, if there exists at least one all-
weather access route available to all properties in the area to be developed. A
concrete pavement crossing is required at all dip crossings. Painted bollards
are required at the sides of the concrete pavement to show depth of flow.
Advance warning signs shall advise motorists not to cross when flooded. The
100-year discharge must be contained within the drainage/street right-of-way.
      e.   The bottom is earthen with grade control structures and the banks
are armored when the conditions above are exceeded.
      f.   Bank armor that has a natural appearance when established. Rip rap,
gabions, rail bank, and pre-approved geotechnical reinforcing mats are
encouraged. Concrete and grouted rip rap are discouraged for use as bank armor.
      g.   Bed erosion is to be controlled by grade control structures. See
requirements for grade control structures below.
   6.   Ditches and Channels. Shall be designed so that:
      a.   Anticipated velocities in unarmored ditches and channels shall not
exceed 3 feet per second (fps). Peak flow in unarmored ditches and channels
shall not exceed 50 cfs.
      b.   The bottom is earthen with grade control structures and the banks
are armored when the conditions above are exceeded.
      c.   Bank armor that has a natural appearance when established. Rip rap,
gabions, rail bank, and pre-approved geotechnical reinforcing mats are
encouraged. Concrete and grouted rip rap will not be permitted for use as bank
armor.
      d.   Bed erosion is to be controlled by grade control structures. See
requirements for grade control structures below.
   7.   Grade Control Structures. Grade control structures are to be designed
using the following criteria:
      a.   Channel bottom is to be left as natural earth or armored in such a
way as to encourage vegetation growth. Longitudinal concrete or grouted rip rap
armor in channel bottoms will not be permitted. Localized armor is required to
control erosion at grade control structures.
      b.   Equilibrium slope of all channel bottoms is assumed to be zero
(level).
      c.   Depth of grade control structures shall be at least 1 foot below the
calculated scour depth.
      d.   Maximum depth of grade control structures to be 6 feet unless the
structure is designed structurally support the upstream channel bed. Design of
deeper grade control structures require structural calculations stamped by a
civil engineer registered in the state of Arizona.
   8.   Bank Armor. Bank armor is to be designed using the following criteria:
      a.   Channel bottom is to be left as natural earth or armored in such a
way as to encourage vegetation growth.
      b.   Channel armor shall extend at least one foot below anticipated scour
depths longitudinally and at grade control structures.
      c.   Channel armor shall extend at least one foot below anticipated
equilibrium bed of channel. Bed elevations to be determined from downstream
hard points such as grade control structures or culvert crossings.
      d.   Channel armor shall extend one foot above calculated water surface
elevations. Water surface elevation calculations shall include the anticipated
superelevation in bends.
   9.   Storm Drains. All storm drain systems are to be designed using the
following criteria:
      a.   Design of all storm drain system shall include hydraulic grade line
(HGL) calculations. HGL to be below all inlets and manholes.
      b.   HGL calculations to account for all friction losses including
entrance and exit losses, bend losses, and pipe friction losses.
      c.   HGL calculations are to assume water surface elevation at outlet at
the top of pipe. Alternate outlet water surface elevations may be used if
supported by hydraulic calculations.
      d.   Storm drain inlet capacity shall be calculated using the following
clogging factors:
               •   Grated openings in sag - 50% clogged
               •   Grated openings on a continuous grade - 40% clogged
               •   Curb openings in a sag - 20% clogged
               •   Slotted drains on grade - 20% clogged
               •   Slotted drains in sag - 50% clogged
               •   Combination inlets - use appropriate clogging factors shown
above for each component of the inlet
         (1)    Design Criteria for Small Diameter Storm Drains - Storm drains
having pipes 48 inches in diameter or smaller shall be designed to the
following criteria:
            (a)   Manholes or catch basins are to be located at all changes in
direction of pipes, slope of pipes, or pipe junctions.
            (b)   Maximum manhole spacing to be 500 feet.
            (c)   Pipes must have at least three feet of cover above the top of
the pipe. If less than three feet of cover is provided, pipe material shall be
concrete. A minimum of 2 feet of cover is permitted at catch basins if the
depth of cover increases to three feet within 10 feet of the catch basin.
            (d)   These design criteria shall apply to small diameter lateral
pipes that discharge to a large diameter trunk line.
            (e)   Pipes to be installed in accordance with City of Sierra Vista
Trench Detail.
         (2)   Design Criteria for Large Diameter Storm Drains - Storm drains

following criteria:
            (a)   Maximum manhole spacing to be 800 feet.
            (b)   Manholes are to be located within approximately 20 feet from
bends having an angle greater than 60 degrees from the tangent alignment.
Maximum spacing criteria shall be applied to bends less than 60 degrees.
            (c)   Bends in trunk lines may be prefabricated pipe sections or

Standard Detail 505. If pipe collars are used the pipes to be joined shall be
trimmed so that no gaps larger than 12 inches remain between the pipe sections
when they are fitted together.
            (d)   Manholes shall be in accordance with MAG Standard Detail 521.
The 4-foot diameter riser shall be a prefabricated TEE section. The trunk line
may not be field cut to install manhole risers.
            (e)   Lateral pipes that intersect the trunk line may be field fit
if the inside diameter of the smaller pipe is less than one-half the outside

   10.   Erosion Protection and Energy Dissipation. Design of open channels,
storm water basins, and improvements in washes shall incorporate adequate
erosion protection and energy dissipation. Design of erosion protection shall
address potential scour depths, bed and bank erosion, bend erosion, and long-
term effects of proposed improvements. Improvements in washes shall not have an
adverse impact on other property owners, including the City of Sierra Vista.
Improvements are to be designed using the following considerations:
      a.   Peak flow to be 100-year, 1-hour design storm. However, design of
erosion protection incorporating hydraulic jumps or spillways shall consider
effects of 10-year and 25-year design storms as well.
      b.   Proposed improvements in washes designated as FEMA floodplains shall
be approval through FEMA by obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision
(CLOMR) before construction and a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) after
completion of construction.
      c.   Design of erosion protection and energy dissipation structures shall
incorporate whatever materials are necessary to withstand design conditions.
However, concrete and grouted rip rap are to be avoided whenever possible.
      d.   Design criteria of other portions of the Development Code shall be
followed when designing these structures.
      e.   Erosion setbacks from washes may be used in lieu of armoring with
the approval of the City Engineer.
      f.   Setbacks from existing or future drainage ways shall be as allowed
per Section
151.22.029.D, erosion setback distances shall be as calculated using the
procedure described Section 7.6 of the Standards Manual for Drainage Design and
Floodplain Management in Tucson, Arizona, 1998 Revision. Use of erosion
setbacks shall be guided by the requirements of the Surface Water Plan.
Preservation of the riparian vegetation zone is encouraged wherever possible.
Substitution of setbacks for the preservation of the riparian vegetation zone,
in lieu of channel improvements, may be allowed in Flood Erosion Control
Corridors, if approved by the City Engineer.
      g.   Requirements of this section do not apply to components of Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPP) required by the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality.
   11.   Design of Improvements in Regional Washes. Regional washes are defined
as those washes addressed in the Surface Water Plan (SWP). The SWP has
determined the hydrology information to be used to design and construct the
drainage improvements necessary to capture, control, and convey storm water
runoff through the City. Developers should consult the SWP to identify the
recommended locations and sizes of regional drainage facilities, and
recommended improvements as they affect new development. Specifically, the
Surface Water Plan identifies potential locations for regional detention
basins; defines Natural Drainage Maintenance Corridors (NDMC); defines Flood
and Erosion Control Corridors (FECC); and designates regional washes as NDMCs
and FECCs. The SWP makes the following recommendations regarding NDMCs and
FECCs:
      a.   Natural Drainage Maintenance Corridors (NDMC). Natural Drainage
Maintenance Corridors (NDMCs) have been established at the locations
recommended by the Surface Water Plan. Said locations have been established in
undeveloped areas, within open space/ recreation areas, or where channel
velocities in developed areas have been determined to be low. The purpose for
the NDMC is to maintain a continuous flood hazard and erosion hazard buffer
along established channels. Preservation of the mature riparian environment
along the channel should provide a natural stabilizing influence and reduce
erosion. The most restrictive of the following setbacks shall be established
and maintained.
         (1)   The FEMA floodway.
         (2)   The limits of the riparian vegetation zone, as determined by
recent aerial photographs.
         (3)   A 50 foot setback from each bank of the low flow channel for
watersheds less than or equal to 1.5 square miles; or a 100-foot setback from
each bank of the low flow channel for watercourses draining watersheds greater
than 1.5 square miles.
      b.   Flood and Erosion Control Corridors (FECC). The purpose of
establishing a FECC is to determine and designate the location, direction of
flow, and required setbacks for future drainage improvements. A detailed
determination of the FECC limits shall require floodplain mapping. The limits
of the Flood and Erosion Control Corridor (FECC) shall be determined as
follows:
         (1)   Up to a 100-foot wide drainage way centered within the FECC,
that would allow for any drainage improvements necessary to control and convey
the flows determined to be contributed by the upstream watershed upon ultimate
development upstream.
         (2)   Setbacks for flood and erosion protection shall be established
at a distance of 50 feet from each side of the drainage way for watercourses
draining watersheds up to and including 1.5 square miles.
         (3)   Setbacks for flood and erosion protection shall be established
at a distance of 100 feet from each side of the drainage way for watercourses
draining watersheds greater than 1.5 square miles.
         (4)   The setbacks indentified in items 2 and 3 may be reduced
depending on drainage characteristics and the nature of the proposed
improvements, as determined by the City Engineer. At a minimum, a 20-foot
maintenance access easement shall be required on one side of the drainageway.
      c.   Information included in the Surface Water Plan is to be considered
as preliminary planning information only. Design of regional facilities shall
be based on the best information and data available. Regional storm water
facilities are subject to the following considerations:
         (1)   Where development occurs downstream prior to the construction of
upstream drainage improvements identified in the Surface Water Plan, the
developer shall construct the necessary drainage improvements such that the
improvements are capable of controlling and conveying the existing flows for
the 100-year storm.
         (2)   Developers have the option of constructing upstream improvements
to satisfy the intent of the Surface Water Plan, if approved by the City
Engineer. The upstream improvements must be adequate to protect the developed
parcel free of flood damage during the 100-year storm and the design criteria
specified herein must be satisfied.
         (3)    Armoring on one bank of a regional wash will not be permitted.
   12.   Storm Water Basins, General. Storm water basins shall be used to
detain/retain storm water from new development as follows:
      a.   Storm water runoff shall be detained/retained so that there is no
increase in undeveloped peak flows from the site after development. The pre-
development and post-development peak flows from the 10-year and 100-year, 1-
hour storms shall be evaluated to determine compliance.
      b.   Where existing improvements such as parking lots exist, the
requirements of this section apply and the new development will be treated as
development on previously undisturbed ground in terms of stormwater detention/
retention requirements.
      c.   Whenever feasible, storm water basins should detain flows rather
than retain flows. Retention basins will not be permitted if it is feasible to
discharge flows from the basin through a discharge pipe into a public street
right-of-way, dedicated drainageway, or improved drainage easement that has the
capacity to convey the flow.
      d.   Basins shall be designed to drain all runoff associated with the
100- year, 1-hour storm within 72 hours. Removal of runoff from the basin may
be through percolation/infiltration or through a discharge pipe into a public
street right-of-way, dedicated drainageway, or improved drainage easement that
has the capacity to convey the flow. If the basin is to be drained by
percolation/infiltration alone, percolation calculations stamped by
geotechnical engineer registered in the state of Arizona are required.
      e.   Preliminary percolation tests shall be performed during the design
stage of the basin at the ultimate finish grade of the bottom of the basin.
      f.   Basins that are designed to retain stormwater shall be scarified at
the end of the construction period to maximize percolation capacity. At a
minimum, basins shall be seeded with native grasses upon completion of
construction.
      g.   Drainage runoff to be detained/retained on site. Storm water basins
may not encroach City street right-of-way, dedicated washes or drainage
easements (does not include area specifically platted as the storm water basin
within a single family residential subdivision), FEMA floodplains, erosion
setbacks, or Natural Drainage Maintenance Corridors.
      h.   Storm water basins shall be equipped with an emergency overflow
weir. Water discharging from the weir shall flow directly into a public street
right-of-way, dedicated drainageway, or improved drainage easement that has the
capacity to convey the flow. The weir and the pathway to the discharge point
shall be open and not prone to clogging under reasonable circumstances. Pipes
shall not be used to meet the emergency overflow requirement. The weir shall be
armored to resist erosion that could be caused by 20% of the 100-year peak
flow.
      i.   Minimum diameter of discharge pipe shall be 18 inches. An orifice
plate on a concrete headwall may be used to reduce the discharge from the pipe.
This provision is recommended, but not mandatory for basins located in
commercial, industrial, or multi- family developments.
      j.   Basin inlets and outlets shall be protected from erosion associated
with the peak flow for the 100-year, 1-hour storm.
      k.   Where stormwater detention/retention cannot be located on site, off-
site detention/retention may be permitted provided it is within the same
watersdhed or subwatershed, as determined by the City Engineer.
   13.   Storm Water Basins, Single Family Residential. Storm water basins
shall be used to detain/retain storm water from new single family residential
developments as follows:
      a.   In single family residential subdivisions, whether public or
private, the land occupied by the storm water basins shall be dedicated to the
City for public use on the plat. The developer shall maintain the basin until
the entire subdivision is developed and improvements are accepted by the City,
at which time the City will assume maintenance responsibilities.
      b.   Wherever practical, all runoff from a subdivision shall be detained
at a single basin.
      c.   Maximum water depth in basin shall be 3 feet. All basins shall be
provided with one foot of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation.
      d.   Maximum side slope shall be 4:1 (horizontal to vertical).
      e.   The City may accept storm water basins in single-family residential
subdivisions as recreational facilities provided any appurtenances such as
recreational equipment, ramadas, landscaping, etc., are approved by the City
for future maintenance considerations. Improvements not acceptable to the City
may not be installed.
      f.   Storm water basins on individual lots will not be permitted in
subdivisions in lieu of a single basin.
      g.   At a minimum, basins shall be seeded with native grasses upon
completion of construction.
      h.   Basin design and construction shall include provisions for adequate
access to all improvements for maintenance.
   14.   Storm Water Basins, Commercial. Storm water basins shall be used to
detain/retain storm water from new commercial, industrial, or multi-family
developments as follows:
      a.   Individual storm water basins shall be installed at all new
commercial, industrial, and multi-family developments.
      b.   Basins associated with commercial, industrial, and multi-family
developments shall be owned and maintained by the property owner.
      c.   Parking areas may be used wholly or in part to detain storm water
within commercial developments providing the following criteria are met:
         (1)   Detained water shall not be held on public pavement or encroach
public improvements.
         (2)   Depth of detained water shall not exceed 9 inches within
designated parking spaces.
         (3)   A non-clogging emergency overflow weir shall be provided to
prevent water from exceeding a depth of 9 inches in designated parking spaces.

   15.   Harvested Storm Water Detention, Commercial
      Rainwater harvesting as a means to address stormwater detention
requirements is allowable. The City adheres to the Best Management Practices
found on the University of Arizona Extension Office Water Wise website
(waterwise.arizona.edu).
      a.   Storage of rooftop and/or parking lot runoff may be used to offset
the required capacity of detention/retention basins. An analysis of the
capacity of the storm water collection system shall be included in the
hydrology report/statement. Depending on tank(s) capacity, portions, or all, of
the roof area may be deductible from the site area for purposes of storm water
calculations. The following criteria shall apply:
         (1)   Harvested water shall be used for site landscape irrigation
only, preferably instead of groundwater irrigation.
         (2)   Multiple tanks may be used.
         (3)   Above ground tanks may be used but must be sealed as per the
BMP’s to prevent mosquito breeding.
         (4)   Underground tanks may be used but must be sealed as per the
BMP’s and a pumping system utilized.
         (5)   Other design parameters shall meet the BMP’s.
      b.   Parking lot runoff directed to landscaped water harvesting basins
(“passive water harvesting”) may be used to offset the required capacity of
detention/retention basins. An analysis of the capacity of storm water captured
shall be included in the hydrology report/statement. The following criteria
shall apply:
         (1)   Basin depth must be a minimum of 6 inches.
         (2)   Basin depth shall not exceed 18 inches.
         (3)   Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1.
         (4)   Storm water must percolate into the ground within 72 hours.
         (5)   Landscaping in the basins can count toward the 15 percent site
landscaping requirement per
Article 151.15.
         (6)   Discharge of storm water from basins, whether by design or by
overflow, shall not allow outflow of groundcover materials into parking lot,
public sidewalk or streets.
F.   Drainage Runoff Discharge Planning
   1.   Storm water shall be conveyed through a development or subdivision in a
manner that will not damage improvements within the development or subdivision
nor create an undue nuisance to the inhabitants thereof. When improvements
within a development or subdivision change the natural flow of storm drainage,
they shall be designed in a manner that will not damage the land or change the
flow characteristics of the natural drainage over the land upstream or
downstream from the development or subdivision.
   2.   All new developments shall accept upstream drainage runoff from
adjacent undeveloped land to preserve the historical flow direction and
pattern, in accordance with Title 45 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Upon
development, the adjacent upstream public or private property shall comply with
the requirements of this section.
   3.   Upon development of a private lot that receives offsite runoff,
provisions shall be made to safely collect and convey the offsite runoff across
the lot. If available, the runoff shall be discharged to a downstream public
drainageway or into a drainage easement dedicated to the public. In the event
the runoff must be discharged onto another private lot, the runoff shall be
discharged in the location that historically received the runoff. The owner of
the lot being developed shall grant an easement to the public to convey the
offsite flows to the discharge point. If future upstream development is
expected to eliminate the encroachment by offsite runoff, the drainage easement
may be temporary. Temporary drainage easements shall be set to expire
contingent upon the expected upstream development. Detention or retention of
offsite water is not required.
   4.   In the event that the developer is not able to discharge to a dedicated
drainageway or a drainage easement, the developer shall attempt to obtain a
drainage easement from the downstream owner. If the downstream owner landowner
refuses to grant an easement, the developer shall provide a copy of a certified
letter sent to the downstream landowner advising him of the developer’s rights
under Title 45 of the Arizona Revised Statutes.
   5.   Once runoff has been collected in a conveyance (wash, street, channel,
storm drain, ditch, etc.) owned by the City of Sierra Vista, it shall remain
within a public easement. Discharge of storm runoff from a dedicated easement
onto private property is prohibited. Storm water within a public easement must
always be discharged into another public drainageway or into a drainage
easement dedicated to the public.
   6.   All concentrated storm drainage that cannot be conveyed in a public
street right-of-way shall be conveyed in a dedicated drainage way or in an
improved (paved) drainage easement. Dedicated drainage ways shall be vested in
the public for public use and to construct, operate, and maintain improvements
for the control and conveyance of storm water and for recreational area
purposes. Drainage ways shall not be included in any lot. Drainage easements
are dedicated for public use, but the right to use them to construct and
maintain drainage facilities shall be granted to the public and they may be
included in a lot. The use thereof shall be restricted to uses that will not
interfere with the maintenance of the natural flow of storm drainage over and/
or under the easement. All drainage easements and dedicated drainageways shall
be at least 20 feet in width. A drainage way shall be provided and so
designated when the expected flow for the 100-year storm exceeds (100) cfs, or
cannot be conveyed within the minimum drainage easement width. Both
drainageways and drainage easements shall be provided to accommodate the flow
expected to occur at least once every 100 years, plus one foot of freeboard, or
as described herein.

Section 151.08.007 Streetlight Design and Construction
A.   General Requirements
   1.   Developers of new subdivisions, commercial, and industrial projects, or
major additions thereto, are responsible for the design, materials, and
installation costs of all streetlighting on all public streets within and
adjacent to their project. This requirement applies to both improved and
unimproved public right-of-way, adjacent to development site. The City of
Sierra Vista will pay all costs associated with providing ongoing electrical
service after the City approves activation of the streetlights.
   2.   Streetlighting plan approval and expiration parallels site plan and/or
subdivision plat approval and expiration and requires re-submittal if the
improvement plans are updated.
   3.   Adherence to the designed pole locations is expected. Exceptions may be
granted for shifts up to 10± feet parallel to the roadway due to field
conditions. Where underground obstructions are encountered, any shift in pole
placement must not interfere with a driveway and/or ADA accessibility. Shifts
perpendicular to the roadway from permit locations will not be allowed without
an approved plan revision.
   4.   Private streetlights should be labeled as such. Private streetlights
are permitted only on private streets and must conform to all applicable City
of Sierra Vista lighting ordinances.
   5.   These regulations do not apply to private onsite development, which
must adhere to Development Code
Article 151.11.
B.   Design Guidelines
   1.   The public streetlight system shall be installed in the right-of-way.
Where right-of-way is not available and where a public utility easement allows
for streetlight equipment, the engineer may design equipment within the
easement with approval from the City of Sierra Vista. The developer will be
required to provide a new public utility easement, if the existing right-of-way
or easement is not sufficient to encompass the new improvements.
   2.   Streetlight layout and design shall include existing and known future
streetlight location information for all streets within and adjacent to the
proposed development. Streetlight poles and equipment should be shown with
station and offset dimensions. In addition, the following information shall be
identified, located, sized, and dimensioned from the center line and/or
monument line:
      a.   Existing and proposed utilities (overhead or underground).
      b.   Face of curb.
      c.   Width of sidewalk.
      d.   Width of any public utility easement (PUE).
      e.   Edge of right-of-way.
      f.   Edge of pavement.
      f.   Driveways and handicapped ramps.
      g.   Any structures that may interfere with streetlight placement.
   3.   There should be a minimum of three (3) feet of clearance between
streetlight poles and other utilities.
   4.   Design conflicts shall be resolved by the design engineer to the
satisfaction of the electrical utility company and the City. It shall be the
design engineer’s responsibility to coordinate conflict resolution with
electric utility company facilities, including vertical clearances without
compromise to the uniformity in the lighting design.
   5.   Public streetlighting plans will show luminaire and pole type and lumen
levels. Streetlight equipment shall conform to approved manufacturers per
current utility company and City standards. For streetlights that will be owned
and maintained by the local utility company, Sulphur Springs Valley Electric
Cooperative, the developer shall be responsible for coordinating streetlighting
design with SSVEC. In all cases, the developer will need to coordinate
electrical service design with SSVEC.
   6.   In an effort to achieve reasonable uniformity, deviations away from the
specified point of radius are permitted up to 25 feet. Any further deviation
must be documented and based on unusual roadway conditions.
   7.   All poles are to be located approximately 1-foot behind the sidewalk
where the sidewalk abuts the curb. Where the sidewalk is detached to create a
landscaped area, poles are to be located within the landscaped area, with an
easement of adequate width for the public improvements if insufficient right-
of-way is available. In no case shall a streetlight be placed within a sidewalk
or multi-use path.
   8.   In areas where standard vertical curb, roll curb or sidewalk does not
exist, all poles shall be centered at least ten (10) feet from the edge of the
roadway.
   9.   A new streetlight conforming to the requirements of this section shall
be placed along the public right-of-way at each multi-family residential,
commercial, and industrial driveway unless there is an existing streetlight
located within 100 feet. Parking lot lights may not be used to meet this
requirement unless extraordinary conditions exist, as approved by the City.
   10.   Efforts shall be made during the design stage to assure that two (2)
streetlights are located diagonal across the intersection from each other at
each arterial street intersection and one streetlight at all other
intersections, unless compliance is infeasible, in which case the required
streetlights shall be located as close to the intersection as practicable.
   11.   All street light poles shall be thirty (30) feet in height, unless
otherwise permitted, and shall utilize metal standards. Wooden standards are
not permitted.
   12.   Although the City currently uses high pressure sodium (HPS)
streetlights and solar street lights, other new technologies (solar, light
emitting diode, etc.) will be considered on a case by case basis. The use of
alternative technologies is primarily for use on local streets, with
consideration being given to other street classifications.
   13.   Streetlights shall be fully shielded. Additional back shields will be
required for streetlights on arterial and collector roadways which are adjacent
to residential zoning districts or residential developments.
C.   Arterial Streets
   Streetlights shall be placed at all intersections and spaced every 200 to
250 feet using 30,000 lumen high pressure sodium lighting. Arterial streets
will be lighted on two sides using staggered spacing. Ideal spacing is 200 to
250 feet along the same side of the street; 100 to 150 feet between
streetlights on opposite sides of the street.
D.   Collector Streets
   Streetlights shall be placed at all intersections and spaced approximately
200 to 250 feet apart using 16,000 lumen high pressure sodium lighting.
Collector streets will be lighted on two sides using staggered spacing, unless
unusual conditions are present in which case lighting on one side of the street
may be permitted. Ideal spacing is 200 to 250 feet along the same side of the
street; 100 to 150 feet between streetlights on opposite sides of the street.
E.   Local Streets
   Streetlights shall be placed at all intersections and spaced approximately
250 feet apart using 9500 lumen high pressure sodium lighting. In residential
areas, midblock streetlight poles should be placed within one foot laterally
from the divisional property line.
   Any public street cul-de-sac having a depth of one hundred fifty (150) feet
or greater from the face of the nearest curb of the intersecting street to the
cul-de-sac radius point will have a streetlight or lights located in the cul-
de-sac.

Section 151.08.008 Utility Trench Backfill Requirements
A.   General Requirements
   An important and high priority goal of the City of Sierra Vista is to assure
proper utility trench backfill operations within public streets and/or rights-
of-way when trenching is allowed. MAG Specifications (Section 601) is the basic
premise used by the City to control backfill operations, and for developing a
utility trench backfill policy that will minimize trench settlement and street
repair costs to the City.
   Utility trenching in public rights-of-way can be categorized under three
different situations:
   1.   Trenching outside of an existing or proposed street prism.
   2.   Trenching within an existing street prism.
   3.   Trenching within a proposed street prism to be constructed as part of a
new development/subdivision.
      A street or roadway prism is defined as any existing or proposed
pavement, curb, gutter, sidewalk, or such construction specified in a
construction contract, or when any part of the trench excavation is within two
feet of the improvements previously mentioned.
      Utility trench excavation, pipe bedding, and shading requirements for
trenching activities conducted under any of the three categories previously
mentioned shall comply with MAG Specifications outlined in Section 601.
However, utility trench "backfill requirements," as outlined in MAG
Specifications under Section 601, are hereby modified below for each of the
three utility trench categories in order to achieve and maintain the City's
goal of minimizing utility trench settlements and street repair costs caused by
failed utility trench crossings.
B.   Utility Trench Backfill Requirements Outside an Existing or Proposed
Street Prism
   Utility trench excavations and backfill requirements pertaining to mainline
sewers, lateral sewer lines, water, power, gas, telephone, and cable
underground installations that lie outside and/or parallel to an existing or
proposed street prism, but are located within a public utility easement, public
street right-of-way, or unpaved alley, shall conform with MAG Specifications,
as modified by the following requirements:
   1.   Utility Trench Backfill Material.
      a.   Native material may be used as backfill material in utility trenches
in unpaved alleys and in public utility easements provided the native material
meets the following criteria:
         (1)   Material is free of broken concrete, broken pavement, rubbish,
chunks of clay, wood, organic material, or other deleterious material.
         (2)   Material does not contain rock or stones larger than three

according to the standards adopted by the City.
E.   Handicapped Parking. All parking areas and spaces shall conform to the
standards specified in the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility
Guidelines and amendments. The handicapped parking space shall be appropriately
striped, and a parking space sign meeting the City's standards shall be
permanently placed in front of the space. In accordance with adopted standards,
all handicapped spaces shall be located as close to the entrance as possible.
F.   Cycle Parking. In all new multi-dwelling and commercial developments,
there shall be sufficient areas established to provide for parking of
motorcycles and mopeds. Such areas shall be clearly defined and reserved for
the exclusive use by motorcycles and mopeds.
G.   Pedestrian Access. Every parking lot shall provide a clearly identified

depressed grade, or any other method approved by the City. Regardless of the
zoning district in which the parking lot is located, every part of a parking
lot shall be set back a sufficient distance from every lot line to insure that
no part of any parked vehicle will project over any lot line or obstruct any
public or private sidewalk.
P.   Lighting. Parking lots used during hours of darkness shall be lighted.
Pole-mounted lighting less than 13 1/2 feet in height shall be protected

NOTES:
   1.   For one row of stalls, use "C" plus "D" as minimum width.
   2.   Public alley width may be included as part of dimension "D," but all
stalls must be on private property, off the public right-of-way.
   3.   For estimating the available parking area, use 350 square feet per
vehicle for stall, aisle, and access area.
   4.   The stall width for self-parking of long duration is 8.5 feet; for
higher turnover self- parking is 9.0 feet; and for supermarkets and similar
facilities (shoppers with packages) is 9.5-10.0 feet.
   5.   The minimum aisle width for two-way traffic and for emergency vehicle
operations is 24 feet. The minimum aisle width for one-way traffic and for
emergency vehicle access is 20 feet. Only certain aisles may be needed for
emergency vehicle access.
   6.   If a vehicle overhangs a private sidewalk, a minimum accessible area of
3 feet must be maintained for pedestrian access.
S.   All required off-street parking shall be located as follows:
   1.   On the same or contiguous lot(s) or parcel(s) of land of the use the
parking is intended to serve.
   2.   On land in the same ownership as the use the parking is intended to
serve.
   3.   On land which has the same zoning classification or a zoning
classification which allows Permitted or Conditional uses, as the use the
parking is intended to serve.
T.   Alternative locations may be approved as part of the site plan review
process provided the parking provided at the alternative location is within 600
feet of the use to be served, as measured along the most direct pedestrian
route from property line to property line. The pedestrian connection shall
require no crossing of a collector or arterial street and shall be lighted.
Further, a parking agreement, in a form approved by the City Attorney shall be
recorded with the Cochise County Recorder's Office, at the owner's expense,
providing that the off-premise parking area will not be disposed of except in
conjunction with the sale or use of the building the parking area serves so
long as the parking is required.

feet, excluding vertical distances being served by an elevator.
C.   Uses Not Specifically Mentioned. In the case of a use not specifically
mentioned, the requirements for off-street loading facilities shall be the same
as the above mentioned use which, as determined by the City, is most similar to
the use not specifically mentioned.
D.   Concurrent Different Uses. When any proposed structure will be used
concurrently for different purposes, final determination of loading
requirements will be made by the City but, in no event, shall the loading
requirements be less than the total requirements for each use based upon its

Section 151.10.001 Purpose
It is the purpose of this article to regulate signs. Regulations put forth in
this Article promote traffic safety, safeguard public health and comfort,
facilitate police and fire protection, enhance community appearance, and
protect the character of the City. The sign regulations are designed for
maximum sign legibility and effectiveness and to prevent the over
concentration, improper placement, and excessive height, bulk, and area of the
signs. Residential, commercial, and industrial signs are generally intended to
be located in those zoning districts where the activities are allowed and where
signs directly relate to the activities on the premises.
('76 Code, Art. 12-1) (Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86; Am. Ord. 834, passed 3-9-89;
Am. Ord. 2005-021, passed 11-22-05; Am. Res. 2025-036, passed 5-8-25; Am. Ord.
2025-003, passed 6-12-25)
Section 151.10.002 Measurement Standards
   A.   The area of a sign that consists of individual letters, word and
symbols, which are painted or placed upon a building wall or freestanding wall,
and are not encompassed by a frame or boundary shall be computed by measuring
the sum of the squared-off area of individual letters.
   B.   For all other types of signs, the area shall include the overall height
and length of the sign face. However, the measurements shall not include
structural or architectural elements located outside the limits of the sign
face and not forming an integral part of the display. The portion of a
freestanding sign above the sign face shall not exceed twenty-five percent
(25%) of the maximum permitted sign height which may include property address,
plaza or shopping center name on multi-tenant properties, or other
architectural feature.
   C.   Setbacks for freestanding signs shall be measured from the edge of the
sign closest to the property line. On existing developed sites, the Community
Development Director may waive or reduce the required setback of a freestanding
sign to the minimum extent necessary to accommodate the current layout and
design features on a site or other constraints deemed to be practicably
infeasible to adjust.
   D.   The total square footage of all face surfaces of a spherical or multi-
faced sign shall not exceed twice the allowable square footage of a single-
faced sign.

22-05; Am. res. 2025-036, passed 5-8-25; Am. Ord. 2025-003, passed 6-12-25)
Section 151.10.003 Applicability
   A.   All signs erected, altered, or displayed on or after the effective date
of this Code shall be subject to its provisions, and unless specifically
exempted, shall require a sign permit from the City.
   B.   Signs or other advertising structures shall be constructed and
maintained in conformity with the City’s building codes and other applicable
regulations.
   C.   All signs shall comply with other applicable Federal and State laws.
   D.   The sign face of a legal nonconforming sign may be replaced as long as
the extent of the nonconformity is not increased.
   E.   The following signs shall be exempt from the permit requirements of
this Article, provided that all applicable sections of this Article are met:
      1.   Government signs;
      2.   Warning signs;
      3.   Murals, statues, paintings, designs or other decorative features,
not including any text, provided no drawings, imagery of products or services
provided by a commercial or industrial use located onsite, graphic
representations of a business name, trademark, logo or other commercial imagery
are present;
      4.   Construction signs;
      5.   One real estate sign per parcel per street frontage;
      6.   Window signs;
      7.   Interior electronic reader board or LED signs that are a maximum of
four-square feet within two (2) feet of the window and visible from the
exterior of the building;
      8.   Interior signs which are displayed on the inside of the building and
not visible from a public street;
      9.   Addressing numbers;
      10.   Directional signage four (4) square feet or less in area and three
(3) feet or less in height when ground mounted;
      11.   Government/public/religious flags;
      12.   Corporate or company logo flags, limited to one per parcel; and
      13.   The replacement of a sign face that does not alter the size, shape,
height or location of the existing sign structure; does not introduce
electronic or illuminated elements not previously approved; and is limited to
non-structural components such as inserts, panels, or graphics.

Section 151.10.004 Portable Signs
The purpose of this section is to regulate portable signs to ensure that they
do not create visual clutter, traffic hazards, or obstructions while allowing
for temporary advertising and messaging. Portable signs shall meet the
following requirements:
   A.   A permit is required for portable signs except for residential yard
signs, post and panel signs, feather banners, and signs that cannot be viewed
from a public street. The permit shall specify the duration, location, and
design of the sign.
   B.   Portable signs must be professionally made or neatly hand painted.
   C.   No flashing lights, animations, or moving parts allowed.
   D.   Materials shall be durable and resistant to weather conditions.
   E.   Must be weighted or anchored to prevent tipping over.
   F.   Reflective or highly luminous materials shall not be used.
   G.   Shall be maintained in good condition.
   H.   Shall not be placed in the City right-of-way or City owned structures
or buildings, unless first approved by the City.
   I.   Placed in a location that is not hazardous to public safety, obstruct
the clear vision area, or interfere with ADA accessibility.
Portable signs are allowed only in compliance with the provisions of Table A
and require a portable sign permit prior to the display of the sign except
where noted. Portable signs exempt from permitting remain subject to the
requirements of this section.

Section 151.11.002 Conformance with Applicable Codes
A.   All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be installed in conformance with the
provisions of this Article and any other building code requirements, as
applicable.
B.   Where any provisions of any of the Arizona Revised Statutes, any federal
law, or any companion ordinance conflict with the requirements of this Outdoor
Light Control Article, the most restrictive provision shall govern.
C.   All new development and those portions of any addition to an existing
commercial, industrial, or multi-family development requiring a commercial site
plan review and requiring outdoor lighting shall meet the requirements of this
Article.
D.   All outdoor light fixtures, existing and fully installed, or for which a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Article,
shall be considered legal non- conforming (see
Article 151.24). No modification or replacement shall be made to a
nonconforming fixture unless the fixture thereafter conforms to the provisions
of this Article, except that lamp and related apparatus (lens, ballast, etc.)
replacement is allowed. Abandoned site lighting fixtures shall be regulated
according to the provisions of
Article 151.24.
E.   Legal, non-conforming lighting fixtures may continue to be used provided
such fixtures are turned off between the hours of 10:00 p.m. (or when the
business activities cease, whichever is later) and sunrise. This requirement
does not apply to fixtures used for safety or security purposes. Non-conforming
lights that are improperly aimed and, as a result, are considered a detriment
to public health, safety, and welfare shall be regulated under the City’s
public nuisances and property maintenance codes.
F.   A reduction of non-conforming lighting fixtures is required on an existing
developed commercial site where a site plan or modified site plan review is
required for new development. This reduction shall be as determined by the
City. Possible means for this reduction are as follows:
   1.   Appropriate fixture aiming to reduce light trespass;
   2.   Tilting any existing fixtures to a horizontal position to maximize
available shielding;
   3.   Adding shielding to fixtures when possible;
   4.   Utilizing motion sensors or automatic shutoff devices to eliminate
unnecessary use of energy resources.
   5.   Conforming lighting fixtures shall be turned off between the hours of
10:00 p.m. (or when the business activities cease, whichever is later) and
sunrise. This requirement does not apply to fixtures used for safety or
security purposes. (Sign lighting cannot be used for security lighting
purposes.)

Section 151.15.001 Purpose
The Landscaping, Plant Salvage, Walls, Screening and Buffering Article is
designed to provide standards for the installation of landscaping, walls and
buffer areas so as to promote the general welfare of the community. This is
accomplished by encouraging the creation of an attractive appearance along
public streets and by screening from view those uses that may be unattractive
to the public eye. Landscaping materials, including ground cover, shrubs and
trees, further promote the control of erosion and the reduction of glare and
dust, as well as the visual softening of building masses. Walls and screening
devices allow for the separation of clashing uses and for the buffering of
intensive activities. Landscaping, walls, and screening devices help to
effectuate privacy, facilitate logical development, and enhance property
values.
Plant salvaging promotes the conservation and use of native plants and helps
maintain our sense of regional identity. Native plants, which are adapted to
our climate and soils, generally become established more quickly, are hardier,
and require less water than non- native plants.

Section 151.15.002 General Regulations
This Article shall apply to all projects requiring a site plan per Section
151.18.002 and to collector and arterial road right-of-ways, as defined in the
Traffic Circulation Plan, that adjoin residential subdivisions.
A.   Any proposed building or use shall be shown on the site plan required by
Article 151.18 indicating the location of existing and proposed buildings,
parking areas, street improvements, locations, and types of landscaped areas,
walls, and screening devices.
B.   Occupancy permits may be issued prior to the complete installation of all
required landscaping if security equal to 110 percent of the cost of plant
materials and labor, as verified by the City, is filed assuring such
installation within six months after occupancy.
   1.   Security may consist of one of the following: (1) Posting of a
performance bond by a qualified surety, (2) establishing a cash trust, said
fund to be deposited with the City to the credit of the developer, (3)
depositing with the City a certificate of deposit issued by a banking
institution authorized to issue same, or (4) filing with the City an executed
contract of guarantee between the City and a trust company, banking
institution, or other financial institution authorized to enter into such
contracts.
   2.   If the installation of the landscaping is not completed within the
period specified above, the security may be used by the City to complete the
installation. Upon completion of the installation, any portion of the remaining
security deposited with the City shall be returned. The final landscape
inspection shall be made prior to any security being returned. Any portions of
the landscaping not installed, improperly installed, or not maintained shall
cause the inspection to be postponed until the project is completed or cause
the security to be used by the City.

Section 151.15.003 Native Plant Salvage Requirements
A.   Standards of Design and Development
   1.   Prior to site clearing or grading of any residential subdivision,
multi-family residential, commercial, or industrial development 1 acre or
larger in size a native plant salvage shall be conducted. City staff shall
conduct the salvage on the site and mark each salvageable plant. The City will
provide the developer with the list of salvageable plants and their quantities.
Said plants shall be transplanted or stored on the site or relocated to another
site approved by the City.
   2.   During the review process, consideration shall be given to limiting
disturbance to native plants on the site to the greatest extent possible.
   3.   Developers of residential and commercial subdivisions may be allowed to
meet the intent of this Section through the establishment of open space to
consist of a minimum of 15 percent of the site. The area shall be identified
during the platting process and shall clearly be identified on the plat. Land
set aside as open space in a Planned Area Development may be used to achieve
both goals concurrently.
   4.   The City will utilize the list of native plants identified in Section
151.15.003.A.6as a guideline to determining the native plants which shall be
salvaged. Such factors as plant health, plant location, plant size, plant age,
type of development, access requirements, grading requirements, and other
considerations will be used to determine which plants will be salvaged.
   5.   Salvaged plants in a healthy condition, as determined by the City, can
supplement new landscape plant materials to meet Code Section
151.15.004.A.7, which requires that 15 percent of commercial, multi-family
residential, and industrial areas shall be landscaped, provided the plants are
used on the site and meet the minimum size criteria for trees and shrubs as
defined in this chapter. Any plant materials not surviving shall be replaced
within 180 days of notice from the City to replace the plant materials.
   6.   The following list of native plants shall be considered for salvage:
•   Agaves (SPP)*
•   Cacti (SPP)
•   Yucca (SPP)   
•   Dasylirion Wheeleri (Sotol, Desert Spoon)
•   Ocotillo   
•   Chilopsis Linearis (Desert Willow)

Section 151.19.005 Improvement Security
A.   Acceptable Forms of Security. Before a subdivision plat is presented to
the Council for approval, the subdivider shall post assurances, in a form
acceptable to the City, to assure the installation of required public
improvements. All required improvements shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the latest revision of the Uniform Standard Specifications for
Public Works Construction and the Uniform Standard Details for Public Works
Construction as compiled by the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG), and
the City of Sierra Vista Public Works Engineering Design Standards and
Drawings, as modified and adopted by the Council. Other standards pertaining to
any required improvements shall be approved by the City. The purpose of the
assurances shall be to guarantee that the improvements are installed in a
timely manner and paid for without cost to the City. The City Council accepts
the improvement security when the associated final plat is approved.
   1.   Financial forms of assurance, including cash, letter of credit,
performance bond, certificate of deposit, or other similar instruments, shall
be filed in the office of the City Clerk in an amount equal to the sum of the
cost of construction for all required improvements, including surveying,
construction management, testing, and inspections, as determined by the City
Engineer. All financial form of assurances for the installation of required
improvements on private property shall grant to the town adequate property
rights as determined by the City Attorney to allow the City or the City's
contractor to complete the installation. Where, in the opinion of the Council,
the subdivider has failed or neglected to install the required improvements or
make required corrections within a timely manner, or to pay all liens in
connection with the required improvements, the Council may use the proceeds
from the assurances to install or cause to be installed the required
improvements.
   2.   Third party trust forms of assurance prohibiting the transfer of any
individual subdivision lot or block for which required subdivision improvements
have not yet been installed, are permitted in lieu of financial forms of
assurance.
B.   Completion of Public Improvements
   1.   The required public improvements shall be completed and accepted within
two years of final plat approval. If the plat is phased, only the public
improvements for each individual phase that was approved are required to be
completed within two years.
      Exceptions to the two year completion date are as follows:
      a.   The council grants an extension for good cause. The review of the
extension request shall include an evaluation of any change in conditions
within or adjoining the final plat and the effect of new or current regulations
on the project. Requests for a time extension shall be submitted a minimum of
thirty days prior to the expiration date in writing to the Director of
Community Development; or
      b.   An injunction or a court order requiring that the subdivision plat
process cease. The platting process can commence, once the court order has been
lifted, at the point in the review process where the plat had originally
ceased.
      c.   The developer may elect to construct the sidewalks in conjunction
with each individual platted lot. In this instance the subdivider is required
to complete the entire sidewalk either when all the homes in the subdivision or
phase of the subdivision have been constructed or within 5 years from issuance
of the first building permit of each subdivision phase, whichever is earlier.
Except that, portions of sidewalk not providing vehicular access to the lot,
required sidewalk ramps and required accessible routes shall be completed
within the two year improvement period.
         (1)   In this instance, a separate financial security will be
required. The financial form of assurance, shall be as stated in Section
151.19.005(A)(1) and be in an amount equal to the sum of the cost of
construction. The security shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk.
   2.   The subdivider may submit a written request to extend the completion of
the public improvements. The request shall include the reasons why the
improvements cannot be completed within the stated completion period, and
provide a revised deadline for completion.
      a.   The request for extension shall be considered by the council, whose
decision shall be final.
   3.   A Subdivider's Agreement shall be submitted concurrently with the
improvement security. The Agreement is a contract between the City and the
subdivider which defines the obligations of the subdivider as they relate to
the improvement security, the time frame for completing the public
improvements, and the parameters for the City's acceptance of the improvements.
The City Council accepts the Subdivider's Agreement when the associated final
plat and improvement security are approved and accepted.
C.   Release of Assurances
   1.   Inspections and Acceptance of Improvements. Once all items in this
section are submitted and, the developer has completed all public improvements
as called for on the approved plans and required under this Code and the
Maricopa County Roadway Design Manual, as amended by the City of Sierra Vista,
the City will make a final inspection. If all construction is completed to the
City's satisfaction, the Director of Community Development will recommend to
Council, by Resolution, the final acceptance of the public improvements for
maintenance.
      a.   Final As-Built Plans. The developer shall provide the City with an
electronic copy of as-built improvement plans for inclusion in the City Base
Map. The file(s) shall be compatible with the release of AutoCAD currently
being used by the City or any additional electronically approved format. The
as-built plans shall show all streets, drainage, sewer, and water improvements
constructed within public rights-of-way or public easements. Final as-built
plans shall show the approved design conditions and reflect any field changes
approved by the City Engineer and the developer's engineer. The developer's
engineer shall certify that the final plans represent as nearly as possible the
actual field conditions of all improvements as constructed.
      b.   Developer's Guarantee and Waiver of Liens. The developer shall
certify on the Developer's Guarantee and Waiver of Liens form that is provided
by the City that all bills for labor and materials used in the work have been
paid and agree to indemnify and save harmless the City against any and all
liens, claims of liens, suits, actions, damages, charges, and expenses
whatsoever, which the City may suffer arising out of the failure of the
developer to pay for all labor performed and materials furnished in the
construction of the required improvements. Also, the developer shall guarantee
all public improvements work against defective workmanship or materials for a
period of two years from the date of its final acceptance by the Council.
      c.   Assurance Security. A security shall be provided to the City to
substantiate the validity of the Developer's Guarantee. The amount of the
security shall be $200 per lot. The security shall be retained until the two-
year warranty period has elapsed. The security shall consist of cash, a
performance bond, a certificate of deposit or other assurance as approved by
the City, which meets the requirements in Section 151.19.005(A)(1), Acceptable
Forms of Security.
   2.   Partial Release of Assurances
      a.   Partial Release of Residential Subdivision Assurances for Third
Party Trusts.
         (1)   Where a third party trust is provided as assurance for
completion of improvements, a partial release of a portion of the subdivision
or approved phase of a subdivision may occur, prior to the completion of all
improvements, provided the partial release is proportional to the level of
completion of improvements.
         (2)   Up to 75 percent of the lots held in a third party trust in any
particular phase may be released prior to completion and acceptance of the
public improvements. Any lot(s) released shall be served by the completed and
inspected public improvements. Partial releases greater than 75 percent or a
final release may be granted only when all of the assurable subdivision
improvements have been completed, inspected, and accepted by the City.
      b.   Commercial Subdivisions for Third Party Trust Release. Up to 60
percent of the lots in any particular phase may be released prior to the
completion and acceptance of the public improvements. Any lot(s) released shall
be served by the completed and inspected public improvements. Partial releases
greater than 60 percent or a final release may be granted only when all of the
assurable subdivision improvements have been completed, inspected, and accepted
by the City.
      c.   Reduction or Partial Release of Monetary Assurances. Where a bond,
letter of credit, certificate of deposit, or other monetary assurance is
provided, the amount of the assurance may be reduced upon partial completion of
construction, but, only in a ratio that the improvement(s) bears to the total
improvements indicated on the plat. Where a subdivider completes the required
improvements for a portion of the final plat, monetary assurances for such
improvements may be reduced only where the improvements can be used and
maintained independently of remaining improvements required for the entire
plat. In no case, may more than 75 percent, or 65 percent for commercial
projects, of the total monetary of assurances be released prior to completion
and acceptance of all improvements.
   3.   Substitution of Assurances. Where a third party trust is provided as
assurance for completion of improvements, a substitute assurance may be
submitted for review. The substitute trust includes those portions of the
subdivision to be covered. Additional substitute assurances may be needed to be
in place so that all of the assurable infrastructure that needs completion is
covered. The Third Party Trust or other type of assurances may be entirely
substituted by another form of assurance using cost estimate procedures based
on the remaining improvements.
   4.   Additional Assurances. Notwithstanding assurances provided, if the
Community Development Director, determines that grounds exist that could result
in commercial insecurity that the required improvements will be completed,
additional assurances may be required of the subdivider. The neglect or refusal
of the subdivider to provide such additional assurances within 30 days, shall
result in the immediate suspension of the issuance of any further permits
unless and until further assurance is provided.

Section 151.20.001 Purpose
The purpose of the Architecture and Design Review Article is to promote
reasonable and context-sensitive site and building design standards for certain
types of development including commercial, industrial and certain multi-family
development. Design is a term that is used to describe the image and character
of the city’s built environment and includes both site and building
architectural considerations. More specifically, the Architectural and Design
Review Standards are intended to ensure the following: 
1.   Siting and architectural design of structures harmonize visually with
surrounding development and creates a built environment that is safe and
aesthetically pleasing;
2.   The arrangement of buildings, parking areas, drive aisles, storm water
detention areas, pedestrian ways and other features of the site combine to
create a functional project that is convenient for users of the property.
3.   Unsightly uses, features or activities are screened from public view and
from adjacent property, and dissimilar uses are separated by buffers to prevent
conflicts, promote privacy, and maintain property values;
4.   Landscaping that provides a visually pleasing setting for structures on
the site, complements the architecture of the project, blends harmoniously with
the natural landscape, conserves water, does not conflict with public or
private utilities, and is suited to the site and Sierra Vista's climatic
conditions.
5.   Provide materials and colors that are appropriate to the architectural
style of the structures, complement neighboring properties and project a high
quality image.

Section 151.20.006 Architectural and Design Standards
A.   Facade Materials. Facade materials shall be appropriate to the
architectural style and vernacular of the development and be of high quality
and proven durability in Sierra Vista's weather conditions.
   1.   Approved facade materials include wood, stucco, brick, stone, textured
concrete, glass, textured and split face or ground face concrete masonry units,
and brick, stone, or metal veneers (and their artificial derivatives).
Additional facade materials can be considered as determined by the City. The
materials shall be incorporated in proportionate quantities to the overall
building elevation based on the zoning and location of the development.
      a.   Project located within a commercial zoning district and adjacent to
collector or arterial roadway shall require that 75 percent of the building
wall visible from a public right-of-way or facing an existing residential use
include an approved facade material.
      b.   Project located within a commercial zoning district and adjacent to
local roadway shall require that 50 percent of the building wall visible from a
public right-of- way or facing an existing residential use include an approved
facade material.
      c.   Project located within a industrial zoning district shall require
that 25 percent of the building wall visible from a public right-of-way include
an approved facade material.
      d.   Project located within a residential zoning district shall require
that 50 percent of the building wall visible from a public right-of-way or
facing an existing residential use include an approved facade material.
   2.   At least two (2) different facade materials, shall be used on all walls
of the building that are visible from a public right-of-way or adjacent to a
residential use.
B.   Building Color. The following standards shall apply to building color:
   1.   A minimum of 75 percent of the exterior walls and roofs shall use muted
colors and earth tones with a light reflectance value (LRV) of 50 percent or
less.
   2.   Bright colors are appropriate only for accents.
IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE STANDARDS, AT LEAST THREE ADDITIONAL STANDARDS SHALL
BE MET FROM THE DESIGN ELEMENTS BELOW.
C.   Building Scale. It is important that a building be scaled to its context.
In order to ensure appropriate scale, the following standards shall be used:
   1.   Define a rhythm and pattern of windows, columns, awnings, and other
architectural features;
   2.   Provide a human scale to the primary entrance;
   3.   Express the position of each floor in the external design of a building
to establish a human scale:
      a.   Articulate structural elements; and/or
      b.   Change materials between floors; and/or
      c.   Use an expression line.
D.   Building Massing. The following massing techniques shall be used:
   1.   Wall planes shall be divided into modules that express traditional
dimensions such that a primary facade plane shall not exceed 75 feet in length
without a jog which shall divide the facade into subordinate elements each less
than 75 feet in length.
   2.   Change the height of a wall plane or building mass by providing
vertical articulation. The change in height shall be at least 20 percent of the
vertical height of an adjacent wall plane or building mass;
   3.   Change the roof form to express different modules of the building mass;
   4.   Divide large wall planes into smaller components by changing the
arrangement of windows and other facade articulation features, such as columns
or strap work.
E.   Roof Form. Incorporate the following features to add architectural
articulation and reduce perceived scale:
   1.   Overhanging Eaves;
   2.   Multiple roof planes;
   3.   A cornice or molding to define the top of a parapet;
   4.   A flat roof with parapet
   5.   A sloping roof with a minimum pitch of 4:12.
F.   Location and Orientation of Building Entrances. A building entrance serves
both the building’s tenants and customers. In addition to its functionality, it
can enliven the building’s context, especially    when the building entrance
provides access directly from the public sidewalk. A city block with buildings
that have entrances directly accessible from the public sidewalk encourages
walkability and increases the possibilities for pedestrian movement and
activities, including shopping and social interactions.
   1.   The following standards apply to the design and placement of building
entrances:
      a.   The main entrance to a building that is open to the public shall be
clearly identifiable by emphasizing and enhancing the level of architectural
details such as a change in plane (e.g., porticos, recessed entrance on the
street level facade), differentiation in material and color, or enhanced
lighting.
      b.   The primary entrance of a building shall be oriented to face a
street, plaza or pedestrian way.
      c.   Locate utility, mechanical room, or service entrance doors away from
the public sidewalks.
G.   Windows. The placement, pattern, scale, size, and sequence of windows on
building facades, including proportions and details around them, are an
important aspect of a building’s fenestration as they determine its appeal,
charm, and character. Buildings with poor fenestration appear visually
uninteresting. Scale, proportion, added architectural details, such as
appropriate use of materials, trims, bands (i.e., an expression line) and
cornices bring visual interest to building facades, enhance the building’s
design, provide a connection from the outside to the inside of the building
through a window, and provide a human scaled backdrop to the street space.
   1.   The following standards apply to the design and placement of windows on
a building.
      a.   Maximize the number of street level facade openings for windows.
      b.   Organize the placement of windows and doors on the building
elevation relative to each other and the building’s forms to ensure they are
balanced and proportionate.
      c.   Set storefront window frames at a height above the finished grade to
reflect traditional main street building qualities, such as display windows.
      d.   Recess window frames, including storefronts, from the typical wall
plane surface to provide a shadow line and to accentuate the storefront. At a
minimum, the depth of the recess should be proportionate to the scale of the
window.
      e.   For the upper level facades, provide a fenestration pattern that
includes window openings that are greater in height than width.
      f.   Include operable windows on the upper level facade.
      g.   Delineate changes in surface material by a reveal or a recess
detail.
H.   Site Design. Site design is an important factor when measuring the
economic success of a commercial development. Careful planning, design, and
construction enables new development to take advantage of Sierra Vista's
climate to reduce energy usage and costs, thereby providing long term economic
sustainability as energy prices fluctuate. On the other hand, poor project
siting and design can detrimentally impact the potential to harvest solar
energy, create a less automobile dependent environment, and address economic
sustainability.
   1.   Pedestrian/Outdoor amenities. The following standards apply to the
design and placement of pedestrian amenities:
      a.    Covered walkways or canopies;
      b.   Textured or raised pavement areas for pavement connections within a
site. Such materials shall be designed to minimize the transition between
differing surfaces and should themselves avoid excessive indentation or
texturing;
      c.   Courtyards, pedestrian gathering areas. Low walls or split-rail
fences, or similar, to define such areas, are encouraged.
      d.   Outdoor benches and elements that can be built to include seating,
such as landscape planters;
      e.   Pedestrian-scale light fixtures in areas of high pedestrian use such
as patios, outdoor dining areas, connecting pathways, etc.
      f.   Outdoor dining areas.
   2.   Orientation of Building(s). The following standards apply to the
placement and orientation of buildings:
      a.   Orient to views of activities, architectural landmarks, or natural
features to provide visual interest;
      b.   Orient buildings to take advantage of solar energy that will allow
for passive heating of building, provide natural light, and harvest solar
power.

the Architecture and Design Review of a project:
   1.   Granting Approval. Approved provided the project meet the provisions of
this Article.
   2.   Granting Conditional Approval. Conditionally approved, in coordination
with the applicant, provided the project and conditions in combination meet the
provisions of this Article.
   3.   Denial of Application. A Denied if the project does not meet the
provisions of this Article. In such event, the reasons for the denial shall be
stated in writing to the applicant and every effort to work with the applicant

Section 151.20.008 Waivers
Requests to waive or modify the Architectural and Design Standards or appeal
staff comments will be heard by the Development Review Committee. No waiver or
modification shall be granted unless one or more of the following circumstances
exist:
1.   Superior Alternatives. Where the development will provide an alternative
which will achieve the purposes of the Architectural and Design Standards
through clearly superior design, efficiency, or performance.
2.   Protection of Significant Features. Where the waiver or modification is
necessary to preserve or enhance significant existing environmental or cultural
features
3.   Deprivation of Reasonable Use. Where the strict application of the
Architectural and Design Standards would effectively deprive the owner of all
reasonable use of the land, due to its unusual size, shape, topography, natural
conditions or location; provided:
   (a)   Such effect upon the owner is not outweighed by a valid public purpose
in imposing the Architectural and Design Standards in this case, and
   (b)   The unusual conditions involved are not personal to, nor the result of
actions of the developer or property owner, their predecessors or agents.
4.   Technical Impracticality. Where strict application of the Architectural
and Design Standards would be technically impractical in terms of engineering,
design, or construction practices, due to the unusual size, shape, topography,
natural conditions or location of the land or due to improved efficiency,
performance, safety, or construction practices which will be realized;
provided:
   (a)   The development will provide an alternative adequate to achieve the
purposes of the    requirement; and
   (b)   Any unusual conditions creating the impracticality are not personal
to, nor the result of the actions of the developer or property owner, their
predecessors or agents.
5.   No Relationship to the Development or Its Impacts. Where all or any part
of the Architectural and Design Standards has no relationship to the
development or to the impact of the development on the public facilities, land
use, traffic, or environment of the neighborhood and the general community, due
to the location, scale, or type of development involved.

Section 151.22.005 Official Zoning Map
A.   Establishment. The areas and boundaries of zoning districts are hereby
established as shown on the Official Zoning Map which, together with all
explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be
part of this Code.
B.   Identification. The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the
signature of the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk. Regardless of the
existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning Map which may, from time
to time be made or published, the Official Zoning Map located in the Office of
the City Clerk shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of
land areas, buildings and other structures in the City.
C.   Changes. If, in accordance with the provisions of this Code, changes are
made in district boundaries or in other matters portrayed on the Official
Zoning Map, such changes shall be made by the Director of Community Development
on the map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council,
together with an entry signed by the City Clerk certifying to the accuracy and
date. No changes, of any nature, shall be made in the Official Zoning Map, or
matter shown thereon, except in conformity with the provisions of this Code.
Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be
considered a violation of this Code and punishable as hereinafter provided in
Article 151.32.
D.   Replacement. In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature of the number
of changes and additions, the Council may, by ordinance, adopt a new Official
Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior map. The new Official Zoning Map may
correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior map, but no such
correction shall have the effect of amending the original zoning ordinance or
any subsequent amendment thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be
identified by the signature of the Mayor, and be attested by the City Clerk,
under the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map
supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of
map being replaced) as part of Ordinance No.____ of the City of Sierra Vista,
Arizona."
E.   Interpretation. Where, due to scale, lack of detail, or illegibility of
the Official Zoning Map, there is an uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as
to the intended location of any district boundary shown thereof, the exact
location of such boundary shall be determined by the Director of Community
Development. In reaching his determination, he shall apply the following
standards:
   1.   Zoning district boundary lines are intended to follow lot lines or be
parallel or perpendicular thereto, or along the center lines of streets, alleys
or rights- of-way, unless otherwise fixed by dimensions shown on the Official
Zoning Map.
   2.   In subdivided property or where a zoning district boundary divides a
lot, the exact location of such boundary unless same is indicated by dimensions
shown on the Official Zoning Map, shall be determined by use of the map scale
shown thereon.
   3.   If, after application of the foregoing rules, uncertainty still exists
as to the exact location of a zoning district boundary, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine and fix the location of said line in accordance
with the purposes and intent of this Code.

Section 151.22.006 Matrix of Use Permissions by Zoning District
A.   Use Permissions by Zoning District. No building, structure or land shall
be used, nor shall any use be established unless it complies with the
requirements of this Code.
   1.   Principal Uses (P) are those principal uses that are allowable on a
property within each zoning district as provided in this Section.
   2.   Accessory Uses (A) are those uses which are customarily subordinate to,
integrated with, and clearly incidental to a principal use on the same property
as provided under this Section. The Matrix of Use Permissions identifies
certain accessory uses that are allowable within certain zoning districts.
Accessory uses not specifically listed, but are otherwise deemed to be
compatible with the principal use of the property by the Community Development
Director may be authorized in connection with a building permit.
   3.   Conditional Uses (C) are uses that may be appropriate in the zoning
district and require individual review as to their particular characteristics,
impacts, and location to determine if they require special conditions to their
establishment in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
community in accordance with
Article 151.26 of this Code.
   4.   Non-Conforming Uses (NC) are uses of land or of a structure which do
not meet the use regulations of this Code but which lawfully existed at the
time of adoption of this Code as specified under
Article 151.24 of this Code.

Section 151.22.018 GC - General Commercial
A.   Purpose. This zoning district is comprised of certain lands, structures
and uses which serve the central retail marketing function of the Sierra Vista
trade area. Most persons entering the district will arrive by automobile on a

upon development of comparison shopping with each establishment contributing to
the variety of goods available in the entire district. The essential
interdependence of activities should be given preference over the provision of
direct automobile access to each establishment. Office building activities,
personal and business services, and minor repair services are compatible with
the primary purpose of the district so long as they contribute to the one-stop
shopping objective and are essentially complimentary to the primary function of
retail sales. Regulations are designed to encourage a concentrated development
limited by standards to prevent traffic congestion and to protect the district
from incompatible uses.

Section 151.22.028 AA - Airport Airspace District
A.   Purpose. An Airport Airspace (AA) district, to be superimposed over
existing zoning districts, is established for the purposes of regulating and
restricting the height of structures and objects of natural growth, and
otherwise regulating the use of property in the vicinity of public airports and
heliports designated on the Official Zoning Map by creating airport approach,
transitional, horizontal and conical zones, and establishing the boundaries
thereof. It is hereby found that the creation or establishment of an airport
hazard is a public nuisance and that it is necessary in the interest of the
public health, safety, convenience and welfare that the creation or
establishment of airport hazards be prevented, so as to not endanger the lives
and property of airport users and of occupants and owners of property in the
airport's vicinity.
B.   Establishment of Zones and Height Limitations
   1.   Airport Zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this article,
there are hereby established certain zones which include all of the area under
the approach, transitional, horizontal and conical surfaces defined hereinafter
and shown on the Official Zoning Map. An area located in more than one of the
following zones is considered to be in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitation. The various zones are defined as follows:
      a.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The
approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet to a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet form the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      b.   Utility Runway Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner
edge of this approach coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000
feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      c.   Runway Other Than Utility Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet
at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline
is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      d.   Runway Other Than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater Than
Three-Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet
at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      e.   Runway Other Than Utility with a Visibility Minimum as Low as Three-
Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      f.   Precision Instruments Runway Approach Zone and Military Runway
Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of
the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward

transitional surface.
      i.   Heliport Transitional Zones. These zones extend outward from the
sides of the primary surface and the heliport approach zones a horizontal
distance of 250 feet from the primary surface centerline and the heliport
approach zone centerline.
      j.   Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs
of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual, or arcs of
10,000 feet radii for all other runways from the center of each end of the
primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing
lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of the arcs shall be the same for each
end of the runway and shall be the longest determined for either end. The
horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
      k.   Conical Zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward a
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
C.   Height Limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no
structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be
allowed to grow in any zone created by this Article to a height in excess of
the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. The height
limitations for each zone are as follows:

heliport approach zones centerline.
   10.   Horizontal Zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation.
   11.   Conical Zone. Slopes 20-feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
D.   Use Regulations. The provisions and regulations of the zoning district
over which Airport Airspace (AA) Districts are superimposed, if more
restrictive, shall prevail. No use shall be made of land underlying the surface
boundaries of any zone created by this article in such a manner as to create
electrical interference with radio communication of the airport or aircraft;
make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others;
result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport; impair visibility in
the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or
maneuvering of aircraft.
E.   Hazard Marking. Any use permit that is granted for property underlying the
surface boundaries of any zone created by this article may be so conditioned as
to require the owner of the property for which said permit is desired, at the
owner's expense, to install, operate, and maintain such markings and lights as
may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard, where
such action is deemed advisable due to the presence of such hazard in order to
effectuate the intent of this article.

(Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.22.029 FH – Flood Hazard Overlay District
A.   Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods
   Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Arizona has in
A.R.S. § 48- 3610 enabled the City of Sierra Vista to adopt regulations in
conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3609 designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of
Sierra Vista, Arizona, does ordain as follows:
   1.   Findings of Fact
      a.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Sierra Vista are subject to
periodic inundation by floodwaters. This may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
      b.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from
flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   2.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Flood Hazard (FH)
overlay district, to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare and
to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas
by provisions designed:
      a.   To protect human life and health;
      b.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      c.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      d.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      e.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      f.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      g.   To notify potential buyers that property is in an area of special
flood hazard;
      h.   To notify those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
      i.   To participate in and maintain eligibility for disaster relief;
      j.   To prevent unwise encroachment and building development within areas
subject to flooding.
   3.   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this Code includes methods and provisions for:
      a.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      b.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      c.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      d.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      e.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

151.22.029.F of this Code, meaning the exceptional hardship that would result
from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council of the City of
Sierra Vista requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      d.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         1)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior, or
         2)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   29.   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
the basement. See “Basement.” An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure,
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor,
provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this Code.
   30.   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   35.   Obstruction. Including, but not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   36.   One-hundred-year flood or 100-year flood. A common name for the flood

the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   47.   Structure. A walled and roofed building that is principally above
ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
   48.   Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   49.   Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement to a structure, the total cost of which equals or exceeds
50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      a.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   b.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure.”
   50.   Variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this Code which
permits construction or other uses of property in a manner that would otherwise
be prohibited by this Code.
   51.   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in this Code is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
   52.   Water surface elevation. The height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the
floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
   53.   Watercourse. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or
other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   54.   Zone A. No Base Flood Elevations determined.

terrain); average depths determined. For areas of alluvial fan flooding,
velocities also determined.
   58.   Zone AR. Special Flood Hazard Area formerly protected from the 1%
annual chance flood by a flood control system that was subsequently
decertified. Zone AR indicates that the former flood control system is being
restored to provide protection from the 1% annual chance or greater flood.
   59.   Zone A99. Area to be protected from 1% annual chance flood by a
Federal flood protection system under construction; no Base Flood Elevations
determined.
   60.   Zone D. Areas in which flood hazards are undetermined, but possible.
   61.   Zone X (unshaded). Areas determined to be outside the 0.2% annual
chance floodplain.
   62.   Zone X (shaded). Areas of 0.2% annual chance flood; areas of 1% annual
chance flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with drainage areas
less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from 1% annual chance
flood.
C.   General Provisions
   1.   Lands to Which This Code Applies. This Code shall apply to all areas of
special flood hazards within the corporate limits of Sierra Vista.
   2.   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The area of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance
Study” for Cochise County Arizona and Incorporated Areas” dated August 28,
2008, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated August 28,
2008, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this Code. The Flood Insurance Study and
attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this Code and may be
supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this Code
and which are recommended to the Floodplain Board (Board) by the Floodplain
Administrator. The Floodplain Board, within its area of jurisdiction, shall
delineate (or may, by rule, require developers of land to delineate) where
development is ongoing or imminent, and thereafter as development becomes
imminent, floodplains consistent with the criteria developed by the FEMA and
the Arizona Director of Water Resources. The Flood Insurance Study, and FIRMs,
are on file at the City of Sierra Vista City Hall, Department of Community
Development, Sierra Vista, AZ.
   3.   Compliance. All development of land, construction of residential,
commercial, or industrial structures, or future development within delineated
floodplain areas is subject to the terms of this Code as well as other
applicable regulations.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Code is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this Code and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   5.   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Code, all
provisions shall be:
      a.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      b.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      c.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this Code is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This Code does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This Code shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sierra
Vista, any officer or employee thereof, the State of Arizona, the FIA, or FEMA,
for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Code or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   7.   Statutory Exceptions
      a.   In accordance with A.R.S. § 48-3609.I, unless expressly provided,
this and any regulation adopted pursuant to this Article do not affect:

      c.   In addition to other penalties or remedies otherwise provided by
law, this state, a political subdivision or a person who may be damaged or has
been damaged as a result of the unauthorized diversion, retardation, or
obstruction of a watercourse has the right to commence, maintain, and prosecute
any appropriate action or pursue any remedy to enjoin, abate, or otherwise
prevent any person from violating or continuing to violate this Section or
regulations adopted pursuant to A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 21, Article 1. If a
person is found to be in violation of this Section, the court shall require the
violator to either comply with this Section if authorized by the Floodplain
Board or remove the obstruction and restore the watercourse to its original
state. The court may also award such monetary damages as are appropriate to the
injured parties resulting from the violation including reasonable costs and
attorney fees.
      d.   This section shall not exempt any use which diverts, retards, or
obstructs the flow of water and creates a danger or hazard to life or property
in the City.
   8.   Declaration of Public Nuisance. All development located or maintained
within any area of special flood hazard after August 8, 1973, in violation of
this Code is a public nuisance per se and may be abated, prevented, or
restrained by action of this political subdivision.
   9.   Abatement of Violations. Within 30 days of discovery of a violation of
this Code, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit a report to the Floodplain

determination. Such information must be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator within 30 days of such order, and he shall submit an amended
report to the Floodplain Board within 20 days. At their next regularly
scheduled public meeting, the Floodplain Board shall either order the abatement
of said violation or they shall grant a variance in accordance with the
provisions of Section
151.22.029.F herein; or
      d.   Submit to the FEMA a declaration for denial of insurance, stating
that the property is in violation of a cited state or local law, regulation or
ordinance, pursuant to section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968
as amended.
   10.   Unlawful Acts
      a.   It is unlawful for any person to engage in any development or to
divert, retard, or obstruct the flow of waters in any watercourse if it creates
a hazard to life or property without securing the written authorization
required by A.R.S. § 48.3613. Where the watercourse is a delineated floodplain,
it is unlawful to engage in any development affecting the flow of waters
without securing written authorization required by A.R.S. § 48.3613.
      b.   Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of this Code
shall be guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor. Each day that a violation continues
shall be a separate offense punishable as herein above described.

declared to be severable. Should any section of this Code be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the
section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
D.   Administration
   1.   Establishment of Floodplain Use Permit. A Floodplain Use Permit shall
be obtained before construction or development, including placement of
manufactured homes, begins within any area of special flood hazard established
in Section
151.22.029.C.2.
From and after May 12, 1984, it shall be unlawful to cause or allow any
construction/development, including placement of prefabricated buildings or
manufactured homes, to occur on any land within the area of special flood
hazard, without first applying for and obtaining an Area of Special Flood
Hazard Permit from the Floodplain Administrator, and thereafter complying with
each and every written term of the permit. However, no such floodplain use
permit shall be required for any repairs or alterations for which the value of
the materials and labor thereon does not exceed $500. For the purpose of
determining the value of any such repairs or alterations, the normal retail
value of materials and the reasonable value of the labor performed shall be
used. Even though no floodplain use permit is required, all other provisions of
this Code shall be observed in the performance of said repairs or alterations.
This paragraph shall not apply to any effort to repair or alter property
piecemeal for the purpose of avoiding applying for a permit when the cost of
said work is in excess of $500.
Application for a Floodplain Use Permit shall be made on forms furnished by the
City and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale
showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following
information is required:
      a.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement) of all structures; in Zone AO, elevation of existing
highest adjacent natural grade and proposed elevation of lowest floor of all
structures.
      b.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be floodproofed;
      c.   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
licensed in the State of Arizona that the floodproofing methods for any
nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in Section
151.22.029.E.2.c.3;
      d.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development; and
      e.   Base flood elevation data for subdivision proposals or other
development greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser.
   2.   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Director of Community
Development is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this Code
by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions.
   3.   Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. Duties of
the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
      a.   Review all development permits to determine that:
         (1)   The permit requirements of this Code have been satisfied;
         (2)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
         (3)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
         (4)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this Code, "adversely
affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 1 foot at any point.
         (5)   Improvements and/or damages to existing structures to determine
if the application of the substantial improvement rules apply, including
establishing a definition of market value determination and verifying the
estimated improvement and/or repair costs are less than 50% of the market value
of the structure.
      b.   Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with Section
151.22.029.C.2, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably use any base flood elevation data available from a federal, state,
or other source, in order to administer Section
151.22.029.E. Any such information shall be consistent with the requirements of
the FEMA and the Arizona Director of Water Resources and shall be submitted to
the Board for adoption.
      c.   Delineate, or by rule, require developers of land to delineate for
areas where development is ongoing or imminent, and thereafter as development
becomes imminent, floodplains consistent with the criteria developed by the
Arizona Director of Water Resources.
      d.   Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as
needed for Flood Insurance Policies or effecting Increased Cost of Construction
Coverage for repetitive loss structures:
         (1)   The certified regulatory flood elevation required in Section
151.22.029.E.2.c.1; c.2; and Section
151.22.029.E.11;
         (2)   The Zone AO certification required in Section

their issuance;
         (8)   Permit records for repair of flood-related damage to structures
on a cumulative basis over the life of the structure and all improvement
calculations.
      e.   Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated:
         (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Arizona Department of Water
Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the FEMA through appropriate notification
means;
         (2)   Require that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      f.   As soon as practicable, but no later than six months after the date
information becomes available regarding physical alterations affecting flooding
conditions resulting in potential changes to the Base Flood Elevations, the
Flood Plain Administrator shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting
technical or scientific data in accordance with Volume 44 Code of Federal
Regulations Section 65.3.
      g.   Within 120 days after completion of construction of any flood
control protective works which changes the rate of flow during the flood or the
configuration of the floodplain upstream or downstream from or adjacent to the
project, the person or agency responsible for installation of the project shall
provide to the governing bodies of all jurisdictions affected by the project a
new delineation of all floodplains affected by the project. The new delineation
shall be done according to the criteria adopted by the Arizona Director of
Water Resources.
      h.   Advise the Flood Control District of Cochise County and any adjunct
jurisdiction having responsibility for floodplain management in writing and
provide a copy of development plan of all applications for floodplain use
permits or variances to develop land in a floodplain or floodway within one
mile of the corporate limits of the City of Sierra Vista. Also, advise the
Flood Control District of Cochise County in writing and provide a copy of any
development plan of any major development proposed within a floodplain or
floodway which could affect floodplains, floodways or watercourses within the
District's area of jurisdiction. Written notice and a copy of the plan of
development shall be sent to the Flood Control District of Cochise County no
later than three working days after having been received by the City of Sierra
Vista.
      i.   Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section
151.22.029.F.
      j.   Take actions on violations of this Code as required in Section C.9
herein.
      k.   Notify the FEMA and the Arizona Division of Emergency Management
(ADEM) of acquisition by means of annexation, incorporation, or otherwise, of
additional areas of jurisdiction.
   4.   Denial of Permit. No permit shall be issued for any development which
is not in conformance with this Code or any other provision of law relating to
such development. A floodplain use permit may be denied if the proposed
development constitutes a danger or hazard to life or property. In making such
determination, the Floodplain Administrator may consider the following factors:
      a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights,
velocities, or redirection of flow caused by the development.
      b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or down
stream to the injury of others.
      c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems of any development
and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and
unsanitary conditions if they should become flooded.
      d.   The susceptibility of the proposed development and/or its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners.
      e.   The availability of alternative locations on the same property not
subject to flooding for the proposed use.
      f.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing floodplain use
and with floodplain management programs anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      g.   The relationship of the proposed use to any comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      h.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      i.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
section.
   5.   Conditions. Any floodplain use permit may be subject to conditions or
restrictions designed to reduce or eliminate the potential danger or hazard to
life or property resulting from development within floodplain areas. The
applicant may be required to execute deed restrictions running with the land or
be required to post performance bonds, assurances or such other security as may
be appropriate and necessary to assure the performance of the conditions or
restrictions that may be imposed. The applicant shall be required and
responsible to apply for and obtain all applicable State and Federal permits
required of development within the floodplain.
Flood proofing measures such as the following which shall be designed to be
consistent with the Regulatory Base Flood Elevation for the particular area,
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces,
and other factors associated with the Base Flood. In order to maintain records
of elevation and flood proofing levels for new construction and substantial
improvements, the Floodplain Administrator may require that the applicant
submit a plan or document certified by a State of Arizona registered civil
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the Regulatory
Flood Elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area. Examples
of floodproofing measures that may be required include, but are not limited to,
are:
      a.   Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement.
      b.   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and shutters.
      c.   Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures.
      d.   Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water
through walls.
      e.   Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation.
      f.   Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures.
      g.   Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems so as to
prevent the entrance of flood waters.
      h.   Pumping facilities for subsurface external foundation wall and
basement floor pressures.
      i.   Construction designed to resist rupture or collapse caused by water
pressure or floating debris.
      j.   Cut-off valves on sewer lines or the elimination of gravity flow
basement drains.
      k.   Elevation of structures or uses.
      l.   Bank protection or armor plating on any proposed fill.
      m.   Use of flood resistant materials and flood resistant utility
equipment.
E.   Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction

and development in an area of special flood hazards including floodway fringe
areas. No development, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses shall
be permitted which, acting alone or in combination with existing or future
uses, create a danger or hazard to life or property. All construction methods
used must be demonstrated to minimize potential flood damage.
   1.   Fill
      a.   Any fill proposed to be deposited in special flood hazard areas,
including floodway fringe areas, must be shown to have some beneficial purpose
and the amount thereof not greater than is necessary to achieve that purpose,
as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the owner showing the uses to which the
filled land will be put and the final dimensions of the proposed fill or other
materials.
      b.   Such fill or other materials shall be protected against erosion by
rip-rap, vegetative cover, bulkheading, or other approved methods.

around structures on slopes guide flood waters around and away from proposed or
existing structures.
      c.   Elevation and Floodproofing
         (1)   Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the regulatory
flood elevation, provided, however, new construction or substantial improvement
of any structure in Zone AO shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
higher than the adjacent grade at least one foot higher than the depth number
on the FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified.
         (2)   Upon completion of the structure, certification by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor that the elevation requirements of the lowest
floor, including basement of this section have been satisfied shall be provided
to the Floodplain Administrator for verification.
         (3)   Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in
conformance with Section
151.22.029.E.2.c.1, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
            (a)   Be floodproofed so that below the regulatory flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
            (b)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
            (c)   Upon completion of the structure, certification by a
registered professional engineer or surveyor that the elevation requirements of
the lowest floor, including basement, of this section have been satisfied shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator for verification; or certification
by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing
standards of this section are satisfied shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator for verification.
         (4)   Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements
of non- residential structures, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest
floor that are useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            (a)   A minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed
area that have a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
            (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot
above grade.
            (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and

the floodplain fringe provided that excavations are not so located nor of such
depth, or width, or length, or combination of depth-width- length as to present
a hazard to structures (including, but not limited to, roads, bridges,
culverts, and utilities), to banks of watercourses, or other property or which
adversely affect groundwater recharge.
      b.   There shall be no stockpiling of material or tailings that may
obstruct, divert, or retard the flow of floodwaters.
      c.   In addition to those conditions provided for elsewhere, Floodplain
Use Permits for excavations may impose conditions regarding the area and
location in which excavations are allowed the maximum amount of material to be
excavated and other reasonable restraints on the methods of operation including
time restraints.
   4.   Standards for Storage of Materials and Equipment
      a.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal
or plant life is prohibited.
      b.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject
to major damage by floods, and if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
   5.   Standards for Utilities
      a.   All new or replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the system and discharge from systems into flood waters.
      b.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      c.   Waste disposal systems shall not be installed wholly or partially in
a regulatory floodway.
   6.   Standards for Subdivisions. Land physically unsuitable for subdivision
because of severe flooding, drainage, or erosion problems endangering life or
property, shall not be subdivided unless it can be developed in such a way so
as to alleviate those problems.
      a.   Delineation of areas subject to flooding on plats and development
plans.
         (1)   All preliminary plats and development plans submitted shall show
location, by survey or photographic methods, of streams watercourses, canals,
irrigation laterals, private ditches, culverts, lakes and other water features,
including those areas subject to sheet flooding. All preliminary subdivision
proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base
flood.
         (2)   All preliminary plats and development plans shall show proposed
improvements for areas which are subject to flooding, including a description
and location of all facilities proposed to be used to alleviate flooding or
drainage problems, both on the proposed subdivision or development, and
downstream and upstream of any watercourse affected by the subdivision or
development, whether they are within or outside the boundaries of the
subdivision.
      b.   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special
flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood.
      c.   All final plats and development plans shall provide limits of the
100-year floodplain and the floodway delineated in a surveyable manner. All
final subdivision plans will provide the elevation(s) of proposed structure(s)
and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood, the final lowest floor
and pad elevation shall be certified by a State of Arizona registered
professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      d.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      e.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
      f.   All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure
to flood hazards and minimize flood damage.
   7.   Building Sites. Land which contains area within a floodplain shall not
be platted for residential occupancy or building sites unless each lot contains
a building site, either natural or man-made, which is not subject to flooding
by the Base Flood.
      a.   In areas subject to flooding where no fill is proposed to be used,
the building line shall be located no closer to the floodplain than the edge of
the area subject to flooding by the Base Flood.
   8.   Setback from Channels. Along reaches of streams or water courses where
hazards from eroding banks and/or channel meandering are considered by the
Floodplain Administrator to be severe, special engineering studies shall be
made by the property owner or developer and requirements for setback from banks
of streams or water courses and/or other protection measure shall be
established in accordance with findings that are concurred with by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   9.   Right-of-Way for Drainage. Whenever any stream, watercourse or major
watercourse, or major surface drainage course is located in the area being
subdivided, right-of-way encompassing each side of the stream, watercourse, or
drainage course, and the bed and banks of the stream, watercourse or drainage
course shall be provided for the purpose of widening, deepening, aligning,
improving, or protecting the stream or water course or for allowing for the
natural meander of the stream or water course as may be reasonably expected, or
for all of these to an extent determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
   10.   Detention/Retention Systems. When deemed necessary by the Floodplain
Administrator, flood detention/retention system shall be employed in lieu of or
in combination with structural flood control measures to reduce flooding
potential or restrict it to a level no greater than pre-platting and/or pre-
development conditions.
   11.   Standards for Manufactured Homes and Manufactured Home Parks and
Subdivisions. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved
shall:
      a.   Be elevated so that the bottom of the structural frame or the lowest
point of any attached appliances, whichever is lower, is at or above the
regulatory flood elevation; and
      b.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and Local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
   12.   Standards for Recreational Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed
on site will either:
      a.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions, or
      b.   Meet the permit requirements of Section
151.22.029.D of this Code and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
manufactured homes in Section
151.22.029.E.11.
   13.   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
Section
151.22.029.C.2 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
      a.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a State
of Arizona registered professional engineer or architect is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      b.   If Section
151.22.029.E.13.a is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of Section
151.22.029.E.
      c.   Except as provided for in this section, no other use shall be
allowed in any floodway. The following open space uses shall be permitted
within the floodway to the extent that they are not prohibited by any provision
of this section or any other ordinance, law, or regulation and provided they do
not require structures, fill, excavations, or the storage of materials or
equipment:
         (1)   Agricultural uses, including general farming, pasture, grazing
outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, and sod farming.
         (2)   Private and public recreational uses, including golf courses,
tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching
ramps, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet
ranges, hunting and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding trails.
   14.   Flood-Related Erosion-Prone Area
      a.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed
construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas
as known to the community.
      b.   Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the
proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-
related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise
aggravate the existing hazard.
      c.   If a proposed development is found to be in the path of flood-
related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvements shall
be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid
aggravating the existing erosion hazard.
   15.   Detention/Retention Systems. Drainage basins unsuitable for added
development because of the high probability of increased flooding or flooding
of existing improvements or properties not previously flooded, may be developed
further only upon the incorporation of adequate detention/retention systems as
reviewed and approved by the Floodplain Administrator. These systems shall be
incorporated into any and all future basin development proposals. For the
purpose of this provision, drainage basins shall refer to tributary basins to
any major watercourse for which the base discharge and its associated
floodplain have been established. In addition to this provision, the following
items shall be considered:
      a.   If a drainage basin is determined to be a "balanced" basin,
detention or retention systems shall be employed. The purpose of such systems
in "balanced" basins will be limiting the flood peak discharges from the site
to values no greater than pre-developed conditions. A "balanced" basin is one
which has the potential for a severe increase in flood hazards as a result of
increased development within the basin.
      b.   If a drainage basin is determined to be a "critical" basin,
detention or retention systems shall be employed. The purpose of such systems
in a "critical" basin shall be to reduce the potential flood hazard through the
detention or retention of storm runoff in fair and equitably apportioned
increments. A "critical" basin is one which already contains severe flood
problems related to existing runoff potential.
The design of a detention or retention system, as reviewed and approved by the
Floodplain Administrator shall include consideration of the degree of existing
development within the basin and the capacity of the downstream drainage
facilities. All flood control measures will be appropriate for the downstream
conditions and will terminate at an equally appropriate downstream release
point. The detention/retention systems will be designed with strict conformance
to the public's health, safety, and welfare. The effects of recharging storm
runoff and possible pollution of the groundwater shall be evaluated for all
systems employing infiltration systems, such as dry wells, in order to prevent
contamination of the ground water aquifer.
Structural flood control measures may be used in conjunction with or in place
of a detention/retention system if it can be clearly demonstrated that such
measures shall accomplish, with an equal or greater degree of success, the
function of such a system. Appropriate structural flood control measures, such
as channelization to a logical conclusion downstream of the proposed
development and/or improvements to existing off-site flood control systems
within the affected drainage or stream reach, shall be completed in accordance
with plans reviewed and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   16.   Appeals. Any property owner wishing to appeal a decision concerning
the interpretation or administration of this section shall first appeal in
writing to the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator may hold
hearings and request such additional information as he or she deems necessary
in order to render his or her decision. Said decision shall be stated in
writing and mailed to the property owner at the address listed on his or her
appeal.
Any property owner aggrieved by the decision of the Floodplain Administrator
may appeal to the Floodplain Board within 30 days of the date written notice of
the decision of the Floodplain Administrator is mailed to the property owner.
Upon receipt of the appeal, in proper form, the Floodplain Board shall hold a
public hearing upon the appeal not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days
after the filing. The appeal shall contain a detailed explanation of all
matters in dispute, and the Board may require the submission of such additional
information as it deems necessary.
The Board shall render its decision within 30 days of the close of the hearing.
F.   Variance Procedure
   1.   Nature of Variances. The variance criteria set forth in this section of
the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances
pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may
be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual
that complying with the requirements of this Code would create an exceptional
hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The
characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the
structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
It is the duty of the City of Sierra Vista to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious
that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this Code are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must by met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   2.   Appeal Board
      a.   The Board of the City of Sierra Vista shall hear and decide appeals
and requests for variances from the requirements of this Code.
      b.   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is
an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Code.
      c.   In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this Code, and:
         (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (2)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         (9)   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and,
         (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system, streets, and bridges.
      d.   Upon consideration of the factors of Section
151.22.029.F.2.c and the purposes of this Code, the Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this Code.
      e.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a floodplain administrator that:
         (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and
         (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as
required in Section
151.22.029.F.2.f of this Article. Such notice will also state that the land
upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of land
pursuant to any flood relocation and land exchange program. A copy of the
notice shall be recorded by the Board in the office of the Cochise County
Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.
      f.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the FEMA.
   3.   Conditions for Variances
      a.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of ½ acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the procedures of Sections 151.22.029.D and E
of this Code have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond ½
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      b.   Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      c.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      d.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      e.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (1)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of, the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
         (4)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon granting of a variance, permit or waiver for the construction of a
dwelling unit or commercial or industrial structure is otherwise contrary to
this section, the Board shall provide written notice to the grantees of such
variance, permit, or waiver that, if the structure is a dwelling unit or
business as defined by A.R.S. 26-321, the land upon which the structure is
located is ineligible for exchange of State land pursuant to the flood
relocation and land exchange program provided for by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter
2, Article 2. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Board in the office
of the Cochise County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it
appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

Section 151.23.001 Definition
Planned Area Development or "PAD" shall mean a parcel of land, or contiguous
parcels of land, of a size sufficient to accommodate an integrally planned
environment, controlled by a single landowner, or by a group of landowners in
common agreement as to the control, to be developed as a single entity, the
scale and uses of which are compatible with adjacent parcels, and the intent of
the zoning or districts in which the project is located. Common open space is
an essential element of any PAD.
(Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.002 Purpose
A.   The purpose of a PAD is to permit great design flexibility and,
consequently, more creative and imaginative design for development than
generally is possible under conventional zoning and subdivision regulations. It
is intended that planned developments built pursuant to this section include
the following objectives:
   1.   To ensure such developments are compatible, both in substance and
location, with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan and/or other
specific adopted area or neighborhood plans;
   2.   To promote flexibility and quality in design and to permit
diversification in the location, type, and uses of structures;
   3.   To promote the efficient use of land by means of more economical
arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities;
   4.   To preserve to the greatest extent possible the existing landscape
features and amenities and to encourage the harmonious combination of such
features with structures and other improvements;
   5.   To provide for useable and suitability located recreation facilities
and other public and common facilities;
   6.   To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms and
building relationships within the PADs in concert with adjacent and surrounding
land and development; and
   7.   To ensure a high quality of development within the City.
B.   Deviation from specific site development standards is allowable as long as
the general purposes for the standards are achieved and the general provisions
of the zoning regulations are observed. The planned approach is appropriate if
it maintains compatibility with the surrounding area and creates an attractive,
healthful, efficient, and stable environment. It should either promote a
harmonious variety of grouping of uses, or utilize the economy of shared
services and facilities.
('76 Code, Art. 12-1) (Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.003 Site Locations
A PAD for residential use may be established in all of the residential
districts as provided in this Code according to the conditions set out in this
Article; provided, however, that the design of the proposed PAD must be equal
or superior to the design which would result under the existing conventional
zoning requirements for the parcel.
PADs for other than residential use may be established in the office-
professional, commercial and industrial districts as provided in this Code. If
a proposed project requires rezoning, a request may be considered by the
Commission concurrently with its consideration of preliminary approval of the
development plan.
('76 Code, Art. 12-1) (Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.004 Site Development Standards
A.   Minimum Project Area. In a PAD, there shall be no minimum site size.
B.   Minimum Dimensions. The minimum lot area, width, frontage, and yard
requirements otherwise applying to individual buildings in the zone in which a
PAD is proposed do not apply within a PAD except as hereinafter provided.
C.   Peripheral Setbacks. Along project boundaries, the required front, side or
rear yards shall be the same as those required by Section
151.15.005 of this Code.
D.   Open Area; Landscaping. A minimum of 25 percent of the gross lot area
shall be developed as permanent open space. The minimum open area of all sites
shall be landscaped and permanently maintained in accordance with
Article 151.15. Landscaping shall primarily consist of groundcover, ferns,
trees, shrubs, and/or other living plants, and with sufficient permanent
irrigation installation to properly maintain all vegetation. Decorative design
elements such as fountains, pools, benches, sculptures, planters, and similar
elements may be placed within the area. These provisions shall apply to all new
projects and to an addition or remodeling of an existing structure that creates
new dwelling units. The required open space shall be designed and arranged to
offer the maximum benefits to the occupants of the development as well as
provide visual appeal and building separation. The open area may be allocated
as follows:
Private open space designated for the exclusive use of individual dwelling
units such as patio areas and balconies of at least 60 square feet with a
minimum dimension of 6 feet may be included as part of the required open space
and be given credit for 2-square feet of required open area for each 1-square
foot so provided, not to exceed 200-square feet of total open space credit for
any one dwelling unit.
Required open space does not include:
   1.   Balconies. Balconies that are required for entrances or exits shall not
be considered as open space except where such exits or entrances are for the
sole use of the unit.
   2.   Roofed Structures. Allocated open space shall not include roofed or
enclosed structures, except for open unclosed private patios or balconies.
   3.   Driveways and Parking. Open space shall not include vehicular
circulation areas such as driveways, driveway easements, or open parking areas.
E.   Building Heights. The maximum building height for all uses within any PAD
shall be those heights set by the respective zoning district in which the PAD
is located.
F.   Separation between Structures/Setback Requirements. To provide privacy,
air, and access to the dwelling within the development, the minimum separation
of structures/setbacks from property lines consistent with the applicable
provisions of the International Building Code shall be maintained.
G.   Private Local Streets in a Planned Area Development. Streets in a PAD
shall be developed in accordance with the provisions of Section
151.08.003.C.
('76 Code, Art. 12-1) (Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.005 Project Density
A.   The density of any PAD shall not exceed the permitted density of the
district within which the PAD is to be located by more than 15 percent. The
density for any planned residential project shall not exceed 30 dwelling units
per net acre.
B.   In order to encourage a variety of housing types and the provision of
lower cost housing, a density bonus of 5 percent may be obtained in any
residential development under one of the following conditions:
   1.   In a planned residential development containing 30 or more dwelling
units where there is a price variation of at least 25 percent and where at
least 15 percent of said units are priced so as to be available for low or
moderate income families.
   2.   In a PAD providing substantial public benefit. Substantial public
benefit shall mean the provision of public facilities that are both unusual in
character and serve the needs of an area greater than the immediate
development. No density bonus may be approved unless the public facilities
provided are in excess of the typically required street improvements,
sidewalks, bike paths and drainage facilities.
SPECIAL NOTE: In no case shall the density of a PAD exceed the permitted
density of the district by more than 20 percent.
C.   If the Council finds that any of the following conditions would be created
by an increase in density permitted by this section, it may either prohibit any
increase in density or limit the increase in density by an amount which is
sufficient to avoid the creation of any of these conditions:
   1.   Inconvenient or unsafe access to the PAD.
   2.   Traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the PAD.
   3.   An excessive burden on sewerage, water supply, parks, recreational
areas, schools or other public facilities which serve, or are proposed to
serve, the PAD.
The applicant shall, prior to receiving a public hearing on the preliminary
plan, either: (a) adjust his plan to conform to appropriate densities; or (b)
submit proposals for correction deficiencies in support facilities and
services.
(Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.006 Component Uses
A.   In a PAD containing 100 or more dwelling units and a minimum site area of
5 acres up to 3,000 square feet per 100 dwelling units may be used for
component uses. These are private or public non-residential uses established
primarily for the needs of the PAD residents. This component area may be in a
separate building or incorporated within a two-family or multi-family
structure. The following requirements shall be met before such component use
may be incorporated:
   1.   The structure, if separate, shall be of an architectural design
compatible with that of the dwelling units.
   2.   Off-street parking and loading requirements shall be determined as
appropriate to the particular case based upon the types of establishments
permitted and the anticipated proportion of walk-in trade, and in accordance
with
Article 151.09 of this Code.
   3.   All merchandise or supplies shall be stored or displayed inside a
completely enclosed building.
   4.   All signs shall be of a style of construction and design compatible
with the character of the PAD. Signs shall be limited to one identification
sign for each point of access to the component use. The sign shall not exceed
4-square feet in area, shall not be directly lighted, shall be attached flat
against the face of the building and, if illuminated, shall have internal
illumination.
(Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.007 Management of Common Properties
A.   PAD shall be approved subject to the establishment by the developer of a
homeowners' association or other cooperative organization responsible for the
ownership and permanent care and maintenance of any common open spaces,
recreational areas, and communally-owned facilities designed for the benefit of
the residents of the development. An instrument approved by the City specifying
the responsibility for the maintenance of any common properties shall be
properly recorded with the Cochise County Recorder. The instrument shall be in
the form of a deed restriction or covenant, enforceable jointly or separately,
by the homeowners' association or other cooperative organization, or property
owners in the site and shall:
   1.   Run with the land; and
   2.   Provide reasonable standards for maintenance and facilities in the
common area; and
   3.   Provide for assessments or other payments as necessary to cover costs
of maintenance, management and improvements; and
   4.   Provide for a homeowners' association or other cooperative organization
for administrative and management purposes.
B.   The provisions of the homeowners' association or other cooperative
organization shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
   1.   The association or other organization shall be established prior to the
sale of any dwelling unit.
   2.   The association or other organization charger shall be renewed in
accordance with state laws as long as the property use remains.
   3.   Membership shall be mandatory for each home-buyer and successive buyer.
   4.   The open space restrictions shall be initially set for a period of at
least 50 years.

   1.   Conceptual Review.
   2.   Master Plan (if the development is to be phased).
   3.   Preliminary Plan.
   4.   Final Plan. The concept plan is the applicant's impression expressed
graphically of the anticipated pattern of development for which a particular
parcel of land and from which a preliminary or master plan is developed. The
purpose of the master plan is to establish general planning and development
control parameters while allowing sufficient flexibility to permit detailed
planning at the time of development.
The preliminary plan shall generally specify the uses of land and layout of
landscaping, circulation and buildings. The final plan is the document on which
building permits and other City approvals are issued and shall require detailed
engineering plan review and approval.
B.   Conceptual Review
   1.   This is an opportunity for applicants to discuss with the City staff
the requirements, standards and policies that apply to development proposals.
Major problems can be identified and solved before a formal application is
presented.
   2.   The general outline of the proposal, evidenced schematically by sketch
plans, shall be submitted by the applicant and reviewed by the City.

Article 151.10.
(Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.010 Significance of Approval
A.   Preliminary PAD Plan. Preliminary PAD Plan approval allows the subdivider
to proceed with submittal of a Final PAD Plan. Preliminary approval is valid
for a period of 12 months from date and may be extended once at the discretion
of the Commission for six months from the expiration date of original approval,
upon written request of the developer prior to the expiration of approval. If
approval expires prior to submittal of the Final PAD Plan and improvements
plans, the Preliminary PAD Plan shall be resubmitted for approval as a new case
and a new fee paid.
B.   Final PAD Plan. Final PAD Plan approval, along with approval of building
plans from the Director of Community Development, allows the developer to
receive building permits and begin construction of the PAD. If no building
permits have been received for the PAD development within 12 months from the
final PAD approval, approval may be extended once at the discretion of the
Commission for six months from the expiration date upon written request of the
developer prior to expiration of approval. If approval expires prior to any
building permits being received for the development, then approval shall become
null and void and a new submittal shall be required.
('76 Code, Art. 12-1) (Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.011 Building Permits
For the purpose of implementing a PAD, building permits may be issued for
buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved Final PAD Plan if
they are in conformity with the Final PAD Plan and with all other applicable
ordinances and regulations.
   1.   Once a Final PAD Plan has been approved and recorded, it can be
amended, changed or modified only through the procedure prescribed herein for
the initial application for approval.
   2.   A development schedule for residential uses may be submitted as part of
the project plan, and the construction and provision of all of the common open
spaces and public recreational facilities which are shown on the Final PAD Plan
must proceed at the same rate as the construction of dwelling units. If the
Director of Community Development should find that the rate of dwelling unit
construction is greater than the rate at which common open areas and public and
recreational facilities are being constructed or provided, he shall notify the
developer that no permits for dwelling unit construction will be issued until
the rate of construction conforms to the development schedule.
   3.   The development schedule may provide for staged construction of the
Final PAD Plan. Building permits will not be issued for any stage of the final
plan unless the common open space allocated to that stage by the development
schedule has been conveyed to the appropriate parties.
(Ord. 743, passed 4-10-86)
Section 151.23.012 Control of the Planned Area Development After Completion
The Final PAD Plan shall continue to control the PAD after it is finished and
the following shall apply:
   1.   The Director of Community Development, in issuing a certificate of
completion of the PAD, shall note the issuance of the recorded Final PAD Plan.
   2.   After the certificate of completion has been issued, the use of the
land and the construction, modification or alteration of a building or
structure within the PAD shall be governed by the approved Final PAD Plan.
   3.   After the certificate of completion has been issued, no change shall be
made in development contrary to the approved Final PAD Plan without approval of
an amendment to the plan except as follows:
      a.   Minor modifications of existing buildings or structures may be
authorized by the Director of Community Development if they are consistent with
the purposes and intent of the final plan and do not increase the cubic footage
of a building or structure.
      b.   A building or structure that is totally or substantially destroyed
may be reconstructed without approval of an amended PAD if it is in compliance
with the purpose and intent of the Final PAD Plan.
   4.   An amendment to a completed PAD may be approved if it is required for
the continued success of the PAD, if it is appropriate because of changes in
conditions that have occurred since the final development plan was approved, or
because there have been changes in the development policy of the community as
reflected by the comprehensive plan or related land use regulations.
   5.   No modification or amendment to a completed PAD is to be considered as
a waiver of the covenants limiting the use of the land, buildings, structures
and improvements within the area of the PAD; and all rights to enforce these
covenants against any change permitted by this section are expressly reserved.

Sections:
   
151.24.001   Purpose
   
151.24.002   Classification and Continuance of Non-Conformance
Section 151.24.001 Purpose
A.   Purpose. Within the districts established by this Code or amendments that
may later be adopted, there exists:
   (a)   lots,
   (b)   structures,
   (c)   uses of land and structures, and
   (d)   signs which were lawful before this Code was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this
Code or future amendment. It is the intent of this Code to permit these non-
conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this Code that non-conformities shall not
be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
Non-conforming uses are declared by this Code to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure; a non-
conforming use of land; or a non-conforming use of structure and land in
combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Code by the
addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the
district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Code and upon which actual building construction has been
carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction,
provided that work shall be carried on diligently.

A.   Non-Conforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Code, not withstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this Code. Such lot must be separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall
apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or
both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard
dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or
both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which
such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only
through the process as determined in Article 151.30.
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Code, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Code, and no
portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Code, nor
shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area
below the requirements stated in this Code.
B.   Non-Conforming Uses of Land. Where, at the time of passage or amendment of
this Code, lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this Code, and where such use involves no individual
structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000, the use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
   1.   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater use of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Code;
   2.   No such non-conforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of the adoption or amendment of this Code.
   3.   If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-
year period, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this Code for the district in which such land is located.
   4.   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Code
shall be erected in connection with such non-conforming use of land.
C.   Non-Conforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code that could not be built
under the terms of this Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the
structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   1.   No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its non-conformity;
   2.   Should such non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except
in conformity with the provisions of this Code.
   3.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
D.   Non-Conforming Uses of Structures. If lawful use involving individual
structures with a replacement cost of $1,000 or more, or of structure and
premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Code, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
   1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Code in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
   2.   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Code, but no such use shall be extended to occupy
any land outside such building.
   3.   Any structure or structure and land in combination in or on which a
non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
   4.   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18
months during any three year period (except when government action access to
the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall
not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
   5.   Where non-conforming use status is applied to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
non- conforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the
replacement cost at time of destruction.
E.   Non-Conforming Signs. Within 90 days after the effective date of this
Code, the owner of any existing sign shall make application to the Director of
Community Development for a Zoning Compliance Certificate for each existing
sign owned, such application to include size, location, type of structural
materials and subject matter.
Any roof, wall or projecting sign, or any ground sign having its principal
structural members of metal or concrete, which lawfully existed at the
effective date of this Code or upon annexation, and which does not conform to
all requirements of this Code for the district in which it is located, shall be
considered legally non-conforming and may be continued and maintained;
provided, however, that such sign shall not be enlarged, increased in area or
height, or relocated, except in conformity with this Code. Upon annexation,
only those signs which lawfully existed at the effective date of annexation
shall be considered legally non-conforming. On property having multiple street
frontages, no additional signage shall be permitted at any location on that
property when the aggregate area of existing signs exceeds that permitted by
this Code,
Article 151.10. of this Code notwithstanding.
Any ground sign which is structurally supported by wooden or other non-
permanent materials may be continued and maintained for a period not exceeding
two years from the effective date of this Code, whereupon it shall either have
been brought into conformity with all regulations of the district in which it
is located, or shall have been removed from the premises.
   1.   Should such non-conforming sign or non-conforming portion of a sign be
destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement
cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity
with the provisions of this code.
   2.   Should such sign be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved.
   3.   When a non-conforming sign and premises in combination is discontinued
or abandoned for 12 consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year
period (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the sign
shall thereafter be removed and may not be replaced except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   4.   Upon written request for consideration from the owner of the property
where such discontinued or abandoned non-conforming use exists to the Director
of Community Development, the Director may grant a one-time extension,
extending the discontinued or abandoned provision of this section for a period
not exceeding 12 months.
F.   Repairs and Maintenance. On any non-conforming structure or portion of a
structure containing a non-conforming use, work may be done in any period of 12
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-
bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10
percent of the current replacement cost of the non-conforming structure or non-
conforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the
cubic content existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased.
If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-
conforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and
maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or
unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored,
repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
G.   Record of Non-Conformance. The Director of Community Development shall,
immediately after the effective date of this Code, survey and make a complete
record of all cases of non-conformance, and maintain such record thereafter,
reviewing each case annually or as often as the Council may prescribe. Such
record shall include the name and address of owner and occupant, if other than
the owner, legal description of the property and classification and description
of the non-conformance. The Director of Community Development shall inform the
owner of such property by certified mail as to the classification and nature of
the non-conformity and the regulations applicable to its continuance; such
record shall constitute prima facie evidence of the number, character, and
extent of non-conformance existing at the effective date of this Code or any
subsequent amendment.

Section 151.26.001 Purpose
Each district in the City contains designated permitted uses as a matter of
right. In addition to the designated uses in each district, there are
conditional uses, neither absolutely permitted as a right nor prohibited by
law, which may be compatible within the district. These are privileges, in a
sense, and must be applied for and approved by the City.
It is the intent of this Article to provide a set of procedures and standards
for conditional uses of land or structures which, because of their unique
characteristics relative to locational features, design, size, operation,
circulation, and public interest or service require special consideration in
relation to the welfare of adjacent properties and the community as a whole. It
is the purpose of the regulations and standards set forth below to:
A.   Allow, on one hand, practical latitude for use of land and structures, but
at the same time maintain adequate provision for the protection of the health,
safety, convenience, and general welfare of the community and adjacent
properties; and
B.   Provide for periodic review of Conditional Use Permits to provide for
further conditions to more adequately assure conformity of such uses to the
public welfare.

Section 151.26.002 Conditional Uses
Conditional uses shall be those established by the Matrix of Use Permissions by
Zoning District under Section
151.22.006 of this Code and shall be subject to the approval procedures of this
Article.

Section 151.26.003 Review Considerations
A.   In permitting a new conditional use or the alteration of an existing
conditional use, the Council can impose, in addition to those standards and
requirements expressly specified by this Code, additional conditions which it
finds necessary to avoid a detrimental environmental impact and to otherwise
protect the best interest of the surrounding area or the community as a whole.
These conditions can include, but are not limited to, the following:
   1.   Limiting the manner in which the use is conducted, including
restricting the time a certain activity can take place and restraints to
minimize such environmental effects as noise, vibration, air pollution, glare,
and odor.
   2.   Establishing special yard, open space, lot area, or dimensional
requirements.
   3.   Limiting the height, size, or location of a building or other structure
or use.
   4.   Designating the size, number, location, and nature of vehicle access
points.
   5.   Designating the size, location, screening, drainage, surfacing, or
other improvements of a parking area or loading area.
   6.   Limiting or otherwise designating the number, size, location, height,
and lighting of signs.
   7.   Limiting the intensity of outdoor lighting and requiring light
shielding.
   8.   Requiring diking, screening, landscaping, or another facility to
protect adjacent or nearby property and designate standards for its
installation and maintenance.
   9.   Designating the size, height, location of screening, and materials of
fencing.
   10.   Protecting and preserving existing trees, vegetation, water resources,
wildlife habitat, or another significant natural resource.

conformance with the remainder of the specific plan, with the City of Sierra
Vista General Plan, and with other applicable land use plans that have been
adopted by the city.
C.   Procedure.
   1.   The owner(s) or agent of the property may submit to the Director of
Community Development a written application to amend one or more of the
specific plan regulations.
   2.   The request shall be accompanied by documentation of unforeseen changes
in the marketplace, governmental regulations, or natural conditions that have
occurred since plan adoption which have necessitated an amendment.
   3.   The Director of Community Development shall determine if the amendment
would result in a substantial change in plan regulations, which is a change in:
      a.   Density regulation, if the number of residences per acre increased
by more than 10 percent or exceeds the maximum number of dwelling units
(dwelling-unit cap) permitted within the plan; or
      b.   Policy regulation, when the regulation is a policy or a variation of
a policy contained in an applicable land use plan; or
      c.   Design regulation, when change is to be made to quantified physical
dimensions (such as buffers) that were established to adapt the plan to
specific site characteristics or to mitigate development impacts on the site
and surrounding area; or
      d.   Use regulation, when a use not otherwise permitted in the Specific
Plan is sought.
A substantial change may require, as determined necessary by the Director of
Community Development, submittal of an amended Site and Area Analysis Report.
   4.   If the request is determined not to be a substantial change, the
proposed amendment shall require a public hearing and action by the Council. In
addition, the Council may refer any amendment request to the Commission for its
recommendation prior to taking action.
   5.   If the request is determined to be a substantial change, the Director
of Community Development shall refer the request to the Commission for a public
hearing and recommendation prior to public hearing by the Council. Both
hearings shall follow notice requirements as set forth in Section
151.27.004.A of this Code.
D.   Protest. If the owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the
lots included in a proposed change, or of those immediately adjacent in the
rear or any side extending 300 feet, or of those directly opposite extending
300 feet from the street frontage of the opposite lots, file a protest in
writing against a proposed amendment, it shall not become effective except by
the favorable vote of not less than six members of the Council.
If the Mayor or any member of the Council is unable to vote on such a question
because of conflict of interest, then the required number of votes for passage
of the question shall be 3/4 of the remaining membership of the City Council,
provided that such required number of votes shall in no event be less than a
majority (4) of the full membership of the Council.

A.   Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is error in any
order, requirement or decision made by the Director of Community Development or
the Development Review Committee in the enforcement of the Code.
B.   Hear and decide appeals for variances from the terms of this Code only if,
because of special circumstances applicable to the property including its size,
shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of the
Code will deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other property of the
same classification in the same district. Any variance granted is subject to
such conditions as will assure that the adjustment authorized shall not
constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon
other properties in the vicinity and in which such property is located.
C.   Reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement or
decision of the Director of Community Development appealed from, and make such
order, requirement, decision, or determination as necessary.

Section 151.30.004 Limitations on the Powers of the Hearing Officer
The Hearing Officer may not make any changes in the uses permitted in any
district, nor make any changes in the terms of this Code provided the

Section 151.30.005 Variances
Upon appeal in specific cases, the Hearing Officer shall authorize such
variances from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this Code would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance shall
not be granted by the Hearing Officer unless and until:
A.   A written application for variance is submitted demonstrating:
   1.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district; and,
   2.   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed under the terms of this Code
by other properties in the same district; and,
   3.   That the alleged hardships caused by literal interpretation of the
provisions of this Code do not result from the actions of the applicant; and,
   4.   That granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this Code to other lands, structures or
buildings in the same district; and,
   5.   That granting the variance requested will not interfere or injure the
rights of other properties in the same district.
B.   A public hearing has been held.
C.   The Hearing Officer finds that the reasons set forth in the application
justify the granting of the variance and that the variance is the minimum
variance that will make possible the reasonable use of land, building or
structure.
D.   The Hearing Officer finds that granting of the variance will be in harmony
with the general purpose and intent of this Code and the General Plan and will
not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare.
(Ord. 2005-003, passed 1-13-05)

notice. In addition to persons who receive notice as required by the matter
under consideration, the City may provide notice to others if it has reason to
believe that they are affected or otherwise represent an interest that may be
affected by the proposed interpretation or variance.

Section 151.30.007 Public Hearing of Application by Hearing Officer
Every application shall be considered by the Hearing Officer at a public

the hearing; and,
      b.   The evidence is now available to the person seeking to reopen the
hearing; and,
      c.   The evidence is factual, substantial, and material. If the hearing
is closed, no further evidence shall be received except in response to specific

The opportunity for brief rebuttal shall also be afforded to adverse parties.
C.   Rules of Procedure
   1.   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply.

writings received after the close of the hearing will be considered as
argument.

preserved and shall be transmitted to an appellate body in the event an appeal
is filed in accordance with Section

the burden upon the proponent. The proposal must be supported by proof that it
conforms to the applicable elements of the General Plan and to applicable
provisions of this Code, especially the specific criteria set forth for the
particular type of decision under consideration.
B.   Order of Proceedings
   1.   The presiding officer will state the case and call the public hearing
to order. The presiding officer may establish the time allowed for the
presentation of information.
   2.   Any objections or jurisdictional grounds shall be noted in the record.
   3.   Any abstentions or disqualification shall be determined. Members shall
announce all conflicts of interest.
   4.   Presentation of staff report. City staff may also present additional
information, whenever allowed by the presiding officer, during the proceedings.
   5.   The Commission and Council may view the area in dispute for purposes of
evaluating the proposal, but shall state the place, time, manner, and
circumstances of such viewing in the record.
   6.   Presentation of information by the applicant or those representing the
applicant.
   7.   Presentation of evidence or inquiries by those persons who support the
proposal.
   8.   Presentation of evidence or inquiries by those persons who oppose the
proposal.
   9.   Presentation of evidence or inquiries by those persons who do not
necessarily support or oppose the proposal.
   10.   Rebuttal testimony may be presented by persons who have testified
supporting or opposing the proposed change. The scope of material presented
during rebuttal shall be limited to matters that were brought up during the
course of the hearing.
      Rebuttal shall be first presented by the applicant or his representative
and then by those opposed to the proposed change. The presiding officer shall
limit rebuttal to avoid repetition and redundancy.
   11.   At the close of presentation of information, rebuttal, and written
argument, the presiding officer shall declare that the hearing is closed unless
there is a motion to continue the public hearing. Additional written argument
may be permitted at the discretion of the Commission and Council.
   12.   Once a hearing has been closed, it shall be reopened only upon a
majority vote of the Commission and Council and only after a reasonable showing
that:
      a.   There is evidence which was not reasonably available at the time of
the hearing; and
      b.   The evidence is now available to the person seeking to reopen the
hearing; and
      c.   The evidence is factual, substantial, and material. If the hearing
is closed, no further evidence shall be received except in response to specific
questions directed to staff or one of the parties to clarify earlier evidence.
The opportunity for brief rebuttal shall also be afforded to adverse parties.
C.   Rules of Procedure
   1.   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply.
   2.   Written exhibits, visual aids, affidavits, maps, and the like may be
submitted as part of the evidence. Any correspondence presented to or received
by any member of the Commission and/or Council, or by any other City agency or
official outside the public hearing, may be received as argument and placed in
the record, but will not be considered as part of the information, except that
correspondence received prior to the closing of the public hearing shall be
included as part of the information in that hearing. Unless the Commission or
Council specifically allows later filing of argument, no correspondence
received after the close of the hearing will be considered as argument.
   3.   All information received by the Commission and Council shall be
retained and preserved and shall be sent to an appellate body in the event an
appeal is filed in accordance with Section
151.31.006. True, certified, or recorded copies of original information may be
substituted for original documents.
   4.   All evidence and argument shall be as brief as possible, consistent
with full presentation.
   5.   Redundancy shall be avoided.
   6.   Each person presenting information or argument shall be permitted to
complete his presentation without interruption, except by the presiding
officer, to enforce this Code.
   7.   Discussion of personalities shall be avoided to the extent possible in
making a complete presentation.
   8.   No person present shall engage in applause, cheers, or other vocal or
outward expressions of approval or disapproval, agreement or disagreement. If
any person persists in such conduct after warning by the presiding officer,
such person may be expelled from the hearing.
   9.   The presiding officer has complete authority to enforce these
provisions to assure that a fair hearing is held, including the authority to
expel from the public hearing and to bar from further appearance at the public
hearing any person who willfully violates any one or more of these provisions.
D.   Findings. The Commission shall recommend approval, approval with
conditions, or denial of the request based on compliance with the following
findings.
   1.   Findings for Map Amendments:
      a.   The change is consistent with the General Plan goals and policies;
      b.   The change is consistent with the purpose of the Development Code to
promote the growth of the City in an orderly and sustainable manner and to
promote and protect the public health, safety, peace, comfort, and general
welfare;
      c.   The change is necessary to achieve the balance of land uses desired
by the City and to provide sites for needed housing or employment-generating
uses; and to increase the inventory of land within a given zoning district to
meet market demand.
   2.   Findings for Text Amendments:
      a.   Demonstrates the need and justification for the change; and,
      b.   Demonstrates the relationship of the proposed amendment to the
City's General Plan with appropriate consideration as to whether the proposed
change will further the purposes of this Code and other City ordinances and
regulations; and
      c.   Consistent with the purposes of the Development Code to promote the
growth of the City in an orderly and sustainable manner and to promote and
protect the public health, safety, peace, comfort, and general public welfare
and does not constitute a granting of special privileges to an individual
owner.
E.   After the hearing, the Commission shall render a decision in the form of a
written recommendation to the Council and to the applicant. The recommendation
shall include the reasons for the recommendation and be transmitted to the
Council and the applicant by the Director of Community Development.

Section 151.31.007 Council Hearings and Decision
A.   If the Commission has held a public hearing, the Council may adopt the
recommendations of the Commission without holding a second public hearing if
there is no objection, request for public hearing, or other protest.
B.   If an objection, request for public hearing, or other protest is formally
submitted, a public hearing shall be required before the Council. The public
hearing shall be advertised and meet the public notice requirements as stated

submitted no more than seven days after the Commission has rendered their
decision.
   a.   The Council shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
request. Any decision must include a determination on whether the request is

applicant of the action.
C.   The Council shall hold a public hearing should the Fort Huachuca
Encroachment Board provide comments or analysis concerning the compatibility of
the proposed Zoning District Map Amendment within the high noise or accident
potential generated by the military airport or ancillary military facility
operations, that may have an adverse impact on public health and safety. The
Council shall consider and analyze the comments or analysis before making a
final determination.

Section 151.31.008 Protests Against Amendments
If the owners of twenty percent or more of the property by area and number of
lots, tracts and condominium units within the zoning area of the affected
property, excluding government owned property, file a protest in writing
against a proposed amendment, the change shall not become effective except by
the favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the City Council. If any
members of the City Council are unable to vote on such a question because of a
conflict of interest, then the required number of votes for passage of the
question shall be three-fourths of the remaining membership of the City
Council, provided that such required number of votes shall not be less than a
majority of the full membership of the legally established City Council. For
the purposes of this subsection, the vote shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number. A protest filed pursuant to this subsection shall be signed by the
property owners, excluding government owned property, opposing the proposed
amendment and filed in the office of the clerk of the municipality not later
than 12:00 noon one business day before the date on which the City Council will
vote on the proposed amendment or on an earlier time and date established by
the City Council.
