CHAPTER 2-4.
COUNCIL PROCEDURE
2-4-1 Regular and special council meetings
A. All meetings of the council shall be public meetings and shall be conducted
in accordance with A.R.S. § 38-431 et seq. (the "open meeting law") and all
other federal, state and local laws. The council shall hold its regular
meetings on the first and third Tuesday of each month, except that when the day
fixed for any regular meeting of the council falls upon a day designated by law
as a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held on the next succeeding day which
is not a holiday, unless otherwise set by action of the council. Upon
consultation between the mayor and the town manager, any meeting which is
determined to be unnecessary may be cancelled. The town clerk shall issue a
notice of cancellation which shall be posted in the usual manner. Additional
meetings, including, without limitation, special meetings and study sessions,
shall be scheduled as needed upon request to the town clerk by the mayor, three
council members or the town manager. Additional meetings shall be noticed and
agendized in accordance with the provisions of this code and applicable state
statutes.
B. All meetings of the council shall be held at the Marana Town Hall, 11555
West Civic Center Drive, Marana, Arizona, unless otherwise designated.
C. Members of the council and the public shall be given at least 24 hours'
notice of all council meetings as set forth in the open meeting law, except in
the case of an actual emergency. Notice shall be posted on the town's website
and in such other locations as listed on the town's website and as are
reasonable and practicable. In the case of an actual emergency, a meeting may
be held upon such notice as is reasonable under the circumstances. Notice in
this paragraph is intended to mean a complete agenda of the meeting, including
the type of meeting, and the location, date and time of the meeting.
D. Written minutes shall be taken of each council meeting, and if recording
equipment is available, each council meeting shall also be recorded. These
provisions shall not apply to executive sessions, which are governed elsewhere
in this code.
Ordinance 2025.015 amended paragraph A to remove election day from automatic
rescheduling.
Ordinance 2012.09 amended section
2-4-1 to conform to open meeting law revisions and current council practice.
Ordinance 2011.08 amended paragraph A by establishing procedures to cancel and
reschedule meetings. Capitalizations in the last three sentences of paragraph A
were revised as scrivener’s errors by the town attorney by authority of section
1-4-5 to conform to the stylistic conventions set forth in Ordinance 2005.22
Ordinance 2005.22 revised the address
Ordinance 2005.22 deleted “tape” before “recorded”
2-4-2 Agenda preparation and distribution
A.   Agendas for town council meetings shall be prepared by the agenda
committee, which shall be made up of the mayor (or his or her designee), town
manager, town clerk, town attorney, and any other person designated by the
mayor or town manager. In the absence of the mayor, the vice mayor shall serve
in his or her stead. The agenda committee shall review, adjust and agree to the
items on each agenda. Although the agenda committee shall formulate each
agenda, the final determination of what will be placed on an agenda will be in
the sole discretion of the mayor, except as provided in the following
subsections.
B.   Notwithstanding the mayor’s discretion of what items to place on the
agenda, if three or more council members request an item to be placed on the
agenda, it must be placed upon the agenda for the second regular town council
meeting after the date of the request.
C.   Except in an emergency (as determined by the mayor or town manager), any
person desiring to place an item on the agenda shall prepare and deliver a
summary of the issue a reasonable time prior to the agenda committee meeting.
If the request is made by an employee or staff member, it shall be delivered to
the town manager, and if the request is made by a council member or member of
the public, it shall be delivered to any member of the agenda committee.
D.   All blue sheets, reports, communications, ordinances, resolutions,
contract documents, and other documents to be included in the “council packet”
shall be submitted to the town manager for review a reasonable time prior to
the agenda committee meeting, and the town manager will work with the
department preparing the materials to ensure that all final materials are
submitted to the town clerk or his or her designee prior to the final
preparation of the council packet. The final agenda will be prepared by the
town clerk, approved as to form by the town attorney, and signed by the mayor
or, in his or her absence, the vice mayor. Council packets will be delivered to
all council members at least 24 hours prior to the council meeting. These
deadlines may be waived for any particular item by the mayor or town manager
only if it is determined that it is impossible to meet the deadline.
E.   The agenda format as approved by resolution of the council will generally
be used for all regular town council meetings, although variations may be made
from time to time. For special meetings, study sessions, and other meetings,
such as joint meetings with other entities, retreats, subcommittee meetings,
and task force meetings, a relaxed format may be used which excludes many of
the unnecessary items, as long as the format used complies with the open
meeting law.
F.   Agenda items requiring action by the council which are generally routine
items, not believed to be controversial, not requiring council discussion, or
issues already discussed or heard at public hearing for which final adoption by
resolution or ordinance is needed may be contained in a consent agenda. A
single motion and affirmative vote “to approve the consent agenda” will approve
all items in the consent agenda, including any resolutions or ordinances
included in the consent agenda. Prior to a motion to pass the consent agenda,
and upon the request of any council member, any item on the consent agenda can
be removed from the consent agenda and considered immediately following the
consent agenda. If the consent agenda is not passed, the council may discuss
and vote upon each item listed on the consent agenda immediately after the vote
fails to pass the consent agenda.
G.   In formulating the agenda, items for which there is attendance of
speakers, presenters or members of the public, may be placed higher on the
agenda to allow those individuals to leave after the item is completed.
Section 2-4-2 was rewritten by Ordinance 99.32
The wording of paragraph B was simplified by Ordinance 2005.22
Paragraph E was revised by Ordinances 2012.09 and 2005.22. The currently used
agenda format was approved by Resolution 2012-66, adopted on August 7, 2012.
Ordinance 2005.22 inserted “after the vote fails to pass the consent agenda”
for “thereafter”
2-4-3 Duties at meetings
A.   The mayor shall be the presiding officer of the council and the committee
chairman shall be the presiding officer of the committee. If the mayor is
absent, the vice mayor shall be the presiding officer until the return of the
mayor. If both the mayor and vice mayor are absent, the town clerk shall call
the meeting to order and a temporary presiding officer shall be elected by a
majority of those council members present, and that person shall serve until
the return of the mayor or vice mayor. Upon the return of the mayor or vice
mayor, the temporary presiding officer shall relinquish the chair when the
business immediately before the council is completed. The word “mayor” as used
in this section shall mean the presiding officer of the meeting.
B.   The mayor shall call the meeting to order, and lead or designate the
leading of the pledge of allegiance and, if desired, an invocation/moment of
silence. The mayor shall preserve strict order and decorum at all regular and
special meetings of the council. The mayor may move, second and debate from the
chair, subject only to those limitations of debate imposed on all members. The
mayor shall not be deprived of any of the rights and privileges of a council
member.
C.   The town clerk shall take the roll call. The town clerk shall announce
each agenda item, reading into the record the item as listed on the agenda,
sufficiently to advise the council and public as to what business is about to
be considered by the council. The town clerk shall also read motions into the
record as set forth in this section and perform other duties as set forth in
this section or as directed by the mayor.
D.   The mayor may appoint a sergeant-at-arms at the council meetings, who
shall carry out all orders and instructions given by the mayor for the purpose
of maintaining order and decorum at the council meeting. Upon instructions of
the mayor, it shall be the duty of the sergeant-at-arms to remove any person
who violates the order and decorum of the meeting, as set forth below.
Ordinance 99.32 inserted the words “if desired” before “an invocation/moment of
silence” in paragraph B
2-4-4 Procedures for meetings
The following procedures will generally apply to all regular town council
meetings. For special meetings, study sessions and other meetings, such as
joint meetings with other entities, retreats, subcommittee meetings, and task

pledge.

been explained to the mayor, town manager, or town clerk in advance shall
constitute an “excused absence”, and any absence which has not been explained
in advance shall be an “unexcused absence”. At the time of taking roll, the
mayor shall place into the record whether a council member’s absence is
“excused” or “unexcused”.
E.   Approval of agenda: the council shall vote to approve the agenda as
written, or shall modify the agenda by moving items or deleting items, and
shall approve the modified agenda. The council may, by majority vote, delete
agenda items or consider items out of sequence from the printed agenda, so long
as public notice is adhered to.
F.   Approval of minutes: the town clerk shall present minutes of previous
meetings to the council for approval. Council members who were not present at a
previous meeting may abstain from the vote approving those minutes, although
this is not required. The council may approve multiple minutes by one vote, and
if one or more council member expressed a desire to abstain from the vote on
one set of minutes, the motion may be to approve the minutes “except as noted
by council member(s) _______”. Minutes may be considered as part of the consent
agenda.
G.   Call to the public: persons wishing to address the council on any issue
within the jurisdiction of the council, except for items scheduled for a public
hearing at the same meeting, may do so during the call to the public. Each
speaker is limited to three minutes. The mayor or council may limit the total
time offered speakers. At the conclusion of call to the public, individual
members of the council may respond to criticism made by those who have
addressed the council, may ask staff to review the matter or may ask that the
matter be placed on a future agenda.
H.   Staff reports: a council member may ask a staff member about a particular
issue in his or her report, but discussion of any item mentioned in a staff
report may not be held unless that item is properly placed on the agenda.
I.   Order of business: the town clerk, if directed by the mayor, shall
announce each order of business, and the mayor shall then ask the council its
pleasure on the item. A motion need not be made in order for an item to be
discussed. Unless the council determines that no report is necessary, staff
shall have an opportunity to report on the issue and will respond to council
questions. The council may take action on any item listed on the agenda, and at
any time that agenda item is before the council a motion may be made as
provided in this chapter.
J.   Town manager’s and mayor’s reports: the town manager’s and the mayor’s
reports may be written or oral. Any council member may ask the town manager or
mayor about a particular item in his or her report, but discussion of any item
mentioned in the report may not be held unless that item is properly placed on
the agenda.
K.   Future agenda items: any council member may request that an item be placed
on a future agenda. If any other council member agrees, he or she will show his
or her support. Any item which is suggested and has support from at least two
other council members must be scheduled for the second regular town council
meeting following that meeting unless otherwise provided, and any suggested
item which does not receive support from at least two other council members may
be placed on a future agenda at the discretion of the mayor or the agenda
committee.

allowed to be considered in an executive session pursuant to A.R.S. § 38-

individuals who were present at a particular executive session or others

any issue may be limited by the mayor or council, but in no event will the
public testimony be limited to less than one hour.
G.   Council discussion: discussion by council members may be held at this
time, or reserved until the council has come out of public hearing.

statement to rebut the statements made by the public, to offer a compromise, or
to otherwise address the issue.
I.   Declaration of end of public hearing: Unless a majority of the council
members object, the mayor shall declare the termination of the public hearing.

2-4-7 Discussion and voting procedure
A.   A quorum must be present in order for the council to consider or act upon
any business. A quorum shall consist of a majority of the members of the
council, excluding vacancies. If a quorum is not present, the meeting shall be
called to order, and the only motion that can be made, considered and passed is
a motion for adjournment.
B.   Each council member has a responsibility for compliance with A.R.S. § 38-
501 et seq., concerning conflicts of interest. Any member of the council who
believes he or she has a conflict of interest, shall, immediately upon
determining that a conflict exists, declare the conflict of interest and
explain the basis for the conflict. That council member may then leave the room
and shall refrain from taking any part in the meeting, discussion,
consideration or determination of that issue. If that issue is not resolved at
that meeting, that council member shall not discuss the matter with any other
council member until the matter is finally resolved. The member who declared
the conflict may return to his or her seat when that agenda item is completed.
C.   Every council member desiring to speak shall address the mayor, and upon
recognition by the mayor, shall confine himself or herself to the question
under debate, avoiding all personalities and indecorous language.
D.   A council member, once recognized, shall not be interrupted when speaking
unless it is to call him or her to order. If a council member, while speaking,
is called to order, he or she shall cease speaking until the question of order
is determined, and, if in order, he or she shall be permitted to proceed.
E.   While the council is in session, the council members must preserve order
and decorum. A member shall not, by conversation or otherwise, delay or
interrupt the proceedings or the peace of the council or disturb any member
while speaking or refuse to obey the orders of the council or mayor, except as
otherwise provided in this title.
F.   If a person in the audience wishes to address the council on an issue on
the agenda which is not a public hearing, the mayor may permit the person to
speak or may present the request to the council. If a majority of the council
wishes to hear from the public on the issue, that person shall be permitted to
speak; however, any public address shall be limited to five minutes per person
and as otherwise restricted by the mayor or council. Written communications
delivered to the mayor before the agenda item was called will either be read
into the record or a copy delivered to each council member.
G.   Any person making personal, impertinent, or slanderous remarks, or who
becomes boisterous while addressing the council, or who interferes with the
order of business before the council, and who fails upon request of the mayor
to cease that activity, shall be barred from further audience before the
council for the remainder of that meeting unless permission to continue is
granted by a majority vote of the council.
H.   A motion shall be made by beginning the statement with words such as, “I
move that....” A motion must be stated clearly, and specifically state the
contents of the motion. There can be no discussion after a motion is made until
there is a second or the motion dies for lack of a second. If there is not a
second, the mayor shall announce that the motion failed for lack of a second,
and the discussion may continue, or the council may move on to the next agenda
item.
I.   After the motion is made and seconded, the town clerk should read back the
motion from the official record. The mayor may then call for discussion.
J.   At any time before the question is called on a pending motion, the council
member who made the motion may ask that his or her motion be amended. At the
time of the amendment, he or she shall clearly state the amendment, and the
amendment shall be read back by the town clerk. If the council member who
seconded the vote agrees, then the motion shall be considered amended
voluntarily.
K.   At any time before the question is called on a pending motion, a council
member may make a motion to amend the motion. At that time the discussion of
the underlying issue will stop. If there is no second to the motion to amend,
then discussion on the underlying issue will continue. If there is a second to
the motion to amend, then all discussion will be confined to the motion to
amend, and there shall be a vote on the motion to amend. If the motion to amend
is adopted by a majority of the council, discussion will continue on the motion
as amended. If the motion to amend fails, discussion will continue on the
original motion on the floor.
L.   At any time before the question is called on a pending motion, the council
member who made the motion may ask that his or her motion be withdrawn. The
motion will be withdrawn only if the council member who seconded the motion
agrees with withdrawal of the motion.
M.   Discussion shall end when the question is called or when the mayor
determines there is no further discussion desired by any council member. The
mayor shall direct the town clerk to read the motion, and the town clerk shall
read the motion as made or amended. The only persons who can object to the form
of the motion at this time are the council members who made and seconded the
motion. If there is a conflict as to whether the motion as read is the motion
as intended, the matter will revert to further discussion until the discrepancy
is corrected.
N.   The mayor shall ask council members to designate their individual votes by
announcing “aye” or “nay.” If, prior to the vote or after the vote, any council
member requests a roll call vote, the town clerk shall call roll, and each
council member shall state his or her vote aloud.
O.   After the vote, the town clerk shall announce whether the motion failed or
passed. If the vote was unanimous the town clerk shall so state, and if it was
not, the town clerk shall state the individual votes for the record, stating
the number of “aye” and “nay” votes. If any council member disagrees with the
vote as read back by the town clerk, he or she shall immediately request a
clarification or roll call vote. After the town clerk reads back the individual
votes, silence by any council member displays his or her agreement with the
vote as read.
P.   A motion passes if it receives more “aye” votes than the combined number
of “nay” votes plus the number of council members abstaining from voting on the
motion, except for abstentions based on conflict of interest. In the case of a
tie on any motion, the motion fails.

paragraph N
Ordinance 99.32 amended paragraph P by adding the first sentence, and deleted
former paragraph Q defining “Emergency.” Ordinance 2005.22 rewrote paragraph P.
2-4-8 Motions to reconsider
A.   Reconsideration of any action taken (or not taken) by the town council may
be requested only by a council member who was on the prevailing side of the
vote. Such a council member may request that the issue of reconsideration be
placed on the agenda for discussion and possible action, although this request
must be made prior to the start of the next regular town council meeting
following the meeting at which the action was taken. If such a request is made,
reconsideration will be placed on the agenda for the second regular town
council meeting following the meeting at which the original action was taken.
The agenda will list reconsideration of the vote as one item, and the re-vote
on the issue as a separate item.
B.   When that agenda item is called, the council may discuss the
reconsideration, but a motion to reconsider may only be made by a council
member who voted with the prevailing side of the vote. A motion to reconsider
may be seconded by any council member. The discussion and vote of the motion to
reconsider shall be as for any other business before the council.
C.   If the motion to reconsider fails, the council will skip the discussion
and vote of the original issue. If the motion to reconsider passes, the council
will discuss and vote on the original issue as for any other business before
the council, and any council member may make motions on the original issue.

cooperate fully with legal counsel appointed by the town to defend against any
threatened or pending litigation under the provisions of section 2-10-2 D.

deny the allegations of the complaint. Allegations not denied at the time of

civil sanction determined with the court’s due consideration of the explanation
submitted.
D.   If the person named in a civil code complaint denies the allegations of
the complaint, the court shall set the matter for hearing. All civil code
violation hearings are informal and without a jury, and the town is required to
prove the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. Technical rules of

that additional fines will be imposed for failure to abate a violation and that
the town may bring criminal charges for failure to obey the order to abate.
On March 31, 2010, the town attorney corrected, as a scrivener’s error under
the authority of section
1-4-5, the numbering of sections
5-7-7 through
5-7-11. They had been inadvertently and incorrectly renumbered to 5-7-8 through
5-7-12 by Ordinance 2010.02

this code, the land development code, a town ordinance or under state law,”
added paragraph G, and renumbered paragraph H.

superior court in the same manner as promulgated by the supreme court. The

All civil sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be paid within 30
days from entry of judgment, except that the court may extend the time for
payment or provide for installment payments if the court finds that payment
within 30 days will impose an undue economic burden on the defendant. A civil
sanction may be collected in the same manner as any other judgment in favor of
the town.
5-7-11 Failure to obey order to abate violation; penalty
Any person who fails to obey an order to abate a violation issued by a
magistrate, is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. A violation of this section is
punishable by up to a maximum six months in jail and by a maximum fine of
$2,500; and by probation up to three years.
Section 5-7-11 was revised by Ordinance 2007.32, which added “class 1” before
“misdemeanor,” and Ordinance 2010.02, which deleted “special magistrate, or
special limited magistrate” after “magistrate”

configuration of the premises, including a statement of total floor space
occupied by the business. The sketch or diagram need not be professionally
prepared but must be drawn to a designated scale or drawn with marked
dimensions of the interior of the premises to an accuracy of plus or minus six
inches. The license inspector may waive the foregoing diagram for renewal
applications if the applicant adopts a diagram that was previously submitted
and certifies that the configuration of the premises has not been altered since
it was prepared.

applicants for the license must have the premises inspected and approved by the
health department, fire department, building safety department, and zoning
department. Written certification of the inspections and approvals by each
inspecting agency must be submitted with each sexually oriented business
license application. A licensee who has not submitted the certifications within

the time of the previous license application must also have the respective
premises inspected and submit written certification of the inspections and
approvals by each inspecting agency with the licensee’s next application for
the renewal of a sexually oriented business license. Agencies responsible for
inspecting the premises of an existing or anticipated sexually oriented

applicant. In all cases, any person involved in the day-to-day operation of the

permit and failure to provide requested additional information regarding the

section
1-4-5
11-5-3 Noise standards in the resort and recreation zone
A.   Applicability; policy. The town has come to understand that certain
allowable activities within the resort and recreation zone may be disruptive to
the public health, safety and general welfare, the satisfaction, and the
feeling of well being to the surrounding residents. To control unnecessary,
excessive and annoying noise being generated from properties with the resort
and recreation (RR) zoning designation, it is the policy of the town to
maintain the standards identified in this section to protect the public health,
safety and general welfare of the surrounding residentially zoned properties.
All uses established or placed into operation after the effective date of this
section shall comply at all times hereafter with the following limitations or
performance standards.
B.   Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall be defined
as follows:
   1.   A weighted sound level. The sound pressure level in decibels as
measured on a sound level meter using the A weighted filter network. The A
weighted filter network is designed to simulate the response of the human ear.
The A weighted sound level is expressed by the symbol dBA.
   2.   Ambient noise. The composite of noise from all existing sources near
and far. The ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of
environmental noise at a given location, excluding any alleged offensive noise.
   3.   Decibel (dB). A unit for measuring the amplitude of a sound, equal to
20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound
measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals.
   4.   Impulsive noise. A noise of short duration, usually less than one
second, and of high intensity, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay.
   5.   Noise study. An acoustical analysis performed by a qualified noise
engineer which determines the potential noise impacts of a roadway, land use or
operation of equipment. The noise study will generate noise contours and
recommend mitigation for noise impacts which exceed the city’s noise standards.
   6.   Sound level meter. A sound level meter shall mean an instrument meeting
at a minimum the American National Standards Institute’s Types 1 or 2
Standards, or an instrument and the associated recording and analyzing
equipment which will provide equivalent data.
C.   Amplified noise standards. This section identifies stationary types of
noise sources. The type of noise standard contained in this section is for
amplified noise, which may be intrusive to a neighboring residential property.
The noise standards shown in table 1 are for regulating the impact of
stationary noise sources to a neighboring property.
D.   Exterior noise. It shall be unlawful for any person, entity or operation
at any location within the RR zone of the town to create any amplified noise,
or to allow the creation of any amplified noise on property owned, leased,
occupied or otherwise controlled by the person, which causes the noise level
when measured at the property line to exceed the noise standards found in table
1, and these amplified noise standards are hereby established and declared to
be reasonable and acceptable during the times stated in table 1.
 
TABLE 1
STATIONARY NOISE
SOURCE STANDARDS
Maximum noise levels measured at property line
7:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.—Not to exceed 55dBA
10:30 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.—Not to exceed 50dBA
 
E.   Exemptions. The following activities shall be exempt from these noise
standards:
   1.   Special events pursuant to an approved special event permit. Noise
impacts shall be evaluated and conditioned as part of the special event permit
process as set forth in
chapter 10-6.
   2.   Filming pursuant to a film permit. Noise impacts shall be evaluated and
conditioned as part of the film permit.
   3.   Activities conducted on public parks, public playgrounds and public or
private school grounds including school athletic and entertainment events that
are conducted under the sanction of the school or under a license or permit
duly issued pursuant to any provision of town code.
   4.   Noise sources associated with the maintenance of real property,
provided the activities take place between the hours of 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on any
day except Sunday or between the hours of 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday.
   5.   Any activity to the extent regulation of it has been preempted by state
or federal law.
F.   Noise level measurements. All noise shall be measured in accordance with
the following standards. Measurements shall be made with a Type 1 or Type 2
calibrated sound level meter utilizing the A weighting scale and the slow meter
response as specified by the American National Standards Institute (A.N.S.I.).
Noise levels shall be measured in decibels and A weighted. Meters shall be
maintained in calibration and in good working order. The measurement location
is at the property line between the RR Zone and the residentially zoned
property.
G.   Measurement procedure. The sound level meter shall be operated in
accordance with the instrument manufacturer’s instructions and as follows:
   1.   Microphone orientation. The microphone shall be pointed towards the
allegedly offensive noise source, unless the manufacturer’s instructions
specifically indicate otherwise.
   2.   Meter setting. The meter shall be set for the A weighted network and
“slow” response mode.
   3.   Calibration. An internal or external calibration check shall be made
before and after each use.
   4.   Sound levels shall be measured at the approximate location of the
property line, at a height of at least three feet above the immediate
surrounding surface.
   5.   Windscreens shall be used whenever appropriate.
H.   To implement and enforce this section effectively, the chief of police
shall, within a reasonable time after the effective date of this section,
develop and promulgate standards and procedures for testing and validating
sound level meters used in enforcement of this section.
I.   A law enforcement agent shall command any person violating this section to
abate his or her violation. It is unlawful for any person to fail to comply
with an order of a law enforcement agent regarding a noise violation. Each
violation of the order of a law enforcement agent under this subsection shall
constitute a separate offense of this section.
J.   Noise studies required.
   1.   Pre-development noise studies. A pre development noise study is
performed prior to development and is designed to project future noise levels
and recommend mitigation measures to be implemented in project development. A
registered noise engineer as approved by the town shall prepare all noise
studies. Noise studies may be required when a noise generating use, such as an
amphitheater, arena, etc., is proposed in the RR zoning district. The need for
a noise study will be determined at the time of development review. Pre-
development noise studies shall project future noise levels based on proposed
uses, traffic volumes and other relevant future conditions. Existing and
projected noise shall be evaluated pursuant to the noise standards within this
section. Mitigation measures shall be proposed to bring noise levels into
compliance with these standards. Mitigation measures may consist of walls,
berms, setbacks, landscaping, building materials, construction methods and any
other means whereby noise can be reduced to the levels within this section.
K.   Enforcement.
   1.   It shall be unlawful for any person in the RR zoning district, within
the town, to create any exterior noise, or to allow the creation of any noise
on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by the person,
which causes the noise level when measured according to this section, to exceed
the maximum allowable noise levels in Table 1 of this section.
   2.   No person shall interfere with, oppose or resist any authorized person
charged with the enforcement of this section while the authorized person is
engaged in the performance of his or her duty.
   3.   Any person violating any provision of this section shall be deemed
responsible of a civil infraction. A law enforcement agent shall command any
person violating this section to abate his or her violation. It is unlawful for
any person to fail to comply with an order of a law enforcement agent regarding
a noise violation. Each violation of the order of a law enforcement agent under
this subsection shall constitute a separate offense of this section.
   4.   The operation or maintenance of any device, instrument, or machinery in
violation of any noise standard identified in this section is hereby declared
to be a public nuisance and may be abated pursuant to the nuisance abatement
procedure in the town code.
   5.   Pursuant to this section, each person shall be deemed responsible of a
separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any
violation of any provision of this section is committed, continued, or
permitted by the person and shall be punished accordingly.
   6.   Even though compliance with performance standards or procedures in
obtaining any permit is not required for a particular use, initial and
continued compliance with performance standards is required of every use and
the provisions for enforcement of continued compliance with performance
standards shall be invoked by the police and planning departments against any
use if there are reasonable grounds to believe that performance standards are
being violated by that use.
   7.   The designee of the police and planning departments shall investigate
any purported violation of noise standards and, if there is reasonable ground
for same, shall commence proceedings to abate the violation. The town, to
assist in the abatement proceedings, may employ qualified expert consultants.

perform road work or grading, outside these hours, the contractor shall make an
application to the town’s development engineering division or capital
improvement projects division, as applicable, for an extended work permit. Town
staff shall consider whether construction noise in the vicinity of the proposed
work site is less objectionable at night than during the day due to population
levels or activities or interference with traffic, and whether the noise will
cause significant disturbance in residential areas. Emergency work or repairs
may be authorized by the appropriate division manager regardless of the time of
day. The town may use any factor or reasoning to allow work during extended
hours if there exists a community benefit.
F.   The holder of an extended work permit for site construction or grading and

posting. Once premises are initially posted as a result of an unruly
residential activity and the unruly activity has ceased, a resumption of unruly
activity on the premises resulting in another police response shall constitute
a new and separate unruly residential activity for purposes of this chapter.
C.   The owner, occupant, or tenant of the posted premises shall be responsible
for ensuring that the notice is not removed, defaced, or concealed. The
removal, defacement, or concealment of a posted notice shall be a civil
infraction carrying a penalty of a minimum, mandatory $100 fine, in addition to
any other penalties which may be imposed under this chapter. The owner,
occupant or tenant of the premises or sponsor of the unruly residential
activity, if present, shall be consulted about the location where the notice is
posted to achieve both the security of the notice and its prominent display.
D.   An owner, occupant, or tenant of the posted premises may contest the
posting of the notice by filing a written application for a hearing with the
Marana municipal court requesting that the court determine whether
justification existed for posting of the notice under the provisions of this
chapter. The application shall be filed within ten days after the posting of
the notice or, if the notice is given by mail, within ten days after mailing of
the notice, and not thereafter. The court shall set a time and date for a
hearing to be held no later than 15 days after receipt of the written
application for a hearing and shall notify both the applicant and the town’s
prosecutor of the hearing date. At the hearing, the town shall prove by a
preponderance of evidence that the posting of the notice was justified pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter.
E.   The term “owner” as used throughout this chapter includes any agent of
owner acting on behalf of the owner to control or otherwise regulate the
occupancy or use of the property.

be mailed to any property owner at the address shown on the Pima County
property tax assessment records. The notification shall advise the property
owner that any subsequent unruly activity within 120 days on the same premises
shall result in liability of the property owner for all applicable penalties as
provided in this chapter. Notification shall be made by certified mail. The
return receipt shall be prima facia evidence of service.
11-11-4 Subsequent unruly residential activity a civil infraction; parties
liable
A.   The occurrence of an unruly residential activity on the same premises more

   1.   The owner of the property where the unruly residential activity
occurred, provided that notification of posting was mailed to the owner of the
property as provided in section
11-11-3 and that the unruly residential activity occurred not less than two
weeks after the mailing of the notification.
   2.   The owner, occupant, or tenant of the property where the unruly
residential activity occurred.
   3.   The person or persons who organized or sponsored the event constituting
the unruly residential activity.
   4.   Any person in attendance at the unruly residential activity who engaged
in any conduct causing the activity to be unruly.
B.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the
owner, occupant, or tenant of the premises or sponsor of the event constituting
the unruly residential activity, for the conduct of persons who are in
attendance without the express or implied consent of the owner, occupant,
tenant, or sponsor, as long as the owner, occupant, tenant or sponsor has taken
all steps reasonably necessary to exclude the uninvited persons from the
premises, including owners who are actively attempting to evict a tenant from
the premises. Where an invited person engages in unlawful conduct which the
owner, occupant, tenant or sponsor could not reasonably foresee and could not
reasonably control without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct
of the person shall not be attributable to the owner, occupant, tenant or
sponsor for the purposes of determining liability under this section.

CHAPTER 12-8.   WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY
Chapter 12-8 was adopted by Ordinance 2018.002. For prior history, see
Ordinances 2008.11 and 2016.005
12-8-1 Purpose and background
A.   The purpose of this chapter is to:
   1.   Implement Arizona laws 2017, chapter 124 (A.R.S. § 9-591 et seq.);
   2.   Incorporate standard terms by reference in each individual telecom
license agreement and right-of-way permit;
   3.   Promote uniformity in the telecom license agreements; and
   4.   Streamline the preparation and administration of telecom license
agreements.
B.   Various laws (the “telecommunications laws”) authorize the town to
regulate its streets, alleys and public utility easements, and to grant, renew,
deny, amend and terminate licenses for and otherwise regulate the installation,
operation and maintenance of telecommunications systems. The telecommunications
laws include, without limitation, the following:
   1.   Chapter 12-7 of the town code (construction in town rights-of-way) (the
“street code”). Town code section
12-7-3 (permit required; exception) applies to a wireless provider, as defined
in A.R.S. § 9-591(26).
   2.   A.R.S. §§ 9-581 through 9-583, §§ 9-591 through 9-599, and other state
and federal statutes.
   3.   The constitution of the state of Arizona.
   4.   Other applicable federal, state and local laws, codes, rules and
regulations.
   5.   The town’s police powers, its authority over public right-of-way, and
its other governmental powers and authority.
C.   The town owns public street and alley rights-of-way and public utility
easements within the boundaries of the town that are designated for use by
utility companies for installation, operation and repair of water, electrical
and other utilities pursuant to franchises, licenses or other agreements
between utility companies and the town (collectively the “right-of-way”).
D.   The town anticipates that one or more wireless providers may desire to
locate antennas and immediately related equipment at various locations (“the
sites”) within the right-of-way.
E.   The standard terms become effective as to each site as they are
incorporated in the telecom license agreement by reference. Except as otherwise
stated, each telecom license agreement stands on its own.
F.   Because the town’s existing streetlight poles and traffic signed poles are
not designed to safely support the additional weight and stress of wireless
facilities, wireless providers shall be required to provide poles designed to
support these facilities to replace existing poles prior to attaching wireless
facilities.

12-8-3 Wireless communication facilities use area
Authority to use right-of-way. The town grants to wireless provider the right
to install wireless facilities in the town’s right-of-way upon approval of a
telecom license agreement and issuance of a right-of-way permit for each use
area, as set forth below:
A.   Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this
chapter 12-8 or in the telecom license agreement to the contrary, the use area
includes and is limited to only certain areas that wireless provider is
permitted to exclusively use and occupy (the “exclusive areas”) and certain
areas that wireless provider is permitted to use on a shared basis (the “shared
areas”). Each use area is defined by the boundary plan.
B.   Use area boundary. The use area is the smallest geometric shape that
includes the exclusive areas and the shared areas. The use area excludes other
parts of the right-of-way and all other land. Wireless provider shall not
occupy or use any other portion of the right-of-way or adjoining lands. The
telecom license agreement does not allow any use of land outside the right-of-
way. If any portion of wireless provider’s work, improvement or equipment is to
be located on other land, then such work, improvements and equipment are
prohibited unless wireless provider first obtains from the owner of said land
(including the town, if applicable) an agreement allowing such work,
improvements and equipment (a “supplemental parcel agreement”).
C.   Exclusive areas. The exclusive areas are limited to the following, if and
as defined by the boundary plan:
   1.   The land area defined as “enclosure” on the boundary plan to be used by
wireless provider solely for the enclosure housing the electronic ground
equipment shown on the site plan (the “enclosure”). The area of the enclosure
is confined to the actual area occupied by the exterior structure and the
interior of the enclosure. If the boundary plan does not show a clearly defined
and correctly labeled “enclosure” area, then no enclosure area is available for
wireless provider’s use under an issued right-of-way permit and any enclosure
for wireless provider’s use must be located outside the right-of-way and
authorized by a supplemental parcel agreement.
   2.   The area on the pole defined as “antennas” on the boundary plan to be
used by wireless provider solely for mounting the antennas. Such area is
confined to the town approved elevations and locations actually occupied by the
antennas and their supporting brackets. If the boundary plan does not show a
clearly defined and correctly labeled “antennas” area, then no main antennas
area is available for wireless provider’s use under an issued right-of-way
permit and any main antennas for wireless provider’s use must be located
outside the right-of-way and authorized by a supplemental parcel agreement.
D.   Shared areas. Shared areas are limited to the following areas, if and as
defined by the boundary plan:
   1.   A motor vehicle parking space (the “parking space”) at the “parking
space” location described on the boundary plan to be used by wireless provider
solely for parking a service vehicle to service the communications equipment
and for ingress and egress to that parking space.
   2.   No temporary construction area is provided by these standard terms or
an issued right-of-way permit. Wireless provider must obtain from the town a
separate written document giving wireless provider permission to work in the
right-of-way.
   3.   An underground cable route (the “signal route”) labeled as the “signal
route” described on the boundary plan from the enclosure to the antenna to be
used by wireless provider solely for underground radio frequency lines between
the enclosure and the antenna. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
portion of the signal route upon the pole shall not be underground but shall be
within the pole. If the boundary plan does not show a clearly defined and
correctly labeled “signal route” area, then no signal route area is available
for wireless provider’s use under these standard terms or an issued right-of-
way permit and any signal route for wireless provider’s use must be located
outside the right-of-way and authorized by a supplemental parcel agreement.
E.   Power and telephone service. Nothing in this
chapter 12-8 grants permission for any use of any portion of the right-of-way
for power, telephone or other service routes, if any. Use of the public street
right-of-way or public utility easements for these purposes, if any, is
governed by normal town right-of-way rules and policies and by the franchise
between the town and the electrical and telephone service providers.
F.   Rights in adjacent land. Wireless provider’s rights are expressly limited
to the real property defined as the “use area” in the issued right-of-way
permit. Without limitation, in the event any public right-of-way or other
public or private property at or adjacent to the use area is owned, dedicated,
abandoned or otherwise acquired, used, improved or disposed of by the town,
such property shall not accrue to wireless provider but shall be the town’s
only.
G.   Variation in area. In the event the use area consists of more or less than
any stated area, wireless provider’s obligations under the telecom license
agreement shall not be increased or diminished.
H.   Condition of title. Wireless provider shall not have power to amend,
modify, terminate or otherwise change the site documents or create new site
documents.
   1.   The town does not warrant its own or any other person’s title to or
rights to use the use area or any other property.
   2.   Wireless provider shall pay, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
town and its agents and representatives of, from and against any and all
claims, demands, damages, expenses, interest or penalties of any kind or nature
whatsoever, including attorneys’, arbitrators’ and experts’ fees and court
costs that arise from or relate to wireless provider’s non-compliance with the
site documents.
I.   Condition of use area. Each use area is being made available in an “as is”
condition without any express or implied warranties of any kind, including
without limitation any warranties or representations as to its condition or
fitness for any use.
J.   No real property interest. Notwithstanding any provision of this
chapter 12-8 to the contrary, and notwithstanding any negotiation,
correspondence, course of performance or dealing, or other statements or acts
by or between the parties, wireless provider’s rights under the telecom license
agreement and any right-of-way permit are limited to use and occupation of the
use area for the permitted uses. Wireless provider’s rights in the use area are
limited to the specific rights created in the approved telecom license
agreement and right-of-way permit.
K.   Reserved right and competing users and activities. Notwithstanding
anything in this
chapter 12-8 or in the approved telecom license agreement to the contrary, the
town specifically reserves to itself and excludes from an issued right-of-way
permit a non-exclusive delegable right (the “reserved right”) over the entire
use area for all manner of real and personal improvements and for streets,
sidewalks, trails, landscaping, utilities and every other land use of every
description. Without limitation:
   1.   Competing users. Wireless provider accepts the risk that the town and
others (the “competing users”) may now or in the future install their
facilities in the use area in locations that make parts of the right-of-way
unavailable for wireless provider’s use.
   2.   Competing activities. Wireless provider accepts the risk that there may
now or in the future exist all manner of work and improvements upon the use
area (the “competing activities”). The competing activities include without
limitation any and all laying construction, erection, installation, use,
operation, repair, replacement, removal, relocation, raising, lowering,
widening, realigning or other dealing with any or all of the following, whether
above, upon or below the surface of the use area and whether occasioned by
existing or proposed uses of the right-of-way or existing or proposed uses of
adjoining or nearby land:
      a.   All manner of streets, alleys, sidewalks, trails, ways, traffic
control devices, subways, tunnels, trains and gates of every description, and
all manner of other transportation facilities and their appurtenances.
      b.   All manner of pipes, wires, cables, conduits, sewers, pumps, valves,
switches, conductors, connectors, poles, supports, access points and guy wires
of every description, and all manner of other utility facilities and their
appurtenances.
      c.   All manner of canals, drains, bridges, viaducts, overpasses,
underpasses, culverts, markings, balconies, porches, overhangs and other
encroachments of every description and all manner of other facilities and their
appurtenances.
      d.   All other uses of the right-of-way that the town may permit from
time to time.
   3.   The town’s rights cumulative. All of the town’s reserved rights under
various provisions of the town code or an approved telecom license agreement
shall be cumulative to each other.
   4.   Use priorities. This
chapter 12-8 and the approved telecom license agreement and right-of-way permit
do not grant to wireless provider or establish for wireless provider any
exclusive rights or priority in favor of wireless provider to use the use area.
Wireless provider shall not obstruct or interfere with or prevent any competing
user from using the use area.
   5.   Regulation. The town shall have full authority to regulate use of the
use area and to resolve competing demands and preferences regarding use of the
use area and to require wireless provider to cooperate and participate in
implementing such resolutions. Without limitation, the town may take any or all
of the following into account in regulating use of the use area:
      a.   All timing, public, operational, financial and other factors
affecting existing and future proposals, needs and plans for competing
activities.
      b.   All other factors the town may consider relevant, whether or not
mentioned in this
chapter 12-8, the telecom license agreement, or issued right-of-way permits.
      c.   Differing regulatory regimes or laws applicable to claimed rights,
public benefits, community needs and all other factors relating to competing
users and competing activities.
   6.   Communications equipment relocation. Upon 180 days’ notice from the
town, wireless provider shall temporarily or permanently relocate or otherwise
modify the communications equipment relocation (the “relocation work”) as
follows:
      a.   Wireless provider shall perform the relocation work at its own
expense when required by the town engineer or designee.
      b.   The relocation work includes all work determined by the town to be
necessary to accommodate competing activities, including without limitation
temporarily or permanently removing, protecting, supporting, disconnecting or
relocating any portion of the communications equipment.
      c.   The town may perform any part of the relocation work that has not
been performed within the allotted time. Wireless provider shall reimburse the

obligation to move wireless provider’s, the town’s or others’ facilities, but
will in good faith assist wireless provider to find a new location and to
expedite the approval process.
      d.   The town and not wireless provider shall be entitled to use any of
wireless provider’s facilities that are abandoned in place or that are not
relocated on the town’s request.
      e.   All relocation work shall be subject to and comply with all other
provisions of the telecom license agreement.
   7.   Disruption by competing users. Neither the town nor any agent,
contractor or employee of the town shall be liable to wireless provider, its
customers or third parties for any service disruption or for any other harm
caused them or the communications equipment due to competing users or competing
activities.
   8.   Emergency disruption by the town. The town may remove, alter, tear out,
relocate or damage portions of the communications equipment in the case of
fire, disaster, or other emergencies if the town engineer deems such action to
be reasonably necessary under the circumstances. The town will make reasonable
efforts to contact the wireless provider’s network operations center. In that
event, neither the town nor any agent, contractor or employee of the town shall
be liable to wireless provider or its customers or third parties for any harm
so caused to them or the communications equipment. When practical, the town
shall consult with wireless provider in advance to assess the necessity of such
actions and to minimize to the extent practical under the circumstances damage
to and disruption of operation of the communications equipment. In any event,
the town shall inform wireless provider after such actions. Wireless provider’s
work to repair or restore the communications equipment shall be relocation
work.
   9.   Public safety. If the communications equipment or any other wireless
provider equipment, improvements or activities present any immediate hazard or
impediment to the public, to the town, to the town’s equipment or facilities,
to other improvements or activities within or without the use area, or to the
town’s ability to safely and conveniently operate the right-of-way or perform
the town’s utility, public safety or other public health, safety and welfare
functions, then wireless provider shall immediately remedy the hazard, comply
with the town’s requests to secure the right-of-way, and otherwise cooperate
with the town at no expense to the town to remove any such hazard or
impediment. Wireless provider’s work crews shall report to the use area within
four hours of any request by the town under this paragraph (the “safety
paragraph”).
L.   Third party permission. There may be portions of the right-of-way, such as
canal crossings or other areas that for any reason have limited right-of-way
dedications or that have regulatory use restrictions imposed by a third party
(“third party”). Areas subject to such restrictions or regulations by third
parties are referred to as “third party areas” and communications equipment may
not be built without permission from the third party or third parties that have
property rights or regulatory authority over a specific third party area.
Wireless provider’s right to use any use area shall be suspended, but not its
obligations with respect thereto, during any period that a third party
permission is not in effect.

additional ten-year period subject to consent by the town and wireless
provider, which either may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.
      b.   Both the town and wireless provider shall be deemed to have elected
to extend unless the town or wireless provider, respectively, gives notice to
the contrary to the other at least 90 days prior to the end of the original
term or the current extension.
      c.   The second term shall begin ten years plus one day after the initial
effective date.
B.   Holding over. In any circumstance whereby wireless provider would remain
in possession or occupancy of the use area after the expiration of the
applicable telecom license agreement and issued right-of-way permits (as
extended, if applicable), such holding over shall not be deemed to operate as a
renewal or extension of the telecom license agreement and issued right-of-way
permits, but shall only create a use right from month to month that may be
terminated at any time by the town upon 30 days’ notice to wireless provider,
or by wireless provider upon 60 days’ notice to the town.
C.   The town’s right to cancel. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
chapter 12-8 or in the approved telecom license agreement to the contrary, the
town shall have the unconditional right, with or without cause, to terminate
any right-of-way permit for reasons including but not limited to street
widening, right-of-way abandonment, or development that may impact the location
of the site, upon 180 days’ notice given at any time after the first 180 days.
The town shall assist wireless provider in locating a new site for the facility
and expedite the process.
D.   Wireless provider’s right to cancel. Wireless provider shall have the
unilateral right to terminate any right-of-way permit without cause upon 30
days’ written notice. Wireless provider has no right to terminate any time
after an event of default by wireless provider has occurred (or an event has
occurred that would become a default after passage of time or giving of
notice).

of credit as may be provided elsewhere in the telecom license agreement.
   7.   Late fees. Use fee is deemed paid only when the town actually receives
good cash payment. Should any use fee not be paid on or before the date due, a
late fee shall be added to the amount due in an amount established by a fee
schedule adopted by the council and amended from time to time. Any use fee that
is not timely paid shall accrue simple interest at the rate of 1½% per month
from the date the amount first came due until paid. Wireless provider expressly
agrees that the foregoing represent fair and reasonable estimates by the town
and wireless provider of the town’s costs (such as accounting, administrative,
legal, and processing costs) in the event of a delay in payment of use fee. The
town shall have the right to allocate payments received from wireless provider
among wireless provider’s obligations.
   8.   Use fee amounts cumulative. All amounts payable by wireless provider
under this
chapter 12-8 or an approved telecom license agreement or under any tax,

U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq., or any other federal, state, county, or local law
pertaining to hazardous substances, waste or toxic substances and their
reporting requirements (collectively “toxic substances”):
      a.   Wireless provider understands the hazards presented to persons,
property and the environment by dealing with toxic substances. Notwithstanding
anything in this
chapter 12-8 or in the approved telecom license agreement to the contrary, the
town makes and has made no warranties as to whether the use area contains
actual or presumed asbestos or other toxic substances.
      b.   Within 24 hours after discovery by wireless provider of any toxic

agreement terminates or expires for any reason. In the event of relocation of
the communications equipment or damage to the use area severe enough that the
communications equipment cannot reasonably be operated during repairs, the
operation requirements of this paragraph shall be suspended during the time
specified by these standard terms for accomplishing repair of such damage to
relocation of the communications equipment. Wireless provider may temporarily
cease operating the communications equipment for short periods necessary to
test, repair, service or upgrade the communications equipment.

12-8-7 Wireless provider’s improvements generally
All of wireless provider’s improvements and other construction work, whether or
not specifically described in this
chapter 12-8 or in the approved telecom license agreement, upon or related to
the use area (collectively “wireless provider’s improvements”) shall comply
with the following:
A.   Wireless provider’s improvements. Wireless provider’s improvements include
without limitation, all modification, replacement, repairs, installation,
construction, grading, structural, utility, lighting, plumbing, sewer or other
alterations, parking or traffic alterations, removal, demolition or other
cumulatively significant construction or similar work of any description and
all installation or alteration of the communications equipment.
B.   Zoning and similar approval process. The zoning processes, building permit
processes, right-of-way management policies and similar regulatory requirements
that apply to wireless provider’s improvements are completely separate from the
plans approval processes set forth in these standard terms. Wireless provider’s
satisfaction of any requirement set forth in these standard terms does not
substitute for compliance with any regulatory requirement. Wireless provider’s
satisfaction of any regulatory requirement does not substitute for compliance
with any requirement of these standard terms. Wireless provider must make all
submittals and communications regarding the requirements of these standard
terms through the town engineer and not through planning, zoning, building
safety or other staff. Wireless provider shall be responsible to directly
obtain all necessary permits and approvals from any and all governmental or
other entities having standing or jurisdiction over the use area. Wireless
provider bears sole responsibility to comply with all stipulations and
conditions that are required in order to secure such rezoning and other
approvals. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph, to the extent regulatory
requirements and requirements of these standard terms are identical, compliance
with regulatory requirements shall constitute compliance with these standard
terms and vice versa.
C.   Batching sites for approval. Only sites that do not have a new or a
replacement pole required for the antennas, and do not have any underground
cables, conduit, and foundations, are eligible for batch processing of the
applications.
D.   Relationship of plans approval to regulatory processes. Wireless
provider’s submission of plans under these standard terms, the town’s approval
of plans for purposes of these standard terms, and the plans approval process
herein shall be separate and independent of all development, zoning, design
review and other regulatory or similar plans submittal and approval processes,
all of which shall continue to apply as provided under state law, in addition
to the requirements of these standard terms and its approvals. Building
permits, zoning clearances, or any other governmental reviews or actions do not
constitute approval of any plans for purposes of the telecom license agreement.
E.   The town’s fixtures and personalty. Wireless provider shall not remove,
alter or damage in any way any improvements or any personal property of the
town upon the use area without the town’s prior written approval. In all cases,
wireless provider will repair any damage or other alteration to the town’s
property caused by wireless provider or its contractors, employees or agents to
as good or better condition than existed before the damage or alteration.
F.   Design requirements. All wireless provider’s improvements shall comply
with the following design requirements:
   1.   All wireless provider’s improvements shall be contained entirely within
the use area and without any encroachment or dependence upon any other
property, except for permitted utility service.
   2.   Any changes to utility facilities shall be strictly limited to the use
area, shall not affect utilities used by the town, and shall be undertaken by
wireless provider at its sole cost and expense.
   3.   The antennas and other communications equipment shall be properly
designed, installed and maintained so as not to create a risk of damage to the
pole, to persons or property upon or using the right-of-way or the town’s other
property.
   4.   To the extent requested by the town, wireless provider’s plans shall
include a description of construction methods employed to address environmental
issues affecting or affected by the use area and protect other facilities at
the right-of-way and surrounding properties.
   5.   All specifications set forth in sections
12-8-8 through
12-8-12 below.
G.   Approval required. Wireless provider shall not construct any of wireless
provider’s improvements (including work on adjacent public lands, if
applicable) without having first received written plans approval from the town.
Such consent requirement shall apply to all improvements, furnishings,
equipment, fixtures, paint, wall treatments, utilities of every description,
communications cabling and other construction work of any description as
described in all plans heretofore or hereafter delivered by wireless provider
to the town. Such consent requirement does not apply to work on the
communications equipment that is confined to the area inside the enclosure and
not visible, audible, or otherwise discernible outside the enclosure.
H.   Effect of plans approval. Wireless provider shall submit engineering and
construction plans to the town for review and approval. The town’s approval of
plans submitted shall be for purposes of these standard terms only and shall
constitute irrevocable approval (but only at the level of detail of the
applicable stage of the review process) of the matters plainly shown on the
plans approved. The town shall not reject subsequent plans to the extent the
matter to which the town objects was plainly shown on plans previously approved
by the town. However, the town is not precluded from objecting to matters not
previously approved, changes to plans, matters not previously clearly disclosed
on approved plans, or refinements or implementation of matters previously
approved.
I.   Plans required. Wireless provider’s design of all wireless provider’s
improvements shall occur in three stages culminating in final working
construction documents for the wireless provider’s improvements (the “final
plans”). The three stages are, in order of submission and in increasing order
of detail, as follows:
      a.   Conceptual plans showing the general layout, locations, elevations,
configuration, and capacities of all significant improvements, topographical
features, pedestrian and vehicular ways, buildings, utilities, and other
features significantly affecting the appearance, design, function or operation
of each element of wireless provider’s improvements.
      b.   Preliminary plans showing all surface finishes and treatments,
finished elevations, general internal and external design (including without
limitation colors, textures and materials), mechanical, communications,
electrical, plumbing and other utility systems, building materials, landscaping
and all other elements necessary prior to preparation of final working
construction documents and showing compliance with all requirements of these
standard terms. The preliminary plans shall show all detail necessary prior to
preparation of final plans.
      c.   Final plans. In addition to the information that the town required
for preliminary plans, the final plans shall include engineering design
documents for the pole foundation, pole structural design, and other generally
required engineering specifications for construction drawings for permits.
J.   Approval process. The following procedure shall govern wireless provider’s
submission to the town of all plans for wireless provider’s improvements,
including any proposed changes by wireless provider to previously approved
plans:
      a.   All plans wireless provider submits under these standard terms shall
show design, appearance, capacity, views, and other information reasonably
deemed necessary by the town for a complete understanding of the work proposed,
all in detail reasonably deemed appropriate by the town for the level of plans
required herein.
      b.   Wireless provider shall deliver all plans submissions for non-
regulatory approvals required in this
chapter 12-8 or in the approved telecom license agreement directly to the town
engineer and shall clearly label the submissions to indicate that they are
submitted pursuant to this
chapter 12-8 and the approved telecom license agreement and not for building
permits, zoning or other approvals. Each submittal of plans by wireless
provider for the town’s review shall include the number and format of plans
conforming to then-current town administrative procedures.
      c.   All construction plans shall be prepared by qualified registered
professional engineers.
      d.   The town and wireless provider shall endeavor to resolve design and
construction issues to their mutual satisfaction but, in the event of an
impasse for any reason or however arising, in light of the town’s ownership and
other uses of the use area, and as a condition of the town’s issuance of a
right-of-way permit, final decision authority regarding all design and
construction issues shall rest with the town engineer.
      e.   All of wireless provider’s improvements shall comply with all
requirements of law, any applicable insurance contracts and these standard
terms.
K.   Cost of wireless provider improvements. All wireless provider’s
improvements shall be designed and constructed by wireless provider at wireless
provider’s sole cost and expense, including without limitation any alteration
or other change to the town’s equipment or other improvements or personalty
that may occur. In no event shall the town be obligated to compensate wireless
provider in any manner for any of wireless provider’s improvements or other
work provided by wireless provider during or related to the term of the telecom
license agreement or any right-of-way permit. Wireless provider shall timely
pay for all labor, materials, work, and all professional and other services
related thereto and shall pay, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
town and the town’s employees, officers, contractors and agents against all
claims related to such items. Wireless provider shall bear the cost of all work
required from time to time to cause the use area and the town’s adjoining
property (if directly affected by wireless provider’s work) to comply with
local zoning rules, the Americans with disabilities act, building codes and all
similar rules, regulations and other laws if such work is required because of
work performed by wireless provider, by wireless provider’s use of the use
area, or by any exercise of the rights granted to wireless provider under this
chapter 12-8 or a telecom license agreement.
L.   Improvement quality. Any and all work performed on the use area by
wireless provider shall be performed in a workman-like manner meeting or
exceeding the best practices of similar facilities in Pima County, Arizona, and
shall be diligently pursued to completion and in conformance with all building
codes and similar rules. All of wireless provider’s improvements shall be high
quality, safe, fire resistant, modern in design, and attractive in appearance,
all as approved by the town through the plans approval processes described in
these standard terms in addition to any zoning, building code or other
regulatory processes that may apply.
M.   Ownership of wireless provider’s improvements. All wireless provider’s
improvements (including without limitation poles and lights) except the
communications equipment shall be and become part of the real property of the
town “brick by brick” as constructed or installed.
N.   Damage during work. Upon performing any work upon the right-of-way,
wireless provider shall simultaneously restore the right-of-way to its prior
condition, as directed by the town and repair any holes, mounting surfaces or

12-8-15 Breach by wireless provider
Wireless provider shall comply with, perform and do each obligation required of
wireless provider in this
chapter 12-8 and in the approved telecom license agreement, and shall cause all
persons using the use area on behalf of wireless provider to do the same.
Wireless provider’s failure to do    so shall be a material breach by wireless
provider of these standard terms.
A.   Events of default. Each telecom license agreement and right-of-way permit
is approved upon the condition that each and every one of the following events
shall be deemed an “event of default” by wireless provider of wireless

shall not cure such arrearage within 15 days after the town has notified
wireless provider of such arrearage.
   2.   If wireless provider shall fail to operate the communications equipment
(except during specific periods expressly excused herein) for a period of 30
consecutive days or a total of 60 days within any 12-month period.
   3.   If wireless provider shall fail to maintain any insurance required
under these standard terms. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such
failure shall not be a default if within five business days after notice from
the town, wireless provider provides to the town the required insurance and the
required evidence thereof. Such insurance must cover the past for a period
adequate that there is no gap in the insurance coverage required by these
standard terms.
   4.   If the wireless provider’s right to use a pole expires or is terminated
for any reason.
   5.   If wireless provider does not commence and diligently pursue to
completion each required stage of construction of the site within the times
required herein. The times specified for concluding each stage of required
construction have been established far enough in advance, and have taken into
account the likelihood of construction delays, so that no cure period is
provided.
   6.   If wireless provider is the subject of a voluntary or involuntary
bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar proceeding or if any assignment
of any of wireless provider’s or such other person’s property is made for the
benefit of creditors or if wireless provider or such other person dies or is
not regularly paying its debts as they come due (collectively a “wireless
provider insolvency”).
   7.   If the issuer of any letter of credit fails for any reason to timely
and fully honor any request by the town for funds or other performance under
the instrument and wireless provider fails to cause the issuer to or some other
person to honor the request within ten days after the town notifies wireless
provider that a town request for funds has not been honored.
   8.   If wireless provider fails to obtain or maintain any licenses, permits,
or other governmental approvals pertaining to the right-of-way or timely pay
any taxes pertaining to the right-of-way and does not cure the failure within
30 days which shall be extended to 90 days if wireless provider begins to cure
in good faith within 30 days.
   9.   If the town is exposed to any liability, obligation, damage, cost,
expense, or other claim of any description, whether or not asserted; except
that this is not an event of default if wireless provider does all of the
following:
      a.   Gives immediate notice to the town of wireless provider’s commitment
to indemnify, defend and hold the town harmless against the claim.
      b.   Promptly commences and continues to indemnify, defend and hold the
town harmless against the claim.
   10.   If wireless provider fails to meet its obligations under section
12-8-13 (RF safety for town employees).
   11.   If wireless provider engages in a pattern of repeated failure (or
neglect) to timely do or perform or observe any provision contained in this
chapter 12-8 or in the approved telecom license agreement. After the town has
once given notice of any failure by wireless provider to comply with its
obligations set forth in these standard terms, the following shall constitute a
repeated failure by wireless provider to comply with such provision:
      a.   Another failure to comply with any provision of these standard terms
during the following 30-day period.
      b.   Three or more failures to comply with any provision of these
standard terms during any 90-day period.
      c.   Six or more failures to comply with any provision of these standard
terms during any 12-month period.
   12.   If wireless provider fails or neglects to timely and completely do or
perform or observe any other provisions of this
chapter 12-8 or the approved telecom license agreement and the failure or
neglect continues for a period of 30 days after the town has notified wireless
provider in writing of the failure or neglect.
B.   The town’s remedies. Upon the occurrence of any event of default or at any
time thereafter, the town may, at its option and from time to time, exercise at
wireless provider’s expense any or all or any combination of the following
cumulative remedies in any order and repetitively at the town’s option:
   1.   Terminate the telecom license agreement and right-of-way permits issued
to the wireless provider due to wireless provider’s breach; provided, however,
that this shall not terminate wireless provider’s obligations arising during
the time simultaneous with or prior to or the termination, and in no way
eliminates or reduces wireless provider’s liability resulting from the breach.
   2.   Pay or perform, for wireless provider’s account, in wireless provider’s
name, and at wireless provider’s expense, any or all payments or performances
required under these standard terms to be paid or performed by wireless
provider.
   3.   Abate at wireless provider’s expense any violation of these standard
terms.
   4.   Notwithstanding anything under these standard terms to the contrary,
unilaterally and without wireless provider’s or any other person’s consent or
approval, draw upon, withdraw or otherwise realize upon or obtain the value of
any letter of credit, escrowed funds, insurance policies, or other deposits,
sureties, bonds or other funds or security held by the town or pledged or
otherwise obligated to the town by wireless provider or by any third party
(whether or not specifically mentioned herein) and use the proceeds for any
remedy permitted by these standard terms.
   5.   Require an additional security deposit adequate in the town’s sole
discretion to protect the town and the right-of-way.
   6.   Assert, exercise or otherwise pursue at wireless provider’s expense any
and all other rights or remedies, legal or equitable, to which the town may be
entitled, subject only to the limitation set out below on the town’s ability to
collect money damages in light of the violation use fee.
C.   Violation use fee. In lieu of certain money damages (the “inconvenience
costs”) set out below, the following shall apply to wireless provider’s
violation of certain limited requirements of these standard terms ( the
“violation fee provisions”):
   1.   The inconvenience costs are the money damages that the town suffers in
the form of administrative cost and inconvenience, disharmony among competing
users, and general inconvenience in right-of-way use by the town, competing
users and the public when wireless provider fails to comply with the violation
fee provisions.
   2.   Wireless provider’s failure to comply with violation fee provisions
will result in inconvenience costs in an amount that is and will be
impracticable to determine. Therefore, the parties have agreed that, in lieu of
wireless provider paying to the town as damages the actual amount of the
inconvenience costs for violating the violation fee provisions, wireless
provider shall pay the violation use fee.
   3.   The violation use fee is only intended to remedy inconvenience costs
that the town suffers because of wireless provider’s breach of the violation
fee provisions. Wireless provider’s payment of a violation use fee does not in
any way excuse any breach by wireless provider of these standard terms or limit
in any way wireless provider’s obtaining any other legal or equitable remedy
provided by these standard terms or otherwise for such breach. For example,
wireless provider’s obligation to pay the violation use fee does not in any way
detract from wireless provider’s indemnity and insurance obligations under
these standard terms, which shall apply according to their terms in addition to
wireless provider’s obligation to pay the violation use fee.
   4.   Wireless provider may elect to draw upon the letter of credit to
collect the violation use fee.
   5.   The violation fee per day is an amount established by a fee schedule
adopted by the council and amended from time to time.
   6.   Violation use fees shall be assessed as follows:
      a.   If the town determines that wireless provider is liable for a
violation use fee, then the town shall issue to wireless provider a notice of
the town’s assessing a violation use fee. The notice shall set forth the nature
of the violation and the amount of the assessment.
      b.   Wireless provider shall pay the violation use fee within ten days
after the town’s notice unless the violation use fee amount exceeds $5,000, in
which case the following shall apply:
         i.   Wireless provider shall have 30 days after the notice to pay the
violation use fee or give the town notice contesting the assertion of
noncompliance.
         ii.   If wireless provider fails to respond to the notice, wireless
provider shall pay the violation use fee. Otherwise, the town shall schedule a
public hearing to investigate whether the violation use fee is properly
assessed. The town shall provide wireless provider at least ten days’ notice of
such hearing, which shall specify the time, place and purpose of the hearing.
At the hearing, wireless provider shall be provided an opportunity to be heard
and present evidence. If the result of the hearing is that wireless provider is
liable for the violation use fee, then the violation use fee is due ten days
after the hearing decision is announced.
D.   Non-waiver. Wireless provider acknowledges wireless provider’s
unconditional obligation to comply with these standard terms. No failure by the
town to demand any performance required of wireless provider under these
standard terms, and no acceptance by the town of any imperfect or partial
performances under these standard terms, shall excuse such performance or
impair in any way the town’s ability to insist, prospectively and
retroactively, upon full compliance with these standard terms. No acceptance by
the town of use fee payments or other performances under this
chapter 12-8 and the approved telecom license agreement shall be deemed a
compromise or settlement of any right the town may have for additional,
different or further payments or performances as provided for in these standard
terms. Any waiver by the town of any breach of condition or covenant set forth
in
chapter 12-8 or the approved telecom license agreement shall not be deemed or
considered as a continuing waiver and shall not operate to bar or otherwise
prevent the town from declaring a default for any breach or succeeding or
continuing breach either of the same condition or covenant or otherwise. No
statement, bill or notice by the town or wireless provider concerning payments
or other performances due under
chapter 12-8 or the approved telecom license agreement, or failure by the town
to demand any performance under
chapter 12-8 or the approved telecom license agreement, shall excuse wireless
provider from compliance with its obligations nor estop the town (or otherwise
impair the town’s ability) to at any time correct such notice and/or insist
prospectively and retroactively upon full compliance with the telecom license
agreement. No waiver of any description (including any waiver of this sentence
or paragraph) shall be effective against the town unless made in writing by a
duly authorized representative of the town specifically identifying the
particular provision being waived and specifically stating the scope of the
waiver. Wireless provider expressly disclaims and shall not have the right to
rely on any supposed waiver or other change or modification, whether by word or
conduct or otherwise, not conforming to this paragraph.
E.   Reimbursement of the town’s expenses. Wireless provider shall pay to the
town within 30 days after the town’s demand any and all amounts expended or
incurred by the town in performing wireless provider’s obligations (upon
wireless provider’s failure to perform the same after notice from the town)
together with interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum from the date
expended or incurred by the town.
F.   Breach by the town. Notwithstanding anything in these standard terms to
the contrary, if the town at any time is required to pay to wireless provider
any amount or render any performance, such amount or performance is not due
until 30 days after notice by wireless provider to the town that the amount has
become payable or that the performance is due. In the event a cure cannot be
effected during that period, the town shall not be in default so long as the
town commences cure during the period and diligently prosecutes the cure to
completion provided such cure must be completed within 60 days after the
notice.
G.   Right to setoff and credit. In addition to its other rights and remedies
the town shall have the right to setoff and credit from time to time and at any
time, any and all amounts due from wireless provider to the town, whether
pursuant to these standard terms or otherwise, against any sum which may be due
from the town to wireless provider.
12-8-16 Termination
The following provisions shall apply at the expiration of the term of the
telecom license agreement:
A.   Surviving obligations. Expiration or termination of the telecom license
agreement does not terminate wireless provider’s obligations existing or
arising prior to or simultaneous with, or attributable to, the termination or
events leading to or occurring before termination.
B.   Delivery of possession. Wireless provider shall cease using the use area
of the expired or terminated telecom license agreement. Wireless provider shall
without demand, peaceably and quietly quit and deliver up the use area to the
town thoroughly cleaned, in good repair with the use area maintained and
repaired and in as good order and condition, reasonable use and wear excepted,
as prior to wireless provider’s activities.
C.   Confirmation of termination. Upon expiration or termination of a telecom
license agreement for any reason, wireless provider shall provide to the town
upon demand recordable disclaimers covering the use area executed and
acknowledged by wireless provider and by all persons claiming through these
standard terms, the telecom license agreement, any right-of-way permit, or
wireless provider any interest in or right to use the use area.
D.   Removal of improvements. Wireless provider shall remove all communications
equipment and restore the use area including pole, mast arms, luminaires, or
wireless support structure to its prior condition, or to a condition matching
the town’s surrounding land and improvements, as directed by the town, at
wireless provider’s expense prior to normal expiration of the term of a telecom
license agreement, or within 90 days after full or partial termination of a
telecom license agreement for any other reason whatsoever. Without limitation,
such work shall include revegetation and appropriate irrigation systems for
revegetated areas. Notwithstanding anything in these standard terms to the
contrary, the town may elect to require wireless provider to leave any or all
construction or other items (except the communications equipment) in place, and
all such items shall be owned by the town. Unless the town directs otherwise,
all wiring, pipes and conduits shall be left in good and safe condition, in
working order, with each end properly labeled and enclosed in proper junction
boxes.
E.   Prior improvements. This article also applies to any improvements that
wireless provider may have made to the use area.
12-8-17 Indemnity and insurance
During the entire term of the telecom license agreement, wireless provider
shall insure its property and activities at and about the use area and shall
provide insurance and indemnification as follows:
A.   Insurance required. Not later than the date of the telecom license

using the use area in any way, wireless provider shall obtain and cause to be
in force and effect the following insurance:
   1.   Commercial general liability. Commercial general liability insurance
with a limit of $10,000,000 for each occurrence, a limit of $10,000,000 for
products and completed operations annual aggregate, and a limit of $10,000,000
general aggregate limit per policy year. The policy shall cover liability
arising from premises, operations, independent contractors, products, completed
operations, personal injury, bodily injury, advertising injury, and liability
assumed under an “insured contract” including the telecom license agreement.
The policy will cover wireless provider’s liability under the indemnity
provisions set forth in these standard terms. The policy shall contain a
“separation of insured’s” clause.
   2.   Automobile liability. Automobile liability insurance with a limit of
$1,000,000 for each occurrence covering any and all owned, hired, and non-owned
vehicles assigned to or used in any way in connection with wireless provider’s
use of the right-of-way. Without limitation, such insurance shall cover hazards
of motor vehicle use for loading and off-loading.
   3.   Workers’ compensation. Such workers’ compensation and similar insurance
as is required by law and employer’s liability insurance with a minimum limit
of $100,000 for each accident, $100,000 disease for each employee, $500,000
policy limit for disease. All contractors and subcontractors must provide like
insurance.
   4.   Special risk property. Unless waived by the town in writing, all risk
property insurance covering damage to or destruction of all real and personal
improvements to the right-of-way, including without limitation all improvements
existing upon the right-of-way or constructed after the telecom license
agreement or right-of-way permit is in effect, shall be effective and in force
prior to the effective date of an approved telecom license agreement or right-
of-way permit, in an amount equal to full replacement cost of all such
improvements. The insurance shall be special causes of loss policy form
(minimally including perils of fire, lightning, explosion, windstorm, hail,
smoke, aircraft, vehicles, riot, civil commotion, theft, vandalism, malicious
mischief, collapse and flood). Coverage shall include pollutant clean up and
removal with minimum limits coverage of $50,000.
   5.   Other insurance. Any other insurance the town may reasonably require
for the protection of the town and the town’s employees, officials,
representatives, officers and agents (all of whom, including the town, are
collectively “additional insureds”), the right-of-way, surrounding property,
wireless provider, or the activities carried on or about the right-of-way. Such
insurance shall be limited to insurance a reasonable person owning, leasing,
designing, constructing, occupying, or operating similar facilities might
reasonably purchase.
B.   Policy limit escalation. The town may elect by notice to wireless provider
to increase the amount or type of any insurance to account for inflation,
changes in risk, or any other factor that the town reasonably determines to
affect the prudent amount of insurance to be provided.
C.   Form of all insurance. All insurance provided by wireless provider with
respect to the right-of-way, whether required in these standard terms or not,
shall meet the following requirements:
   1.   “Occurrence” coverage is required.
   2.   If wireless provider uses any excess insurance then such excess
insurance shall be “follow form” equal to or broader in coverage than the
underlying insurance.
   3.   Policies must also cover and insure wireless provider’s activities
relating to the business operations and activities conducted away from the
right-of-way.
   4.   Within five business days of receiving a written request from the town,
wireless provider shall provide copies of insurance certificates, insurance
policies, formal endorsements or other documentation acceptable to the town
that all insurance coverage required herein is provided.
   5.   Wireless provider’s insurance shall be primary insurance with respect
to claims arising out of wireless provider’s operations, activities and
obligations set forth in these standard terms.
   6.   All policies, including workers’ compensation, shall waive transfer
rights of recovery (subrogation) against the town, and the other additional
insureds.
   7.   All deductibles, retentions, or “self-insured” amounts shall be subject
to the following:
      a.   Wireless provider shall be solely responsible for any self-insurance
amount or deductible.
      b.   Such amounts shall not exceed in total $100,000 per loss. At such
times as wireless provider’s net worth is more than $100,000,000, such limit
shall be $1,000,000.
      c.   Any self-insured exposure shall be deemed to be an insured risk
under the telecom license agreement.
      d.   Wireless provider shall provide to the beneficiaries of all such
amounts no less insurance protection than if such self-insured portion was
fully insured by an insurance company of the quality and caliber required this
section.
      e.   The right to self-insure is limited and specific to wireless
provider and does not extend to wireless provider’s contractors or others.
   8.   All policies except workers’ compensation must name the town and the
other additional insureds as additional insureds. Wireless provider shall cause
coverage for additional insureds to be incorporated into each insurance policy
by endorsement with respect to claims arising out of wireless provider’s
operations, activities and obligations under these standard terms.
   9.   All policies must require the insurer to provide the town with at least
30 days’ prior notice of any cancellation. The insurer’s duty to notify the
town of changes in coverage shall not include phrases such as “endeavor to” or
“but failure to mail such notice shall impose no obligation or liability of any
kind upon the company, its agents or representatives.”
   10.   All policies shall require that notices be given to the town in the
manner specified for notices to the town set forth in these standard terms.
D.   Insurance certificates. Wireless provider shall evidence all insurance by
furnishing to the town certificates of insurance annually and with each change
in insurance coverage. Certificates must evidence that the policy described by
the certificate is in full force and effect and that the policy satisfies each
requirement of these standard terms applicable to the policy. For example,
certificates must evidence that the town and the other additional insureds are
additional insureds. Certificates must also be in an industry standard form
reasonably acceptable to the town. Wireless provider shall provide updated
certificates at the town’s request.
E.   Acceptable insurers. All insurance policies shall be issued by insurers
acceptable to the town. At a minimum, all insurers shall be duly licensed (or
qualified unlicensed non-admitted insurer) by the state of Arizona, department
of insurance. At a minimum, all insurers shall have and maintain an A.M. Best,
Inc. rating of B++ 6.
F.   No representation of coverage adequacy. By requiring insurance, the town
does not represent that coverage and limits will be adequate to protect
wireless provider. The town reserves the right to review any and all of the
insurance policies and/or endorsements cited in these standard terms but has no
obligation to do so. Failure to demand such evidence of full compliance with
the insurance requirements set forth in these standard terms or failure to
identify any insurance deficiency shall not relieve wireless provider from, nor
be construed or deemed a waiver of, wireless provider’s obligation to maintain
the required insurance at all times.
G.   Indemnity. In addition to all other indemnities and other obligations
hereunder, to the fullest extent permitted by law, throughout the term of each
telecom license agreement and right-of-way permit and until all obligations and
performances under or related to these standard terms are satisfied and all
matters described in this paragraph are completely resolved, wireless provider
and all other persons using, acting, working or claiming through or for
wireless provider (if they or their subcontractor, employee or other person or
entity hired or directed by them participated in any way in causing the claim
in question)) shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the town and all other additional insureds for, from and against any and all
claims or harm related to wireless provider’s use of the right-of-way or the
rights granted to wireless provider with respect to the right-of-way or
wireless provider’s exercise of its rights under these standard terms (the
“indemnity”). Without limitation, the Indemnity shall include and apply to any
and all allegations, demands, judgments, assessments, taxes, impositions,
expenses, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, suits, actions, claims
(including without limitation claims of personal injury, bodily injury,
sickness, disease, death, property damage, destruction, loss of use, financial
harm, or other impairment), damages, losses, expenses, penalties, fines or
other matters (together with all attorney fees, court costs, and the cost of
appellate proceedings and all other costs and expenses of litigation or
resolving the claim) that may arise in any manner out of any use of the right-
of-way or other property pursuant to any telecom license agreement or right-of-
way permit or any actions, acts, errors, mistakes or omissions relating to work
or services in the performance of or related to the telecom license agreement
or right-of-way permit, including without limitation any injury or damages or
cause of action claimed or caused by any employees, contractors,
subcontractors, tenants, subtenants, agents or other persons upon or using the
right-of-way or surrounding areas related to wireless provider’s exercise of
its rights under the telecom license agreement, including without limitation,
claims, liability, harm or damages caused in part by the town or any other
additional insured or anyone for whose mistakes, errors, omissions or
negligence wireless provider or the town may be liable. As a condition to the
town’s approval of any telecom license agreement or right-of-way permit,
wireless provider specifically agrees that to the extent any provision of this
paragraph is not fully enforceable against wireless provider for any reason
whatsoever, this paragraph shall be deemed automatically reformed to the
minimal extent necessary to cause it to be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law. The indemnity shall also include and apply to any
environmental injury, personal injury or other liability relating to wireless
provider’s use of real property under each right-of-way permit. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnity does not apply to:
   1.   Claims arising only from the sole gross negligence or intentionally
wrongful acts of the town.
   2.   Claims that the law prohibits from being imposed upon the indemnitor.
H.   Risk of Loss. Wireless provider assumes the risk of any and all loss,
damage or claims related to wireless provider’s use of the right-of-way or
other property of the town, wireless provider or third parties throughout the
term of any telecom license agreement or right-of-way permit. Wireless provider
shall be responsible for any and all damage to its property and equipment
related to these standard terms.
I.   Insurance to be provided by others. Wireless provider shall cause its
contractors or other persons occupying, working on or about, or using the
right-of-way pursuant to these standard terms to be covered by their own or
wireless provider’s insurance as required by these standard terms. The required
policy limits for commercial general liability insurance provided by such
persons shall be $1,000,000 for each occurrence, $1,000,000 for products and
completed operations annual aggregate, and $2,000,000 general aggregate limit
per policy year. This paragraph does not apply to persons who do not actually
perform physical labor in the right-of-way (such as wireless provider’s
consulting design engineers).
12-8-18 Condemnation
This section governs any condemnation of any part of or interest in the use
area and any conveyance to the town or another condemnor in avoidance or
settlement of condemnation or a threat of condemnation.
A.   Termination for condemnation. The wireless provider’s right to use the use
area shall terminate on the date that is the earlier of the date title vests in
the condemnor, or the date upon which the condemnor is let into possession.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the town reasonably determines that the use
area continues to be suitable for wireless provider to conduct the permitted
uses, the town may elect to cause the telecom license agreement to continue to
remain in effect as to the part of the use area not taken and the use fee shall
not be reduced or abated. Nevertheless, if wireless provider reasonably
determines that the use area is not suitable for wireless provider to conduct
the permitted uses, then the wireless provider’s right to use that use area
shall terminate when wireless provider gives written notice to the town
engineer of the termination of the telecom license agreement as to that use
area.
B.   Condemnation proceeds. Wireless provider hereby assigns and transfers to
the town wireless provider’s entire interest in all condemnation damages,
interest, severance damages, and any other payments or proceeds of any kind
relating to the condemnation (collectively the “condemnation proceeds”).
Wireless provider shall execute and deliver to the town assignments or other
instruments requested by the town confirming such assignment and transfer.
Wireless provider shall immediately pay to the town any condemnation proceeds
wireless provider may receive. The condemnation proceeds shall not include
relocation benefits, if any, awarded specifically to wireless provider to cover
expenses of relocating wireless provider’s business located at the use area at
the time of the condemnation, or any compensation specifically awarded to
wireless provider for any taking of the communications equipment itself. Any
repair, relocation or similar costs relating to the communications equipment
shall be borne by wireless provider.
C.   Power to condemn. Wireless provider acknowledges that the town and others
from time-to-time may use the power to condemn the use area or any interest in
it. The town has not relinquished any right of condemnation or eminent domain
over the use area. The town does not warrant that the town will not condemn the
use area during the term of the telecom license agreement, but (unless the
town’s representatives state otherwise at the time of the right-of-way permit
issuance) the town represents by its issuance of the right-of-way permit that
it does not presently have intentions to condemn the use area.
12-8-19 Damage to or destruction of the use area
This section governs damage to or destruction of the use area by fire, flood,
explosion, the elements, the public enemy, or other casualty (collectively
“casualty damage”):
A.   Damage to wireless provider’s improvements. Wireless provider shall
commence restoring the casualty damage to wireless provider’s improvements
within 30 days after any casualty damage occurs. Wireless provider shall
complete the restoration work within 30 days after commencement. The work shall
be subject to the plans approval process and all other requirements for
wireless provider’s improvements. Wireless provider shall perform all
restoration work at wireless provider’s sole cost and expense.
B.   Monthly restoration work report. Wireless provider shall provide to the
town no later than the tenth day of each month a written narrative report of
the progress of the restoration work.
12-8-20 Wireless provider’s records
During the entire term of the telecom license agreement, wireless provider
shall keep records and provide information to the town as provided in this
section.
A.   Scope of information. Unless otherwise specified, all of wireless
provider’s recordkeeping and disclosure obligations under this article are
limited to the following (collectively the “covered information”):
   1.   The status of the construction, repair or restoration of wireless
provider improvements.
   2.   Information indicating whether the town or wireless provider is in
compliance with the terms of this chapter, all other applicable provisions of
the town code, and the telecom license agreement.
   3.   Records inspection. At wireless provider’s expense, wireless provider
shall:
      a.   Permit and assist the town and its representatives upon 21 days’
notice to inspect, audit, and copy wireless provider’s records of covered
information.
      b.   Make the records of covered information (and reasonable
accommodations for the town’s audit and inspection) available to the town at
wireless provider’s Arizona offices.
      c.   Cause wireless provider’s employees and agents and accountants to
give their full cooperation and assistance in connection with the town’s access
to the covered information.
B.   Record retention. Wireless provider shall preserve records of the covered
information in a secure place at wireless provider’s corporate headquarters in
the continental United States for a period ending seven years after the time
period reported by the records.
C.   Record media included. The town’s and wireless provider’s rights and
obligations regarding the covered information apply regardless of the type of
media, materials, or data repositories that may contain the covered
information. The town shall have access to covered information contained,
without limitation, in records, books, papers, documents, recordings, computer
data, contracts, logs, notes, ledgers, correspondence, reports, drawings, and
memoranda, and any and all other sources, records and repositories of covered
information.
D.   Reports. Wireless provider shall deliver to the town written reports (and,
if requested by the town, a presentation to the town’s governing council or
designee) covering such covered information as the town may request from time
to time. The town shall not request such reports more often than once in any
12-month period.
E.   Standards for records. Wireless provider shall maintain a standard, modern
system of recordkeeping for the covered information and shall keep and maintain
proper and accurate books and other repositories of information relating to the
covered information.
12-8-21 Compliance with law
Wireless provider shall perform its obligations under these standard terms in
accordance with all federal, state, county and local laws, ordinances,
regulations or other rules or policies as are now in effect or as may hereafter
be adopted or amended. Without limiting in any way the generality of the
foregoing, wireless provider shall comply with all and each of the provisions
set forth in this section.
A.   Applicability of municipal law. Without limitation, wireless provider
shall comply with municipal laws as follows:
   1.   Wireless provider acknowledges nothing set forth in this
chapter 12-8 or in the telecom license agreement or any right-of-way permit
constitutes, and the town has not promised or offered, any type of waiver of,
or agreement to waive (or show any type of forbearance, priority or favoritism
to wireless provider with regard to) any law, ordinance, power, regulation,
tax, assessment or other legal requirement now or hereafter imposed by the town
or any other governmental body upon or affecting wireless provider, the use
area, or the right-of-way or wireless provider’s use of the use area, or the
right-of-way.
   2.   All of wireless provider’s obligations hereunder are in addition to,
and cumulative upon (and not to any extent in substitution or satisfaction of),
all existing or future laws and regulations applicable to wireless provider.
   3.   The town, by entering into the telecom license agreement or issuing a
right-of-way permit, cannot and has not relinquished or limited any right of
condemnation or eminent domain over the use area or any other property related
to these standard terms or within the right-of-way.
   4.   A telecom license agreement or right-of-way permit cannot and does not
impair the town’s, power to enact, apply or enforce any laws or regulations, or
exercise any governmental powers affecting in any way wireless provider, any
use area, or the right-of-way.
   5.   The town’s rights and remedies under the telecom license agreement and
any right-of-way permit for wireless provider’s failure to comply with all
applicable laws supplement and are in addition to and do not replace otherwise
existing powers of the town or any other governmental body.
   6.   Wireless provider’s rights under the telecom license agreement and any
right-of-way permit are further subject to all present and future building
restrictions, regulations, zoning laws, and all ordinances, resolutions, rules
and orders of all bodies, bureaus, commissions and bodies of any municipal,
county, state, or federal authority, now or hereafter having jurisdiction over
any use area or wireless provider’s use of any use area. Wireless provider
shall comply with all of the foregoing.
B.   Radio frequency compliance requirements. Wireless provider shall document,
report and confirm its compliance with FCC radio frequency exposure guidelines
(FCC OET bulletin 65) and all other FCC rules as follows:
   1.   Wireless provider shall cause its senior internal engineer responsible
for compliance with the FCC rules to deliver to the town a letter attesting
that wireless provider’s operation of the communications equipment is in
compliance with the FCC rules. A statement from wireless provider declaring
exemption from reporting to FCC is not acceptable to comply with the
requirements of this paragraph.
   2.   Wireless provider shall maintain records of radio frequency
measurements and communications equipment performance in accordance with the
FCC rules.
   3.   Wireless provider shall also evidence and demonstrate its compliance
with the FCC rules in such manner and at such intervals as the town code and
other applicable laws and regulations may mandate.
C.   Government property lease excise tax. Wireless provider shall be
responsible for any and all property taxes and all government property lease
excise taxes described in A.R.S. § 42-6201 et seq. or similar laws in force
from time to time. Pursuant to A.R.S. § 42-6206, failure by wireless provider
to pay the taxes after notice and an opportunity to cure is an event of default
that could result in divesting wireless provider of any interest in or right of
occupancy of the use area.
D.   Use area regulations. The town reserves the right to adopt, amend and
enforce against wireless provider rules and regulations governing the operation
of the right-of-way, including the use area, wireless provider’s activities on
them, and the public areas and facilities used by wireless provider in
connection with them.
E.   Taxes, liens and assessments. In addition to all other amounts provided in
this
chapter 12-8 and in the telecom license agreement and any right-of-way permit,
and to the extent consistent with applicable law, wireless provider shall pay,
when they become due and payable, all taxes and general and special fees,
charges and assessments of every description that during the term of any
telecom license agreement or right-of-way permit may be levied upon or assessed
upon or with respect to wireless provider’s use of the right-of-way, the
operations conducted there, any amounts paid or other performances required by
these standard terms by either party, and all possessory interest in the right-
of-way and wireless provider’s improvements and other property located there.
Wireless provider shall pay, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the town from
any and all obligations, including any interest, penalties and other expenses
which may be imposed, and from any lien or sale or other proceedings to enforce
their payment.
F.   Permits. Nothing in these standard terms relieves wireless provider of the
obligation to obtain permits, licenses and other approvals from the town or
other units of government that are required for the erection, construction,
reconstruction, installation, operation or maintenance of the communications
equipment or provision of telecommunications services; or from compliance with
applicable municipal codes, ordinances, laws and policies, such as zoning and
land use ordinances and regulations, pavement cut and restoration ordinances
and regulations, subdivision and project improvement ordinances, curb cut
permits, building permits, right-of-way permits and the like.
12-8-22 Assignment
Telecom license agreements and right-of-way permits are not assignable by
wireless provider (and any assignment shall be void and vest no rights in the
purported assignee) unless the assignment is made in strict compliance with the
requirements of this section.
A.   Assignments affected. Every assignment of any of wireless provider’s
interest in the right-of-way, the telecom license agreement, any right-of-way
permit, or any of wireless provider’s rights or interests under this
chapter 12-8 is prohibited unless wireless provider first receives from the
town notice of the town’s consent to the assignment. The town’s consent to
assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. All
references in these standard terms to assignments by wireless provider or to
assignees shall be deemed also to apply to all of the following transactions,
circumstances and conditions and to all persons claiming pursuant to such
transactions, circumstances and conditions:
   1.   Any voluntary or involuntary assignment, conveyance or transfer of
wireless provider’s right to use the right-of-way under the telecom license
agreement or any right-of-way permit, or any interest or rights of the town
under the telecom license agreement or any right-of-way permit, in whole or in
part.
   2.   Any voluntary or involuntary pledge, lien, mortgage, security interest,
judgment, claim or demand, whether arising from any contract, any agreement,
any work of construction, repair, restoration, maintenance or removal, or
otherwise affecting wireless provider’s rights to use the right-of-way
(collectively “liens”).
   3.   Any voluntary or involuntary assignment by wireless provider of any
interest in the telecom license agreement or any right-of-way permit for the
benefit of creditors.
   4.   A wireless provider insolvency.
   5.   The occurrence of any of the foregoing by operation of law or
otherwise.
   6.   The occurrence of any of the foregoing with respect to any assignee or
other successor to wireless provider.
B.   Pre-approved assignments. Subject to certain conditions hereafter stated,
the town hereby consents to certain assignments (the “pre-approved
assignments”). Only the following assignments are pre-approved assignments:
   1.   Complete assignment of telecom license agreement. Wireless provider’s
complete assignment of all of wireless provider’s rights and interests in the
telecom license agreement and associated use areas to a single assignee who
meets all of the following requirements, as determined by the town in the
town’s reasonable discretion (a “qualified operator”):
      a.   The assignee has experience, management, credit standing and
financial capacity and other resources equal to or greater than wireless
provider’s and adequate to successfully perform the obligations set forth
herein.
      b.   The assignee is experienced in the management and operation of
similar projects.
      c.   The assignee assumes all of wireless provider’s obligations under
the telecom license agreement.
      d.   The assignee has a net worth of not less than $50,000,000.
   2.   Stock transfers. The transfer of publicly traded stock, regardless of
quantity.
   3.   Merger. The merger or consolidation of wireless provider with another
entity that is a qualified operator.
   4.   Common ownership transfer. Wireless provider’s complete assignment of
all of wireless provider’s rights and interests in the telecom license
agreement and associated use areas to single assignee who is and remains a
wholly owned subsidiary of wireless provider’s sole owner as of the date of the
telecom license agreement (or a wholly owned subsidiary of a wholly owned
subsidiary of wireless provider’s sole owner as of the date of the telecom
license agreement).
C.   Limitations on assignments. The town’s consent to any assignment,
including without limitation, pre-approved assignments, is not effective until
the following conditions are satisfied:
   1.   Except for the sale of stock, wireless provider shall provide to the
town a summary of provisions of the transaction documents assigning its
interests.
   2.   Each assignee must execute an assumption of the telecom license
agreement in substantially the form set forth in section
12-8-26 (forms).
   3.   Each pre-approved assignment must satisfy all other requirements of
these standard terms pertaining to assignments.
D.   Assignment remedies. Any assignment without the town’s consent shall be
void and shall not result in the assignee obtaining any rights or interests.
The town may, in its sole discretion and in addition to all other remedies
available to the town under these standard terms or otherwise, and in any
combination, terminate the telecom license agreement and any and all right-of-
way permits, collect use fee from the assignee and/or declare the assignment to
be void, all without prejudicing any other right or remedy of the town under
these standard terms. No cure or grace periods shall apply to assignments
prohibited under these standard terms or to enforcement of any provision under
these standard terms against an assignee who did not receive the town’s
consent.
E.   Effect of assignment. Prior to any assignment, each assignee must execute
an assumption of the telecom license agreement in the form set forth in section
12-8-26. No action or inaction by the town shall be deemed a waiver of the
prohibition on assignments or any other provision herein, or the acceptance of
the assignee, wireless provider or occupant as wireless provider, or a release
of wireless provider from the further performance by wireless provider of the
provisions of the telecom license agreement or any right-of-way permit. Consent
by the town to an assignment shall not relieve wireless provider from obtaining
the town’s consent to any further assignment. No assignment shall release
wireless provider from any liability under this
chapter 12-8 or the telecom license agreement.
F.   Enforceability after assignment. No consent by the town shall be deemed to
be a novation. The town’s consent to any assignment does not in any way expand
or modify the terms set forth in these standard terms or waive, diminish or
modify any of the town’s rights or remedies under the telecom license agreement
or any right-of-way permit. The terms set forth in these standard terms shall
be enforceable against wireless provider and each successor, partial or total,
and regardless of the method of succession, to wireless provider’s interest
under this
chapter 12-8 or the telecom license agreement. Each successor having actual or
constructive notice of the telecom license agreement or any right-of-way permit
shall be deemed to have agreed to the preceding sentence.
G.   Grounds for refusal. Except for the pre-approved assignments, no
assignment of any telecom license agreement by wireless provider is
contemplated or bargained for. Without limitation, the town has the right to
impose upon any consent to assignment such conditions and requirements as the
town may deem appropriate.
H.   Consent to assignments. Wireless provider shall attach to each pre-
approved assignment a copy of wireless provider’s notice to the town of the
pre-approved assignment and other required documents, wireless provider shall
attach to each other assignment, a copy of the town’s notice to wireless
provider of the town’s consent to the assignment. These standard terms shall
continue to be enforceable according to its terms in spite of any provisions of
any documents relating to an assignment.
I.   Assignment fee. Wireless provider shall pay to the town in advance a
nonrefundable fee in an amount established by a fee schedule adopted by the
council and amended from time to time for legal, administrative and other
expenses related to every pre-approved assignment of any license agreement
(other than the sale of publicly traded stock) or to any request for a consent
to assignment, whether or not the town grants the request.
12-8-23 Miscellaneous
The additional provisions set forth in this section apply to each and every
telecom license agreement and right-of-way permit.
A.   Amendments. These standard terms may not be amended except by a formal
writing executed by all of the parties.
B.   Dates. Any reference to a year shall refer to a calendar year unless a
fiscal year is specifically stated. Sunday, Saturday and Arizona legal holidays
are holidays.
C.   Time of essence. Time is of the essence of each and every provision of
this
chapter 12-8, the telecom license agreement, and any right-of-way permit.
D.   Severability. If any provision of these standard terms shall be ruled by a
court or agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for
any reason, then:
   1.   The invalidity or unenforceability of the provision shall not affect
the validity of any remaining provisions of these standard terms.
   2.   These standard terms shall be automatically reformed to secure to the
parties the benefits of the unenforceable provision, to the maximum extent
consistent with law.
E.   Conflicts of interest. No officer, representative or employee of the town
shall have any direct or indirect interest in the telecom license agreement or
any right-of-way permit, or participate in any decision relating to any telecom
license agreement or right-of-way permit that is prohibited by law.
F.   No partnership. The transactions and performances contemplated hereby
shall not create any sort of partnership, joint venture or similar relationship
between the parties.
G.   Nonliability of officials and employees. No official, representative or
employee of the town shall be personally liable to any party, or to any
successor in interest to any party, in the event of any default or breach by

14-5-4 Nonpayment of delinquent bill; filing of lien; interest
A.   If any bill for a utility rate, charge or fee made to the customer
pursuant to this title is not paid by the next billing date, the customer shall
be given written notice specifying that the bill is delinquent and outlining
the procedure by which the customer may challenge the accuracy of the bill. If
a delinquent bill is not paid and no challenge has been made to the accuracy of
the bill after the notice of delinquency, the water supply will, without
further notice, be turned off, and not turned on until all sums due are paid in
full, together with a charge for reconnection after delinquency as provided in
chapter 14-6.
B.   Pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-511.02, the town may file a lien on the property

provided the customer pays the meter re-read charge or the meter test charge in
advance in the amount established by a fee established by the schedule adopted
by the council and amended from time to time. A request for meter re-read or
meter test, paid for by the customer, shall constitute a challenge to the
accuracy of the bill.
   3.   The town shall send the customer a corrected bill and refund the cost
of the meter re-read or meter test if the bill is found to be in error either
because the meter was misread or because a meter test shows that the meter
over-calculated the volume by more than 3%. Customer shall have 20 days to pay
the corrected bill.
   4.   The water director is authorized to negotiate a mediation process
mutually acceptable to the water director and the customer. The customer shall
deposit the full estimated cost of the mediation process with the water
department. The mediation shall make a final determination of the validity of
the customer’s challenge and whether the town should be required to pay all or
a portion of the cost of the mediation process.
   5.   The customer’s utility service shall not be terminated during the
mediation process.

assembly or method without the approval of the water department.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified paragraphs B and E by changing “utilities
department” to “water department”
14-8-7 Installation of backflow prevention assemblies for fire systems
In addition to the requirements of section
14-8-5, the following shall also apply:
A.   Fire protection systems consist of sprinklers, hose connections, and
hydrants. Sprinkler systems may be dry or wet, open or closed. Systems of
fixed-spray nozzles may be used indoors or outdoors for protection of
flammable-liquid and other hazardous processes. It is standard practice,
especially in towns, to equip automatic sprinkler systems with fire department
pumper connections.
B.   A meter (compound, detector check) should not normally be permitted as
part of a backflow prevention assembly. An exception may be made, however, if
the meter and backflow prevention assembly are specifically designed for that
purpose.
C.   For cross-connection control, fire protection systems shall be classified
on the basis of water source and arrangement of supplies as follows:
   1.   Class 1: direct connections from public water mains only; no pumps,
tanks, or reservoirs; no physical connection from other water supplies; no
antifreeze or other additives of any kind; all sprinkler drains discharging to
atmosphere, dry wells, or other safe outlets.
   2.   Class 2: same as class 1, except that booster pumps may be installed in
the connections from the street mains. Booster pumps do not affect the
potability of the system; it is necessary, however, to avoid drafting so much
water that pressure in the water main is reduced below 20 psi.
   3.   Class 3: direct connection from public water supply main plus one or
more of the following: elevated storage tanks; fire pumps taking suction from
above-ground covered reservoirs or tanks; and pressure tanks (all storage
facilities are filled or connected to public water only, the water in the tanks
to be maintained in a potable condition.) Otherwise, class 3 systems are the
same as class 1 systems. Class 3 systems will generally require minimum
protection (approved double check valves) to prevent stagnant waters from
backflowing into the public potable water system.
   4.   Class 4: directly supplied from public mains similar to classes 1 and
2, and with the auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises; or an
auxiliary supply may be located within 1,700 feet of the pumper connection.
Class 4 systems will normally require backflow protection at the service
connection. The type (air gap or RPA) will generally depend on the quality of
the auxiliary supply.
   5.   Class 5: directly supplied from public mains, and interconnected with
auxiliary supplies, such as pumps taking suction from reservoirs exposed to
contamination, or rivers and ponds; driven wells, mills or other industrial
water systems; or where antifreeze or other additives are used. Class 4 and 5
systems normally would need maximum protection (air gap or RPA) to protect the
public potable water system.
   6.   Class 6: combined industrial and fire protection systems supplied from
the public water mains only, with or without gravity storage or pump suction
tanks. Class 6 system protection would depend on the requirements of both
industry and fire protection, and could only be determined by a survey of the
premises.
D.   When a backflow prevention assembly is required for a water service
connection supplying water only to a fire system, the assembly shall be
installed on the service line in compliance with standard specifications
adopted by the town. (Installation of DCVAs or DDCVAs in a vertical position on
the riser may be allowed on fire systems with the approval of the water
director.)
Ordinance 2015.015 modified paragraph D by changing “utilities director” to

14-8-8 Inspections
A customer’s water system shall be available at all times during business
operations for premises inspection by the water department. The inspection
shall be conducted to determine whether any cross-connection or other hazard
potentials exist and to determine compliance with this chapter.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified section
14-8-8 by changing “utilities department” to “water department”
14-8-9 Backflow permit required
A.   Installation: Unless included as a component of a building permit for new
construction, a separate backflow permit shall be obtained from the water
department for the installation of each backflow prevention assembly required
by this chapter, including a replacement assembly.
B.   Notification: The person performing work authorized by a backflow permit
shall notify the water department at least 24 hours before the work is ready to
be inspected.
C.   Permit suspension or revocation: The water department may suspend or
revoke a permit issued in error or in violation of any applicable ordinance or
regulation.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified section
14-8-9 by changing three instances of “utilities department” to “water
department”
14-8-10 Test; maintenance; records
A.   The customer shall test and service backflow prevention assemblies at
least once a year. If the testing reveals that the assembly is defective, the
customer shall repair, replace, or overhaul the assembly to satisfactory
operating condition.
B.   If the water department or a customer learns or discovers between tests
that an assembly is defective, the customer shall repair, replace, or overhaul
the assembly to satisfactory operating condition.
C.   The annual testing shall be performed by an individual certified by an
entity approved by the water department to test backflow prevention assemblies.
The water department will maintain and make available upon request a list of
individuals certified to test backflow prevention assemblies.
D.   The customer shall maintain records of all test results and all servicing,
repairs, overhauls or replacements of the backflow prevention assembly. The
records shall be maintained on forms approved by the water department. A copy
of the records shall be promptly submitted to the water department after
completion of the activity for which the record is made.
E.   Fire systems shall not be out of service for more than eight consecutive
hours due to testing, maintenance, or repairs. The local fire department shall
be notified immediately of any changes in fire service status.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified section
14-8-10 by changing four instances of “utilities department” to “water
department”
14-8-11 Modification of backflow prevention requirements
Ordinance 2015.015 modified section
14-8-11 by changing “utilities department” to “water department”
The water department may modify the requirements of section
14-8-5 if both of the following apply:
A.   Inspection of the customer’s system indicates that a backflow prevention
method less restrictive than required in section
14-8-5 will provide adequate protection of the public potable water supply from
the degree of hazard potential by the customer’s water system.
B.   The less restrictive method is supported by industry best management
practices.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified section
14-8-12 by changing two instances of “utilities department” to “water
department”
14-8-12 Discontinuance of water service
A.   If a required backflow prevention method is not installed or has been
bypassed or removed, or an unprotected cross-connection exists in the
customer’s water system, the water service to that service connection shall be
disconnected. The water department shall take reasonable steps to notify the
customer before, and if unable to do so, after the disconnection. The service
shall not be restored until the condition is corrected.
B.   If a required backflow prevention method is not properly tested or
maintained, the water department shall issue a notice to the customer requiring
the condition to be corrected within the time specified in the notice, which
shall be not less than seven days. If not corrected within the time specified
in the notice, water service shall be disconnected. The service shall not be
restored until the condition is corrected.
C.   Water service to a fire sprinkler system shall not be disconnected unless
a cross-connection exists and presents an imminent threat to the public potable
water supply.
14-8-13 Fees
The fee for any permit required pursuant to the terms of this chapter shall be
established by a fee schedule adopted by the council and amended from time to
time.
14-8-14 Violation
It shall be a civil offense, punishable by a $250 fine, for any person to
violate any of the requirements of this chapter. Each day a violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense.

an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these sources are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing facility, and the extent to which the new
facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing
source, should be considered.
      b.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the
criteria of subparagraph
14-10-5 A. 31. a. ii or iii above but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to
existing process or production equipment.
      c.   Construction of a new source as defined under this paragraph has

the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW; or,
         iv.   Has a potential for adversely affecting the POTW’s operation or
for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement (in accordance with 40
CFR § 403.8(f)(6).
      b.   The director may determine that an industrial user subject to
categorical pretreatment standards under § 403.6 and 40 CFR Chapter I,
subchapter N is a non-significant categorical industrial user rather than a
significant industrial user on a finding that the industrial user never
discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical wastewater
(excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater unless
specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the following
conditions are met:
         i.   The industrial user, prior to the director’s finding, has

wastewater.
      c.   Upon finding that a user meeting the criteria in subparagraph a ii
of this definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the
POTW’s operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the
director may at any time, on the director’s own initiative or in response to a
petition received from an industrial user, and in accordance with the
procedures in 40 CFR § 403.8(f)(6), determine that such user should not be
considered a significant industrial user.

noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
      a.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined
in 40 CFR § 403.3(l).
      b.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all of the measurements for the same pollutant parameter
during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits as defined
in 40 CFR § 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS,
and FOG, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
      c.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 CFR § 403.3(l) (daily maximum, longer-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard) that the director determines has caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public).
      d.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare or the environment or has resulted in the director’s
exercise of emergency authority under section
14-10-21 below to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      e.   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance.
      f.   Failure to provide, within 45 days after due date, required reports
such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.
      g.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
      h.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the director determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
   49.   Slug load: Any industrial wastewater discharged at a volume or
concentration that will cause interference or upset of the POTW; any sample,
the concentration of which exceeds five times the allowable discharge
limitation; or any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, including, but
not limited to, an accidental spill or a non-customary batch discharge.
   50.   Solid waste: any garbage, or refuse, sludge from a wastewater
treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control
facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semi-solid, or
contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and
agricultural operations, and from community activities, but does not include
solid or dissolved materials in domestic sewage, or solid or dissolved
materials in irrigation return flows or industrial discharges that are point
sources subject to permit under 33 U.S.C. § 1342, or source, special nuclear,
or by-product material as defined by the atomic energy act of 1954, as amended
(68 Stat. 923).

(b) of the CWA.
   54.   Upset: An exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and
temporary noncompliance with discharge limits because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, and lack of preventive maintenance or careless
or improper operation.
   55.   User: An industrial user or a significant industrial user.
   56.   Wastewater: The liquid and water-carried industrial or domestic waste
from dwellings, commercial establishment, industrial facilities, and
institutions, together with any groundwater, surface water, and storm water

14-10-6 Regulated wastes—general prohibitions
A.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any sewer that
directly or indirectly connects to the POTW, any waste which:
   1.   may have an adverse or harmful effect on the POTW, POTW personnel or
equipment, POTW effluent quality, or public or private property;
   2.   may otherwise endanger the public, the environment or create a public
nuisance;
   3.   exceeds limitations as set by this chapter or the director;
   4.   causes the POTW to violate state or federal regulations or permits.
B.   These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not
they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national,
state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
C.   Prohibited wastes described in this chapter shall not be discharged to the
POTW. Included within the prohibition is the discharge of any wastes that
adversely affect water reclamation, water reuse, sludge disposal, or air
quality.
D.   The director, in determining the acceptability of specific wastes, shall
consider the nature of the waste and the adequacy and nature of the collection,
treatment and disposal system available to accept the waste.
E.   The director may establish discharge limitations for industrial users that
have a reasonable potential to degrade wastewater quality to the level that it
prevents or inhibits the POTW’s efforts to reclaim the water, for sludge
disposal, or causes any unusual operation or maintenance problems in the POTW.
F.   The director may grant a variance from this chapter for any technological
standard as outlined in section
14-10-9 below.
G.   The current water quality standards for phenolics, codified at AAC R18-11-
101 through 304, are suspended, pending further administrative rule making
proceedings by the director of ADEQ, and shall not be enforced against any user
pursuant to A.R.S. title 49. Until such further administrative rule making
proceedings are concluded, no person shall discharge phenol compounds to
surface waters at levels or in combinations sufficient to be toxic to humans or
local animal, plant or aquatic life. Phenol (total) is an indicator and, in and
of itself, is not a violation unless there is a corresponding violation of the
appendix A numeric water quality standards for surface waters table 1, water
quality criteria by designated use, found in AAC R18-11.
14-10-7 Prohibited wastes
Except as provided elsewhere in this Article, prohibited wastes shall include:
A.   Industrial wastewater that may be adverse or harmful to the POTW, the
sewerage conveyance system, POTW personnel, POTW equipment, or POTW effluent
quality, including, but not limited to:
   1.   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, solvent, fuel oil or any other liquids,
solids, or gases which may create or tend to create a fire or explosion hazard
in the POTW, or may be injurious in any other way to the POTW, including, but
not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140° F
using the test method specified in 40 CFR § 261.21;
   2.   Any solids or viscous substances of such size or in such quantities

substances, which may cause excessive foaming in the sewerage system;
   13.   Any sludge from a water or wastewater treatment plant not owned or
operated by the town. The director may issue an industrial wastewater discharge
permit for a user to discharge this substance upon a finding that the discharge
will not adversely affect the operation of the POTW and that the pollutant
concentrations do not exceed those in the sludge produced by the POTW. No such
permit shall be issued that would violate any other federal, state or local
rule, regulation or standards;
   14.   Any hazardous wastes discharged to any portion of the POTW by truck,

would less adequately provide for the protection of the POTW. The variance
shall secure substantially the objectives of the portion of the Ordinance to
which the variance is granted. Variances may be allowed when:
   1.   A substitution for or change in a standard material results in the use
of a material which can be clearly demonstrated to be of equal or superior
quality;
   2.   A strict adherence to a design standard or standard details would be
impractical or impossible because of field conditions such as existing utility
facilities or incompatible existing sewerage facilities; or
   3.   An emergency situation prohibits strict adherence to a design standard
or standard detail.
14-10-10 Additional discharge limits
A.   Quantitative or other limitations intended for application to general
users and not for inclusion only on individual permits, shall be proposed to
the council by the director after a public hearing. The director shall provide
notification at least 45 days prior to the public hearing by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the town and by a written notice to any
person who has filed a request for notification with the director. The notice
shall contain a brief description of the nature of the proposal to be
considered, the time and place of the hearings, and the projected date that a
proposal shall be made to the council for approval of discharge limits.
B.   When the director determines that a user is discharging to the POTW any
waste not previously identified as prohibited in such amounts as may interfere,
pass through, or upset the operation of the POTW, the director shall: (1)
advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; (2) develop a
discharge limitation for such user to correct the interference with the POTW;
and (3) require the user to comply with the discharge limits.
14-10-11 Health care related wastes

within 30 business days of receipt of a completed permit application.
      e.   During the substantive review time frame, the director may make one
comprehensive written or electronic request for additional information.
      f.   The substantive review time frame and overall time frame are
suspended from the date the request is issued until the date that the county
receives the additional information from the applicant.
      g.   The total overall timeframe for the permit application process shall
be 45 business days not counting time response time by the applicant.
      h.   By mutual written or electronic agreement, the director and an
applicant for a permit may extend the substantive review time frame and the
overall time frame. An extension of the substantive review time frame and the
overall time frame may not exceed 25% of the overall time frame.
   6.   All users shall reply to the director and submit any permit application

by filing a request with the town clerk.
14-10-14 Industrial wastewater discharge permit fees
Fees in amounts set forth in the comprehensive fee schedule shall be paid to
the town upon application for, or renewal or modification of, all wastewater
discharge permits.
14-10-15 General requirements
A.   State and federal requirements. All users shall comply with all applicable
federal rules, regulations or pretreatment standards, or any applicable more
stringent state or local rules, regulations or standards, whether or not
contained in a permit.
B.   Separation of wastes. All domestic wastewater from restrooms, showers,
drinking fountains, and similar sources shall be kept separate from all
industrial wastewaters until the industrial wastewaters have passed through any
required pretreatment facility or device and the industrial wastewater
monitoring facility. The director may waive this condition if the combined
wastewater formula at paragraph
14-10-15 E is utilized.
C.   Sample location. As a condition of the permit, all discharged industrial
wastewater shall pass through a designated sampling location where the director
has unrestricted physical access.
D.   Accidental discharge protection (spill protection and slug discharge
control). Each user shall provide and maintain, at the user’s expense,
protection from the accidental discharge or spill into the POTW of prohibited,
hazardous or other waste materials which are regulated through this chapter. No
user shall commence discharge to the POTW without accidental discharge
protection facilities or procedures. The user shall notify the POTW immediately
of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge.
E.   Combined wastewater formula.
   1.   The combined wastewater formula will be used by users that mix
regulated wastewaters with other regulated or unregulated wastewaters prior to
pretreatment. The alternative concentration limits shall be derived using the
formula found in 40 CFR § 403.6(e):
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/9ffc88f83a30c72464a3145985ee9bf8383501f8/
IMAGES/0-0-0-44.png]
Where:
      CT = the alternative concentration limit for the combined wastestream.
      Ci = the Categorical Pretreatment Standard concentration limit for a
pollutant in the regulated stream i.
      Fi = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) of stream i to
the extent that it is regulated for such pollutant.
      FD = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) from: (a) boiler
blowdown streams, noncontact cooling streams, stormwater streams, and
demineralizer backwash streams; provided, however, that where such streams
contain a significant amount of a pollutant, and the combination of such
streams, prior to pretreatment, with an industrial user’s regulated process
wastestream(s) will result in a substantial reduction of that pollutant, the
control authority, upon application of the industrial user, may exercise its
discretion to determine whether such stream(s) should be classified as diluted
or unregulated. In its application to the control authority, the industrial
user must provide engineering, production, sampling and analysis and such other
information so that the control authority can make its determination; or (b)
sanitary wastestreams where such are not regulated by a categorical
pretreatment standard; or (c) from any process wastestreams which were or could
have been entirely exempted from categorical pretreatment Standards pursuant to
paragraph 8 of the NRDC v. Costle (568 F.2d 1369 (DC Cir. 1977)) consent decree
for one or more of the following reasons: (1) the pollutants of concern are not
detectable in the effluent from the industrial user; (2) the pollutants of
concern are present only in trace amounts and are neither causing or likely to
cause toxic effects; (3) the pollutants of concern are present in amount too
small to be effectively reduced by technologies known; or, (4) the wastestreams
contain only pollutants which are compatible with the POTW.
      FT = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) through the
combined treatment facility (includes Fi and FD and unregulated streams).
      N = the total number of regulated streams.
   2.   An alternative discharge limit may not be used if the alternative limit
is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants. As
a result, the combined wastewater formula cannot be used, and wastestreams must
be segregated.
F.   Duty to reapply. The user shall submit a new application with the
appropriate fee 90 days before the existing permit expires.
G.   Duty to comply.
   1.   The user must comply with all conditions of the permit. Any permit
noncompliance constitutes a violation of this chapter and is grounds for
enforcement action.
   2.   The user shall comply with effluent standards or prohibitions
established under § 307(a) of the clean water act for toxic pollutants within
the time provided in the regulations that establish these standards or
prohibitions.
H.   Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense
for a user in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt
or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the
conditions of the permit.
I.   Duty to mitigate. The user shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or
prevent any discharge in violation of the permit which has a reasonable
likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment.
J.   Proper operation and maintenance. The user shall at all times properly
operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control (and
related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the user to achieve
compliance with the conditions of a permit or this chapter. Proper operation
and maintenance also include adequate laboratory controls and appropriate
quality assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of back-up
or auxiliary facilities or similar systems which are installed by a user only
when the operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of
the permit.
K.   Duty to provide information. The user shall furnish within 30 days, any
information the director may request to determine whether cause exists for
modifying, revoking and reissuing, or to determine compliance with the permit.
The user shall also furnish to the director upon request, copies of records
required to be kept by the permit.
L.   Inspection and entry.
   1.   Upon the town’s compliance with A.R.S. § 9-833, the user shall allow
the director to:
      a.   Enter upon the user’s premises, at reasonable times, where a
regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records must
be kept under conditions of the permit.
      b.   Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must
be kept under conditions of the permit.
      c.   Inspect, at reasonable times, any facilities, equipment (including
monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or
required under the permit.
      d.   Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purposes of assuring
permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by this chapter, any substances or
parameters at any location.
      e.   The user has the right to a split or duplicate of any samples taken
during the inspection if the split or duplicate of any samples, where
appropriate, would not prohibit an analysis from being conducted or render an
analysis inconclusive.
   2.   The director shall have the right to set up on the user’s property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user’s operations.
   3.   The director may require the User to install monitoring equipment as
necessary.
      a.   The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense.
      b.   All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated based on manufacturer recommendation to ensure their accuracy.
   4.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user’s
premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   5.   Where a user has security measures in place which require proper
identification and clearance before entry onto its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security group so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the director shall be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing inspections and monitoring.
M.   Monitoring and records.
   1.   Samples and measurements taken for the purpose of monitoring shall be
representative of the permitted activity.
   2.   The user shall retain records of all monitoring information, including
all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip chart recordings
for continuous monitoring instrumentation, documentation associated with best
management practices (BMPs), copies of all reports required by the permit, and
records of all data used to complete the application for the permit, for a
period of at least three years from the date of the sample, measurement, report
or application. This period may be extended by request of the director at any
time.
   3.   Records of monitoring information shall include all of the following:
      a.   The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements.
      b.   The individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements.
      c.   The date(s) analyses were performed.
      d.   Laboratory(ies) which performed the analyses.
      e.   The analytical techniques or methods used.
      f.   Chain of custody forms.
      g.   Any comments, case narrative or summary of results produced by the
laboratory. These comments should identify and discuss QA/QC analyses performed
concurrently during sample analyses and should specify whether analyses met
project requirements and 40 CFR 136. The summary of results must include
information on initial and continuing calibration, surrogate analyses, blanks,
duplicates, laboratory control samples, matrix spike and matrix spike duplicate
results, sample receipt conditions, holding times and preservation.
      h.   The results of such analyses.
   4.   Collection, preservation and analysis of compliance samples must be
conducted according to test procedures approved by 40 CFR § 136 as adopted in
AAC R18-9-A905(A)(7), unless other test procedures have been specified in the
permit.
      a.   Except as indicated in subparagraphs b and c below and unless time-
proportional composite or grab sampling is approved by the director (sampling
must be representative of the discharge), the user must collect wastewater
samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques.
      b.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, sulfides, and
volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
Samples collected may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, and sulfides, the sample may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organic compounds and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory.
      c.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports in 40 CFR § 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
director may authorize a lower minimum. For reports required by 40 CFR § 403.12
(e) and (h), the user is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   5.   All compliance samples shall be analyzed by an environmental laboratory
licensed in conformance with Arizona revised statutes title 36, chapter 4.3,
article 1 (A.R.S. § 36-495 through -495.16).
N.   Compliance schedule. The director shall require the development of a
compliance schedule by users for the installation of technology required to
meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements. When a new
requirement is placed upon a user, a compliance schedule may be established to
allow the user to come into compliance.
O.   Signatory requirement. All applications, reports, or information submitted
to the director shall be signed and certified by a person meeting the
requirements of subparagraph
14-10-13 A. 5 above or by an authorized representative.
P.   Re-opener clause. A permit shall be modified to incorporate an applicable
standard or limitation promulgated or approved after the permit is issued if
that standard or limitation is more stringent than the limitation in the
permit, or controls a pollutant not limited in the permit.
Q.   Minor modification of permit. The director may modify a permit to make
corrections or allowances for changes in the permitted activity listed in this
paragraph. Any permit modification not processed as a minor modification under
this paragraph must be made for cause. Minor modifications may only:
   1.   Correct typographical errors;
   2.   Change an interim compliance date in a schedule of compliance, provided
the new date is not more than 120 days after the date specified in the existing
permit and does not interfere with attainment of the final compliance date
requirement;
   3.   Allow for a change in ownership or operational control of a facility
(after notice to the director) where the director determines that no other
change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing
a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability
between the current and new user has been submitted to the director; or,
   4.   Implement the compliance schedule for a user which is a new source. No
such change shall affect a user’s obligation prior to discharge.
R.   Major modification or termination of permit. The director may modify or
terminate a permit for cause. The following are causes for modifying or
terminating a permit during its term, or for denying a permit renewal
application:
   1.   Significant noncompliance (as defined in paragraph
14-10-5 A. 48 above) by the user with any condition of the permit;
   2.   The user’s failure in the application or during the permit issuance
process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or the user’s misrepresentation
of any relevant facts at any time;
   3.   A determination that the permitted activity endangers human health or
the environment and can only be regulated to acceptable levels by modification
or revocation; or,
   4.   A change in any condition that requires either a temporary or a
permanent reduction or elimination of any discharge controlled by the permit.
S.   Availability of reports. Except for data determined to be confidential by
40 CFR § 2.201 subpart B, all reports prepared in accordance with the terms of
the permit shall be available for public inspection at the water department
after director approval. Permit applications, permits, and effluent data shall
not be considered confidential. Environmental audit reports prepared in
accordance with A.R.S. § 49-1401 et seq. shall be held as confidential and not
disclosed as provided for in A.R.S. § 49-1404.
T.   Removed substances. Regulated wastes or other pollutants removed in the
course of treatment or control of wastewaters shall be properly disposed of in
a manner such as to prevent any pollutant from such materials from entering the
POTW.
U.   Severability of permit conditions. The provisions of the permit are
severable, and if any provision of the permit, or the application of any
provision of the permit to any circumstance, is held invalid, the application
of such provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of the permit,
shall not be affected thereby.
V.   Civil and criminal liability. Except as provided in permit conditions on
by-pass and upset, nothing in the permit shall be construed to relieve the user
from civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance.
W.   Permit actions. The permit may be modified, suspended or revoked for
cause. The filing of a request by the user for a permit modification,
reissuance, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance
does not stay any permit condition.
X.   Property rights. The permit does not convey any property rights of any
sort, or any exclusive privilege.
Y.   Comment period. The permit holder has 33 days from the date the permit is
mailed to the permit holder to comment in writing to the director.
Z.   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not
to exceed five years.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified paragraph S by changing “utilities department” to
“water department”
14-10-16 Notification requirements
A.   Notification of accidental discharge, spill, slug loading, bypass, upset
or other noncompliance.
   1.   Notification of bypass, upset, accidental discharge, spill, or slug
load.
      a.   In the event of bypass, upset, accidental discharge, spill, or slug
load that may endanger health, the environment, or the POTW, the user shall
notify the water department by telephone immediately upon discovery of the
occurrence.
      b.   The user shall notify the water department by telephone within 24
hours after the user becomes aware of that any discharge exceeds any effluent
limitation in the permit, or exceeds a maximum discharge limitation for any of
the pollutants listed in this chapter.
      c.   The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
discharge concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken by the user.
      d.   Within five days following initial notification, the user shall
submit to the director a detailed written report containing such information
and describing the cause of the discharge and measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. This notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, fines, civil penalties or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW or any other person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other
applicable law.
      e.   The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming
aware of the exceedance.
   2.   Other noncompliance notification. The user shall report all instances
of noncompliance at the time monitoring reports are submitted. The reports
shall contain the information listed in subparagraphs 14-10-16 A. 1. c and d
above.
   3.   Other information. Immediately upon discovery, the user shall promptly
submit facts or information it failed to submit or incorrectly submitted in a
permit application or in any report to the director.
B.   Bypass.
   1.   Bypass not exceeding limitations: The user may allow any bypass to
occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it
is also for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provisions of subparagraphs 14-10-16 B. 3 and 4 below.
   2.   Notice
      a.   Anticipated bypass: If the user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass.
      b.   Unanticipated bypass: The user shall submit notice of an
unanticipated bypass as required in paragraph
14-10-16 A. 1 above.
   3.   Prohibition of bypass: Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take
enforcement action against a user for bypass, unless:
      a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage. Severe property damage means substantial physical
damage to property, damage to treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can be
reasonably expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage
does not mean economic loss by delays in production;
      b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities or retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and,
      c.   The user submitted notices as required under subparagraph
14-10-16 B. 2 above.
   4.   Anticipated bypass. The director may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in subparagraph
14-10-16 B. 3 above.
C.   Upset.
   1.   Effect of an upset: An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with such technology-based permit effluent
limitations if the requirements of subparagraph
14-10-16 C. 2 below are met.
   2.   Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset: A user who wishes to
establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly
signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
      a.   An upset occurred and that the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      b.   The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;
      c.   The user submitted notice of the upset as required in paragraph A. 1
of this section; and,
      d.   The user properly operated and maintained all facilities and systems
of treatment and control as required under paragraph
14-10-15 J above.
   3.   Burden of proof: In any enforcement proceeding, the user, seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset, has the burden of proof.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified subparagraphs a and b by changing “utilities
department” to “water department”
14-10-17 Reporting requirements
A.   Planned changes. The user shall give notice to the director as soon as
possible of any planned physical alterations or additions to the permitted
facility in one of the following circumstances:
   1.   The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the
criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source.
   2.   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in
the discharge from the regulated process.
      a.   The report shall state whether the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met and, if not, what
additional operations and maintenance or pretreatment is necessary.
      b.   This statement shall be reviewed by an authorized representative of
the user and certified.
   3.   Any anticipated facility expansions, production increases, or process
modifications which will result in new, different, or increased discharges of
pollutants must be reported by submission of a new permit application or, if
such changes will not violate the discharge limitations specified in the
permit, by notice to the water department.
      a.   Following such notice, the permit may be modified to specify and
limit any pollutants not previously limited or change existing limits or other
requirements.
      b.   Approval must be obtained prior to any new discharges.
      c.   The user shall allow 45 business days for review.
B.   Anticipated noncompliance. The user shall give advance notice to the
director of any planned changes in the permitted facility or activity which may
result in noncompliance with permit requirements.
C.   Transfers. Permits are not transferable to any person except after notice
to the director. The director may require modification or reissuance of the
permit to change the name of the user and incorporate such other requirements
as may be necessary under this chapter.
D.   Monitoring reports. Monitoring results shall be reported at the intervals
specified in the permit.
   1.   Monitoring results must be reported on a self-monitoring report form
(SMRF), or a form approved by the director to the extent that the information
reported may be entered on the form for the report period.
   2.   If the user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
permit, using test procedures approved under 40 CFR § 136 or as specified in
the permit, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the calculation
and reporting of the data submitted in the SMRF.
   3.   Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of
measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified by the
director in the permit.
   4.   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user must
submit documentation required by the director or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
E.   Reduced periodic reporting. The director may reduce the requirement for
periodic compliance reports to a requirement to report no less frequently than
once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by
the EPA or the state, where the industrial user’s total categorical wastewater
flow does not exceed 5,000 gallons per day.
   1.   Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the
last two years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in paragraph
14-10-5 A. 48 above.
   2.   Reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user with daily
flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly
that, in the opinion of the director, decreasing the reporting requirement for
this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
F.   Compliance schedules. Reports of compliance or noncompliance with, or any
progress reports on, interim and final requirements contained in any compliance
schedule of the permit shall be submitted no later than 14 days following each
scheduled date.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified paragraph 3 by changing “utilities department” to
“water department”
14-10-18 Issuance of notification of violation
A.   Notification of violation. Whenever the director finds that a user is in
violation of this chapter, any part of a permit, or any order for corrective
action, the director shall serve or cause to be served upon such user, a
written notification of violation describing the nature of the alleged
violation. The notification of violation may include, but is not limited to:
   1.   An order for corrective action;
   2.   A schedule to attain compliance;
   3.   An order to show cause why the matter should not be referred to the
town’s legal department for appropriate legal action;
   4.   An order to cease discharge;
   5.   A suspension or revocation of the user’s permit; or
   6.   An order to respond in writing to the allegations.
B.   Additional orders after notification of violation. Additional orders and
changes to a suspension or revocation may follow the initial order at the
discretion of the director or as additional information becomes available.
C.   Response to notification of violation.
   1.   The user shall respond in writing to the director within the time
specified in the notification of violation, or if not specified, within ten
days of the user’s receipt of the notification.
   2.   The user’s response shall be complete, containing all information and
data required by the notification of violation.
   3.   If the response to a notification of violation requires an order to
show cause, the user shall respond by demonstrating why the director should not
ask the town’s legal department to file an action in superior court requesting
injunctive relief and penalties.
D.   Resolution of notification of violation. Upon review of a response to a
notification of violation, the director may accept the response as complete and
satisfactory, and consider the notification of violation closed. In that event,
the Director shall notify the user in writing that the notification of
violation has been closed. Closure of a notification of violation does not
preclude further enforcement action.
E.   Deficient response to notification of violation. If the director
determines a response to a notification of violation is deficient, the director
may take any one or more of the following actions:
   1.   Require submission of additional or incomplete information;
   2.   Suspend or revoke the user’s permit;
   3.   Order the user to cease discharge;
   4.   Seek penalties as justified by the violations; or
   5.   Any other action the director determines to be appropriate.

compliance schedule may be made part of an enforcement order. The deadline
dates in the enforcement order will be subject to the same civil penalties and
will be as enforceable as a discharge limit.
G.   Published list of significant violators. To comply with the public
participation requirements of 40 CFR Part 25 as outlined in A.R.S. § 49-391(C)
for the enforcement of national pretreatment standards, the director shall at
least annually publish notification, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice in the town, of industrial users in
significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time
during the previous 12 months. For purposes of this provision, a significant
industrial user (or any industrial user that violates 40 CFR § 403.8 paragraphs
(f)(2)(viii)(C), (D), or (H)) is in significant noncompliance if its violation
meets the definition of significant noncompliance set forth in paragraph
14-10-5 A. 48 above.
14-10-19 Notification of permit suspension
A.   Reason for permit suspension. The director shall use the emergency
authority specified below as reason to suspend a permit when:
   1.   The suspension is necessary to cease a discharge that may present a

B.   Transfer of facility ownership. Individual wastewater discharge permits
shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business
ownership.
C.   User response to permit revocation. Any user whose permit has been revoked
shall immediately cease all discharge of any industrial wastewater to the POTW.
D.   Failure to comply with permit revocation. If the user fails to comply
voluntarily with the notification of permit revocation, the director shall take
such steps as necessary to ensure compliance up to and including termination of
service by court order or physical barrier.
E.   Resolution of permit revocation. Before re-commencing discharge of
industrial wastewater, the user whose permit was revoked must apply for and
obtain a new industrial wastewater discharge permit, pay all charges that would
be required upon initial application, and pay all delinquent fees, charges and
such other sums the user may owe to the town. Before the director issues a new
permit, the user shall pay damages and costs incurred by the town in revoking
the permit and disconnecting the industrial sewer.
14-10-21 Emergency termination of service
A.   The director may suspend wastewater treatment service to any person when
it is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may
present any imminent and substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or the environment, or will cause Interference to the POTW.

14-10-30 Grease management program
A.   Statement of policy.
Ordinance 2015.015 modified subparagraph A 1 by changing “utilities department”
to “water department”
   1.   The water department is authorized to determine the compliance status
of food service facilities (FSF) where fats, oils and grease (FOG) of vegetable
or animal origin are discharged directly or indirectly to the POTW. These
discharges can contribute to line blockages or sanitary sewer overflows.
   2.   For the purpose of this chapter and pretreatment requirement
determination, FSFs are defined as those facilities required by applicable
state or local health regulations to install and utilize a manual ware-washing
three compartment sink.
   3.   The purpose of these rules is to set forth uniform requirements for all
food service facilities that discharge into any public or private collection
system connected to the POTW.
      a.   Any new FSF or existing facility making a modification requiring the
submittal of plans for construction or tenant improvements must meet the
requirements of the grease management program set forth in this section.
      b.   Facilities without pretreatment, or whose grease-bearing
wastestreams are not connected to a pretreatment device, must upgrade their
system to the requirements of the grease management program set forth in this
section or obtain an industrial wastewater discharge permit.
   4.   An existing facility that was built in conformance with standards in
the then-applicable plumbing code need not bring current its pretreatment
system unless the director finds that the facility caused or contributed to
grease accumulation in the line or odor generated by grease accumulation.
B.   Operation and maintenance of pretreatment devices.
   1.   All pretreatment devices shall be maintained in efficient operation at
all times by the owner or operator at their expense.
   2.   Food service facilities are required to have a suitable and adequate
pretreatment device, and must regularly inspect, clean and maintain the device
in accordance with the grease management program set forth in this section or
in the manufacturer’s recommendations for the device.
   3.   In maintaining pretreatment devices, the owner/ shall be responsible
for the proper removal and disposal of the captured material and shall maintain
records of the dates, name of person/company, and the amount of material
removed.
   4.   Pretreatment device maintenance performed by liquid waste haulers shall
consist of removing the FOG, solids and water from the device and properly
disposing of the material in accordance with all federal, state and local laws.
Proper maintenance practices include evacuating the entire contents in the
following manner:
      a.   Remove floatable FOG material;
      b.   Remove settled solids;
      c.   Remove and scrape baffles, baffle slots, interior walls and other
detachable components;
      d.   Remove remaining FOG, solid material and water (“pump-in-full”—no
“skimming”); and
      e.   Reinstall all components removed during the cleaning process.
   5.   Under no circumstances shall any liquid removed from any pretreatment
device be placed back into any pretreatment device.
C.   Hydromechanical and gravity grease interceptor and other alternative
pretreatment device design criteria. Pretreatment devices shall be designed and
installed in accordance with the sizing criteria found in this paragraph. A
sampling port/box/T, which will accommodate the collection of a valid oil and
grease sample, shall be included on all pretreatment device installations.
   1.   Hydromechanical grease interceptors (HGI), which are generally
installed inside, may be used when there are four or fewer fixtures.
      a.   The minimum size HGI installed shall be rated no less than 25
gallons per minute with a 50 pound grease retention capacity.
      b.   A flow control device shall be installed so that the flow through
the device shall at no time be greater than the rated flow.
      c.   If a dishwasher or food waste disposal unit is used in the facility,
an HGI cannot be used and an appropriately sized GGI or alternative
pretreatment device capable of accepting these wastes must be installed.
      d.   Each HGI must be cleaned at least monthly.
      e.   An HGI located indoors should be cleaned during non-business hours
to prevent objectionable odors/germs from being released into the facility.
   2.   A gravity grease interceptor (GGI) is typically installed outside and
in the ground when a FSF has greater than four fixtures, or when dishwasher or
food waste disposal units are used in the facility.
      a.   The minimum sized GGI to be installed shall be 300 gallons.
      b.   A GGI shall be installed so that it is easily accessible for
inspection, cleaning and the removal of FOG and solid material.
      c.    A GGI shall meet the following minimum criteria:
         i.   No obstruction to prevent the proper access and cleaning of the
GGI.
         ii.   Access covers located such that the influent and effluent
sanitary “T” and compartment transition points (if applicable) are accessible
for proper cleaning and inspection.
         iii.   An access cover for each chamber and constructed with the
appropriate traffic rating.
      d.   The GGI must be pumped-in-full at least every six months or when the
total accumulation of surface FOG (including floating solids) and settled
solids reaches 25% of the GGI’s overall depth.
      e.   The GGI shall be sized to meet the following equation: V(min) = F x
R x S
         Where:
            V(min)=minimum gravity grease interceptor operating volume, in
gallons
            F=flow rate (maximum), in gallons per minute
            R=retention time of 30 minutes
            S=storage factor of 25%
            Thus: V(min) = F x 30 x 1.25
      f.   To calculate flow rate (F), use drainage fixture units (DFU) values
found in the accompanying GGI fixture counts tables. The flow rate shall be
determined based on the total flow rate from all equipment and plumbing
fixtures connected to the gravity grease interceptor using one of the following
equations:
         i.   Drainage Fixture Units less than or equal to 40: F = (0.8 x DFU)
         ii.   Drainage Fixture Units greater than 40: F = (0.3 x DFU) + 20
            a)   Where: DFU = drainage fixture units, defined by the
accompanying GGI fixture counts tables.

CHAPTER 14-11.
NON-POTABLE WATER SERVICE WITHIN CORTARO-MARANA IRRIGATION DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
Ordinance 2022.012 added chapter 14-11
14-11-1 Background
The use of non-potable water for landscaping reduces demands on the potable
water system and, where operated using water supplies not otherwise available
to the town's water department, maximizes renewable resources in the town's
water resource portfolio. The long-term best interests of the town and its
residents, businesses, and water utility require evaluation and consideration
of the use of non-potable water for each proposed project where non-potable
water facilities are available or can reasonably be made available.
14-11-2 Applicability and definitions
A.   Geographic limitation; CMID defined. The requirements of this chapter
apply only within the district boundaries of the Cortaro-Marana Irrigation
District (CMID).
B.   Proposed project defined. For purposes of this chapter, the term "proposed
project" means a proposed public project or a proposed industrial, commercial,
or residential development, including all proposed, planned, or required
landscaping, park, and/or recreational features of the proposed public project
or proposed industrial, commercial or residential development.
C.   CMID waiver. The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to any
proposed project where CMID, in its sole discretion, has provided the applicant
or the town with a signed, written waiver stating that CMID is unable to

17-2-3 Planning department and planning manager
A.   Pursuant to A.R.S. §9-461.03, the planning department of the town of
Marana is hereby established, and here and after referred to as the development
services department. The development services department shall perform the
planning functions for the town and shall provide technical support and
guidance for action on all plan and ordinance amendments and on applications
for development approval and shall perform such other functions as may be
requested by the town council or the planning commission as authorized by this
code.
B.   Pursuant to A.R.S. §9-462.05(C), the position of planning manager is
hereby established. The planning manager is the person designated by the town
manager as being primarily responsible for the administration of this title,
regardless of that person’s job title. The planning manager is the “zoning
administrator” for purposes of title 9, article 6.1, A.R.S. (A.R.S. § 9-462 et
seq.)
Ordinance 2021.004 replaced section 17-2-3 (planning director) with section 17-
2-3 (planning department and planning manager)
A.R.S. § 9-462.05 (C) requires the council to establish the office of zoning
administrator, who is responsible for enforcement of the zoning ordinance.
A.R.S. § 9-462 (A)(4), defines the “zoning administrator” as the official
responsible for enforcement of the zoning ordinance. In Marana, the planning
manager is the zoning administrator.
Ordinance 2021.004 deleted section 17-2-4 (cultural resources preservation
board)

department.
   2.   An owner of real property within the town, or that owner's authorized
representative, may apply for a rezoning of that property by filing a written
application with the development services department.
B.   Rezoning. The town has three broad rezoning categories:
   1.   Translational or non-site analysis rezoning: A simplified rezoning with
flexible application requirements for any rezoning that does not require a site
analysis as described in subparagraph 2 below.
   2.   Site analysis rezoning: A rezoning used in all of the following
circumstances:
      a.   When property is to be developed for more than one non-residential
use or on multiple lots.
      b.   When property is to be developed with more than three lots for
single- family residential use.
      c.   When property is to be developed for multi-family residential use.
   3.   Specific plan: A specific plan, as defined in section
17-1-6(A), contains unique development and design standards specific to a
rezoning site on a parcel of five acres or more, with either single-or multi-
phased development. See section
17-4-15 for further requirements regarding specific plans.
C.   Citizen review process. After submission of an application for a rezoning
to the town and before the planning commission holds a public hearing on the
matter, the applicant and the town shall comply with the citizen review process
set forth in this paragraph.
   1.   The applicant shall mail written notice of the application to all
owners of property located within 300 feet of the subject property and to any
other persons reasonably determined by the planning manager to be potentially
affected citizens. All distances shall be measured from the property lines of
the subject property.
      a.   The written notice shall provide a general explanation of the
substance of the proposed rezoning, and shall provide notice of the date, time,
and location of a neighborhood meeting to discuss the application.
      b.   The applicant shall mail the written notice by first class mail at
least 15 days prior to the neighborhood meeting.
   2.   The applicant shall hold the neighborhood meeting, noticed as provided
in subparagraph 1, a minimum of 15 days prior to the planning commission public
hearing.
   3.   Following the neighborhood meeting, the applicant shall submit to the
planning manager a meeting summary that includes:
      a.   Copies of the written notice required by subparagraph 1 and of the
mailing list for the notice.
      b.   A list of the people in attendance at the meeting.
      c.   A description of the issues that were raised and a summary of the
discussion.
   4.   The town shall post a sign on the subject property at least 15 days
prior to the planning commission public hearing. The town will ensure that the
sign complies with design standards specified by the town and is placed in a
conspicuous location. The town will incorporate the costs associated with the
sign posting into the town’s fees for rezoning applications, as set forth in
the comprehensive fee schedule approved by the council and amended from time to
time.
   5.   The planning manager may authorize an alternative citizen review
process for translational, non-site analysis rezoning applications, and other
similar rezoning applications deemed appropriate for the alternative process by
the planning manager, as long as the alternative process meets the requirements
of A.R.S. § 9-462.03.
D.   Procedures.
   1.   Before any application for a text amendment or rezoning is accepted by
the development services department, the applicant shall submit an application
for a pre-application meeting. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to
discuss, in general, the procedures and requirements for an amendment request
pursuant to this section.
   2.   All applications shall follow the requirements defined in the town's
applications, checklists, and process guides on file with the development
services department. The planning manager may waive the requirement to provide
any information required by an application, checklist, or process guide by
making a written finding specifying the reasons the information is not needed
for a thorough review of the proposed amendment or rezoning. The waiver shall
be included in the materials submitted to the planning commission and the
council.
   3.   The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the application
and shall recommend to the town council approval, approval with conditions, or
denial of the rezoning or text change. Prior to the public hearing, public
notice shall be given in the manner provided in A.R.S. § 9-462.04 (A).
   4.   After the public hearing before the planning commission, the planning
manager shall schedule the application for hearing before the town council.
   5.   The town council shall hold a public hearing on the application and
shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the rezoning or text change.
Prior to the public hearing, public notice shall be given in the manner
provided in A.R.S. § 9-462.04(A).
   6.   When a rezoning application is accompanied by an application for a
conditional use permit applications may be processed and reviewed concurrently.
   7.   If the proposed rezoning is inconsistent with the land use designation
in the general plan, an application for an amendment to the general plan shall
be submitted by the applicant in accordance with the requirements of the
general plan. Amendments to both the official zoning map and the general plan
may be considered concurrently.
E.   Approval criteria. The planning commission and town council shall consider
the following, at a minimum, in reviewing an application for a rezoning:
   1.   Any change of character in the area due to installation of public
facilities, other zone changes, new growth trends, deterioration, and
development;
   2.   The degree to which the proposed zoning will benefit the community;
whether there will be benefits derived by the community, or area, by granting
the proposed rezoning;
   3.   Whether the proposed rezoning is compatible with the surrounding area
or whether there will be adverse impacts on the capacity or safety of the
portion of street network influenced by the rezoning, parking problems, or
environmental impacts that the new use will generate such an excessive storm
runoff, water, air, or noise pollution, excessive nighttime lighting, or other
nuisances;
   4.   Whether the proposal conforms with and is in furtherance of the
implementation of the goals and policies of the general plan, other adopted
plans, and the goals, objectives and policies of this land development code,
and other town regulations and guidelines, including goals and policies
relating to economic development;
   5.   The zoning districts and existing land uses of the surrounding
properties;
   6.   Whether the existing and proposed transportation infrastructure is
suitable and adequate to serve the traffic anticipated to be generated by the
proposed development.
   7.   Whether the existing and proposed utility infrastructure, public
facilities, and public services are suitable and adequate to serve the proposed
rezoning area;
   8.   Whether the subject property is suitable for the uses to which it has
been restricted under the existing zoning classification;
   9.   Whether the rezoning is compatible with the adjacent neighborhood,
especially residential neighborhood stability and character;
   10.   If applicable, the length of time the subject property has remained
vacant as zoned; and,
   11.   Whether there is an adequate supply of land available in the subject
area and the surrounding community to accommodate the zoning and community
needs.
F.   Review time frames. The town shall review all zoning applications pursuant
to the following time frames.
   1.   The town shall determine whether a zoning application is
administratively complete within 30 days after receiving the application.
   2.   If the town determines that a zoning application is not
administratively complete, the town will provide the applicant with a written
notice that includes a comprehensive list of the specific deficiencies. Upon
issuance of the written notice, the administrative completeness review time
frame and overall time frame contained in this section are suspended until the
town receives the resubmitted application.
   3.   The town shall determine whether a resubmitted application is
administratively complete within 15 days after receiving the resubmitted
application. If the town determines that a resubmitted application is not
administratively complete, the process set forth in subparagraph F.2 above
shall repeat until the application is administratively complete.
   4.   After determining that a zoning application is administratively
complete, the town council shall approve or deny the application within 180
days. The town may extend the time frame to approve or deny a zoning
application beyond 180 days for either of the following reasons:
      a.   Town staff may grant a one-time extension of not more than 30 days
for extenuating circumstances; or
      b.   Town staff may grant extensions in 30-day increments at the request
of the applicant.
   5.   This section does not apply to zoning applications for any of the
following:
      a.   Land that is designated as a district of historical significance
pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-462.01(a).
      b.   An area that is designated as historic on the national register of
historic places.
      c.   Land that is already zoned as a specific plan.
Ordinance 2021.010 replaced Section 17-3-1 in its entirety; Ordinance 2022.006
amended Section 17-3-1B. and D.
Ordinance 2023.005 adds provisions relating to a citizen review process for
rezoning applications.
Ordinance 2024.027 added paragraph F. to Section 17-3-1.
17-3-2 Conditional use permits
A.   Purpose. The town recognizes certain uses which may be appropriate in a
specific zoning district, but which may have characteristics that, depending
upon the location, design, and standards of operation, may have a greater
impact than permitted uses on nearby properties, businesses, or residences.
Such uses require more comprehensive review, including the ability of the town
to establish specific conditions for the project to mitigate any potential
impacts. The planning commission can evaluate only conditional uses listed, and
is empowered to grant, grant with conditions, or deny any application for a use
permit. The planning commission’s review is subject to findings and the
application meeting requirements of this section. The burden of proof shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
B.   Application. Applications shall be filed with the planning manager on an
application form with the required documentation specified on guidelines
provided by the planning manager with appropriate fees. The application, at a
minimum, shall include the following:
   1.   Name and address of the applicant. If the applicant is not the owner of
the property, the name and address of the owner shall be supplied along with
authorization that the applicant is the agent of the owner and may apply for
the use permit. Proof of ownership must be submitted with the application.
   2.   A statement describing the proposed use, and any pertinent data
required to evaluate the use, including but not limited to: hours of operation,
numbers of employees and shifts, processes and materials involved in the use,
and types and volume of traffic generated by the use.
   3.   A site plan including dimensions showing the type and location of
buildings, structures, floor plans, parking, landscaping, circulation and other
relevant site information.
   4.   Any additional information required by the planning manager.
C.   Public hearing. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the
application. Prior to the public hearing, notice shall be sent to all owners of
property located within 300 feet of the property subject to the request and
shall be given in the manner provided in A.R.S. § 9-462.04 (A).
D.   Findings. A conditional use permit may be granted only after a
determination by the planning commission that the proposed use:
   1.   Will not adversely affect the orderly development and improvement of
surrounding property for uses permitted within the zoning district;
   2.   Will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of the property in the
immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially
diminish or impair the property values within the neighborhood;
   3.   Will not adversely affect the tax base and other substantial revenue
sources within the town;
   4.   Conforms to the character of the neighborhood, within the same zoning
district, in which it is located, giving consideration to the location, type,
and height of the buildings or structures and the type and extent of
landscaping and screening on the site;
   5.   Is on a proposed site adequate in size and shape to accommodate the
intended use and all requirements for the zone district will be met, including
but not limited to, the setbacks, walls, landscaping and bufferyards;
   6.   Will have ingress and egress designed to minimize traffic hazards and
to minimize traffic congestion on the public roads;
   7.   Is consistent with the general plan and other adopted town plans;
   8.   Shall not be noxious or offensive by reason of vibration, noise, odor,
dust, smoke, or gas;
   9.   Will have adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, fire protection,
and other necessary facilities; and
   10.   Benefits the public interest and welfare to an extent sufficient to
outweigh the individual interests adversely affected by the establishment of
the proposed use.
E.   Action by the planning commission. The planning commission may grant,
grant with conditions, or deny the application. If the application is denied,
the planning commission shall make factual findings on the public record with
the reasons for the denial. The planning commission may place any conditions
which are deemed necessary to mitigate potential impacts and insure
compatibility of the use with surrounding development and the town as a whole.
These conditions may include, but are not limited to:
   1.   Requirements for setbacks, open spaces, buffers, fences or walls to
mitigate conflicts from visual, noise, lighting and similar impacts associated
with the use;
   2.   Dedication and/or paving of street or other public rights-of-ways, and
control in location of access points and on-site circulation to mitigate
traffic impacts from increased volumes or nature of traffic activity associated
with the use;
   3.   Regulations pertaining to hours of operation, methods of operation, and
phasing of the development of the site to mitigate impacts to surrounding
properties and the neighborhood;
   4.   Time limits on the duration of the permit to determine if the use,
after a temporary period of operation, is materially detrimental or to evaluate
whether changed conditions in the neighborhood effect the capability of the use
to continue to adequately mitigate impacts to the surrounding area or the town
as a whole.
F.   Effective date of the conditional use permit. The decision of the planning
commission shall be final and effective 15 days from the date of decision
unless an appeal is filed as provided below.
G.   Appeal procedure.
   1.   The action of the planning commission may be appealed to the council by
the applicant, any member of the council, the town manager or any property
owner within 300 feet of the property subject to the request. Such requests for
appeal must be filed on an application form provided by the planning manager,
with the appropriate fee, within the 15 days following the date of the planning
commission action.
   2.   Consideration of the appeal shall be made at a public hearing.
   3.   Notice of the hearing shall be placed in the newspaper of general
circulation in the area designated by the council for legal public notice at
least 15 days prior to the hearing.
   4.   The council shall act to affirm, or reverse, in whole or in part, or
modify the planning commission’s decision including adding to or deleting the
conditions attached to the approval by the planning commission. Any action to
grant a conditional use permit, either by affirmation, modification, or
reversal of the planning commission’s decision, must include the required
findings for use permits as provided in this section.
H.   Modification of conditional use permits. A request to modify, expand, or
otherwise change an approved conditional use permit, not in substantial
conformance with the approved permit, shall be processed according to the
provisions of this section as a new application.
I.   Exercise and use. A permit automatically expires if the use is not
established within six months of its grant or within the time otherwise
specified in the permit, whichever is greater. For a use requiring a building
permit, the use is established when a building permit is issued or a
development plan is approved for the use. If the use does not require a
building permit, the use is established when the planning manager finds clear
and visible evidence of the use’s establishment.
J.   Extension of initial period for use. Upon a showing of good cause, the
planning manager may extend the period for initially exercising the permit for
a maximum of one additional year.
K.   Expiration upon discontinuance. If a use established under a conditional
use permit is discontinued for any reason for a period of six months, the
permit becomes void and the use may not be resumed. Upon applications during
the six month period by the owner and upon showing of good cause, the planning
manager may grant another extension not to exceed a total of six additional
months.
L.   Revocation. Failure to comply with the conditions, stipulations or terms
of the approval of a conditional use permit is a violation of this code.
Repeated offenses shall be cause for revocation of the permit.
M.   Grounds for revocation. The planning commission may revoke a permit on any
of the following grounds:
   1.   Violation of a zoning regulation of the town.
   2.   Violation of a term, limitation or condition of the conditional use
permit.
   3.   Causing or allowing a nuisance in connection with the premises.
   4.   Conviction of a violation of federal or state law or town ordinance in
connection with the operation of the permitted use.
N.   Termination upon change of use. A conditional permit for an established
use terminates upon the establishment of a new use.
O.   Status of the conditional use permit. A use permit granted pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall run with the land and continue to be valid
regardless of ownership of the property or structure so long as it operates
within the conditions, stipulations, and terms of the permit.
P.   Conditional uses upon annexation
   1.   Purpose. The uses and densities permitted under county zoning and in
county zoning districts do not directly correlate to the uses and densities
permitted in the most closely comparable town of Marana zoning classifications.
Upon annexation, this paragraph P is intended to authorize the council to
conditionally permit uses and densities permitted by the county immediately
before annexation upon translation of county zoning to the most closely
comparable town of Marana zoning classification.
   2.   Applicability. The special procedures and authority set forth in this
paragraph P apply only to the translation of county zoning to town of Marana
zoning upon annexation of property.
   3.   Procedure. Except as specifically set forth below, paragraphs A
(purpose) through G (appeal procedure) and I (exercise and use) through K
(expiration upon discontinuance) of this section 17-3-2 shall not apply to
conditional uses authorized upon annexation pursuant to this paragraph P.
Conditional uses granted upon annexation shall be included in the ordinance
adopted by council translating county zoning upon annexation.
   4.   Findings. In determining whether to grant conditional uses upon
annexation pursuant to this paragraph P, the council shall consider the factors
set forth in paragraph D (findings) of this section.
   5.   Conditions. Conditional uses permitted by the council upon annexation
may include conditions the council deems necessary to mitigate potential
impacts and insure compatibility of the use with surrounding development and
the town as a whole, including without limitation those conditions set forth in
paragraph E of this section.
   6.   Effect. Paragraphs H (modification of conditional use permits), L
(revocation), M (grounds for revocation), and O (status of the conditional use
permit) shall apply to conditional uses permitted by the council upon
annexation pursuant to this paragraph P.
Ordinance 2021.003 amended paragraphs A, C, E, J, L, O, P.3, P.4, and P.6;
replaced paragraphs B.3, B.4, and D.1 through D.10; and restructured paragraphs

A.   The zones and zoning groups listed in
table 1 (zone districts and zoning groups summary) are established by this
section.
B.   
Table 1 also shows the consolidation of certain residential zoning districts
into zoning groups as of the effective date of this chapter. These zoning
groups combine zones that allow the same uses in the use matrix table (
table 2) and the conditions per use table (
table 3). In some cases, a zoning group label is used for ease of reference in
table headings and cross-references (for example, "ER" in place of "R-36").
C.   Official zone map. The location and boundaries of each of the zones are
shown on the official zone map of the town, and the map is a part of this code.
Whenever amendments or changes are made in zone boundaries, the amendments or
changes must be made by ordinance and recorded on the official zone map. The
official zone map data layer maintained by and located in the office of the
technology services department is the final authority in determining current
zoning status.
D.   Zone districts and zoning groups summary table. The following table shows
the town's zone districts and zoning groups.

17-4-2 Use matrix
A.   
Table 2 (use matrix) identifies the permissiveness of uses in all residential
zoning groups and zoning districts other than the mixed-use districts and the
SP zone. (Uses for the mixed-use districts are set forth in the mixed-use
zoning district use matrix found at
table 8.)
B.   The notations in
table 2 have the following meanings:
   1.   "P" means the use is permitted subject to design standards.
   2.   "A" means the use is permitted as an accessory use located on the same
lot with a permitted use.
   3.   "C" means the use is allowed upon approval of a conditional use permit
(see section
17-3-2).
   4.   "U" means the use is allowed upon meeting the conditions set forth in
table 3 below.
   5.   "T" means the use is allowed upon approval of a temporary use permit
(see section
17-3-3).
   6.   "X" means the use is prohibited.
C.   Uses not mentioned.
   1.   General presumption. Uses not listed shall be presumed to be
prohibited, unless the planning manager determines that the use is materially
similar to a listed use.
   2.   Planning manager determination. If a use is not listed in
table 2 and is not otherwise prohibited by law, the planning manager shall
determine whether the use is materially similar to a use listed in
table 2, using as a guide the type of business, industry, or governmental
activity as classified and defined by the two-digit sector number of the most
recently published north American industry classification system (NAICS) as
established by the United States census bureau.
   3.   Materially similar uses. If the planning manager finds that the use is
materially similar, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the use
not listed and the planning manager's decision shall be filed in the office of
the town clerk.
   4.   Not materially similar uses. If the planning manager determines that a
materially similar use does not exist, the planning manager may consider
submitting an amendment to this section to establish a specific listing for the
use in question by legislative action of the town council upon recommendation
by the planning commission.

3 residential zones consist primarily of single-family homes, with one dwelling
and accessory buildings on an individual lot.
B.   The following development standards apply in the R-180, R-144, R-80, R-36,
R-16, R-10, R-8, R-7, R-6, R-5, R-4, and R-3 zones:
   1.   Minimum lot sizes for each zone are determined by the number following
the dash multiplied by one thousand square feet. For example, the minimum lot
size of the R-180 zoning district is 180,000 square feet.
   2.   Properties are regulated based on their primary use as set forth in the
use matrix set forth in section

   3.   Only one primary use is permitted.
   4.   No accessory buildings may be located within the minimum front setback.
   5.   Lot widths and depths.
      a.   Each lot must have a width-to-depth ratio of between 3.0 and 0.33.
Therefore, the average depth of the lot must be at least one-third its average
width, and the average width of the lot must be at least one-third its average
depth.
      b.   When the ratio set forth in the preceding paragraph provides a lot
width or depth less than the minimum lot widths and depths set forth in

17-4-9 Mixed-use zoning districts
A.   General. The mixed-use zoning districts are the BU, DO, DT, and DN zones.
Properties in mixed-use zoning districts are regulated primarily on the
physical form, intensity, character, and size of buildings and uses. Use
restrictions in the mixed-use zoning districts are found in the use matrix set
forth in
table 8 below.
B.   Purpose. The mixed-use zoning districts promote walkable, compact,
downtown and neighborhood development. The zones will vary the intensity of
land use, variety of land uses, scale and size of buildings, and other factors
according to the context.
   1.   The BU zone is implemented through a blended-use plan, approved with
the rezoning to BU, comprised of a combination of the three intensities
described below and regulated by section
17-4-11.
      a.   Low intensity. Consists of single-family residential areas, with
some mix of uses, home occupations, and accessory buildings.
      b.   Medium intensity. Consists of a mix of uses but is primarily blended
density residential. It contains a wide range of building types-houses,
courtyard housing, townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, small apartment buildings,
and live-work units.
      c.   High intensity. Consists of higher density mixed-use buildings that
accommodate retail, offices, institutions, and apartments or condominiums.
   2.   The DT and DN zones are implemented through a downtown implementation
plan, submitted by one or more owners of land located in the DO district. Until
submission and approval of a downtown implementation plan, the underlying
zoning entitlements remain in place. Upon town approval of a downtown
implementation plan, the underlying zoning entitlements are replaced with the
zoning entitlements set forth in the DT and DN zones.
C.   Use. Mixed-use districts are subject to the requirements of
table 8 below, where the notations have the following meanings:
   1.   "P" means the use is permitted subject to design standards.
   2.   "A" means the use is permitted as an accessory use located on the same
lot with a permitted use.
   3.   "C" means the use is allowed upon approval of a conditional use permit
(see section
17-3-2).
   4.   "U" means the use is allowed upon meeting the conditions set forth in
table 9 below.
   5.   "T" means the use is allowed upon approval of a temporary use permit
(see section
17-3-3).
   6.   "X" means the use is prohibited.
D.   Uses not mentioned.
   1.   General presumption. Uses not listed in
Table 8 and not otherwise prohibited by law shall be presumed to be permitted
subject to the conditions and restrictions that apply to the most similar use,
as determined by the planning manager. A use shall be prohibited only if the
planning manager determines that the use is not similar to any listed use.
   2.   Planning manager determination. In making the determination required by
paragraph
17-4-9 D. 1 above, the planning manager shall use as a guide the most recently
published north American industry classification system as established by the
United States census bureau.
   3.   Notice of determination. The planning manager's determination under
paragraph
17-4-9 D. 1 above shall be filed in the office of the town clerk, with copies
provided to the council and manager.
   4.   Ratification or modification. The planning manager's determination may
be ratified or modified by legislative action of the town council upon
recommendation by the planning commission.
   5.   No similar uses. If the planning manager determines that a similar use
does not exist, the planning manager may submit an amendment to this section to
establish a specific listing for the use in question by legislative action of
the town council upon recommendation by the planning commission.

E.   Civic space. The purpose of civic space is to ensure civic amenities are
appropriate in type and location. Civic space is required per the standards
below.
   1.   At least 5% of the net developable area of all blended-use plans and of
downtown implementation plans five acres or larger must be dedicated to civic
space.
   2.   Civic spaces are identified and located in the blended-use plan or
downtown implementation plan, and are permitted by location per
table 8 above.
   3.   Each blended-use plan or downtown implementation plan 40 acres or more
in area must have at least one green, square, or plaza (see 2, 3, or 4 of
table 10). The main civic space must be located within 800 feet of the
geographic center of the plan and may be adjusted up to 25% in length from the
center by the planning manager for topographical conditions, or existing street
alignment.

17-4-10 Mixed-use streets
The requirements of this section, rather than the town's subdivision street
standards manual, apply within the BU, DN, and DT zones.
A.   Centerlines of offset thoroughfares entering onto a collector or arterial
must be at least 300 feet apart.
B.   Streets must connect to other streets, forming a network. The planning
manager is authorized to permit a deviation to this requirement, thereby
allowing a dead-end street terminating in a cul-de-sac, consistent with the
following requirements:
   1.   The planning manager, in consultation with the town engineer, makes one
or more of the following determinations:
      a.   The physical terrain will make connection to other streets cost-
prohibitive or unsafe.
      b.   Existing development physically blocks connection to other streets.
      c.   Access restrictions or standard traffic engineering considerations
make connection impossible or unsafe.
   2.   Connectivity for bicycles and pedestrians should be created and
maintained whenever possible, even when there is no vehicular connectivity.
   3.   No cul-de-sac may exceed the greater of 300 feet to the center of the
bulb or one-half block in length.
C.   Block standards.
   1.   Blocks consist of lots surrounded by streets.
      a.   Lengths of block faces may not exceed the maximum length of a block
face, measured along lot lines, per
table 13, except the planning manager may increase the maximum length by up to
10% to accommodate specific site conditions.
 
Table 13. Maximum block face length
Zone or Intensity   Length in feet
BU low intensity    500
BU medium intensity 400
BU high intensity   300
DT                  300
DN                  400
 
      b.   Where two or more zones or intensities occur on the same block face,
the block face length may not exceed the shortest required length.
   2.   The planning manager may exempt blocks adjacent to undeveloped land,
areas unsuitable for development, or pre-existing incomplete blocks from a
limitation on block length.
   3.   Block faces exceeding 500 feet must be subdivided with a sidewalk
extending through the block that is 12 feet wide, minimum.
   4.   Rear alleys are required for medium and high intensity areas in the BU
zone and in DT and DN zones. Rear alleys are not mandatory where the rear lot
lines are at the edge of the site to be subdivided or where the block has been
previously subdivided.
D.   Intersection sight visibility distances are determined based on the
subdivision street standards, except that sight visibility zones are not
required for mixed-use zone intersections controlled by a traffic signal or
stop sign.
E.   Streets in mixed-use zones must be designed as follows:
   1.   Streets classified as arterials shall use the avenue street cross
section (
table 14, cross section 1)
   2.   Streets classified as collectors shall use the avenue or street cross
section (
table 14, cross section 1, 2, 3, or 4).
   3.   Streets classified as local roadways shall use the street cross section
(
table 14, cross section 2, 3, or 4).
   4.   As an alternative to the above, streets in the BU high intensity area
and in the DT zone may use the commercial street-mixed parking or parking plaza
street cross sections (
table 14, cross section 7 or 8).
   5.   The alley cross section (
table 14, cross section 5) may be used for secondary, service, or parking
access.

17-4-11 Blended-use (BU)
The blended-use zoning district may be applied by process of rezoning to any
parcel 40 acres or greater. The approval of rezoning to BU adopts the blended-
use plan submitted by the applicant in conformance with this section and
section
17-4-9 (Mixed-use zoning districts).
A.   Blended-use neighborhood types.
   1.   Aldea. This blended-use neighborhood type consists of no less than 40
acres and no more than 80 acres.
   2.   Pueblo. This blended-use neighborhood type has no less than 80 acres,
and no more than 200 acres.
B.   Multiple neighborhoods must be developed under a single application on
properties larger than 200 acres.
C.   Intensities. Aldeas and pueblos are comprised of land assigned to
intensities rather than uses. The minimum and maximum percentage of the
blended-use plan's total land area to be assigned to each intensity is given in
table 15 below.

17-4-11 was amended for clarity in the introductory paragraph by Ordinance 17-
4-11
17-4-12 Downtown Marana overlay (DO)
A.   Purpose. The DO is an overlay designation identifying geographic areas
where owners of land may opt to replace their underlying zoning entitlements
with the DN and DT zone designations.
B.   Application. To obtain DN and DT zoning in the DO district, one or more
property owners must submit a downtown implementation plan, showing (at a
minimum) the requested locations of DN and DT zone designations on their
property.
C.   Administrative approval. The planning manager is authorized and directed
to approve a downtown implementation plan that conforms to the requirements of
sections
17-4-9 (Mixed-use zoning districts),
17-4-12 (Downtown Marana overlay (DO)),
17-4-13 (Downtown neighborhood (DN)), and
17-4-14 (Downtown (DT)), and meets the following minimum requirements:
   1.   The DT designation includes all land within 100 feet of the Marana Main
Street right-of-way line.
   2.   The DN designation includes all land within 100 feet of the property
line of all properties containing existing single-family residences, excluding
any such property for which the property owner consents in writing.
   3.   The DN designation must be used for land that meets both of the
previous two paragraphs.
D.   Council approval. Any downtown implementation plan not approved pursuant
to paragraph C of this section may be submitted as an application for rezoning,
which shall be reviewed through the normal rezoning process.
Ordinance 2024.010 amended paragraph C, removed paragraphs D and E, and
renumbered paragraph F
17-4-13 Downtown neighborhood (DN)
A.   Purpose. The DN zone implements the Marana general plan by providing a
transition from the DT to surrounding areas. This zone consists of a mix of
uses but is primarily medium density residential. It may contain a wide range
of building types: houses, courtyard housing, townhouses, duplexes, triplexes,
apartment buildings, and live-work units.
B.   Development standards.

A.   Purpose. The DT zone implements the Marana general plan by providing a
mixed-use center for town. This zone consists of higher density mixed-use
buildings that accommodate retail, offices, institutions, and apartments. It
has a network of walkable streets that create blocks along Marana Main Street
with wide sidewalks, street trees, awnings or galleries for shade, and
buildings set close to the sidewalks.

17-4-15 Specific plan (SP)
A.   General. Properties in each specific plan (SP) zoning district are
regulated based on site-specific regulations prepared by or on behalf of the
master property owner of the particular specific plan area. Each specific plan
is adopted through the rezoning process set forth in section
17-3-1.
B.   Applicability. The owner or owners of one or more contiguous parcels of
land totaling five acres or larger in size may apply for a specific plan.
C.   Contents of specific plan. All specific plans shall include the
requirements defined in the town's applications, checklists, and process guides
on file with the development services department. At a minimum, a specific plan
shall include the following elements:
   1.   Narrative or overview of the project which identifies the primary
objectives.
   2.   Development capability inventory analysis.
   3.   Proposed land use plan.
   4.   Implementation and administrative regulations.
   5.   Development and design regulations.
   6.   The compatibility of the specific plan with adjoining land uses.
   7.   Detailed regulations and programs for the systematic implementation of
the specific plan.
   8.   Specific development standards for the map elements.
   9.   Hydrology analysis.
   10.   Standards for the phasing, construction and maintenance of major and
collector streets proposed for the plan area or needed for servicing the
project.
   11.   Standards for the phasing, construction and maintenance of sewage
disposal, effluent use, storm water drainage, solid waste disposal and public
utilities.
   12.   Standards for the conservation, development or utilization of natural
resources, including surface water, soils, vegetation and wildlife.
   13.   General landscape program.
   14.   For single-phase plans, a draft schedule for the preservation of site
features established by the plan and the construction, dedication and provision
of public services.
   15.   For multi-phased plans, a draft phasing schedule for the preservation
of site features established by the plan, the development of the various master
blocks of the specific plan, and the construction, dedication and provision of
public services.
   16.   How and to what extent the specific plan is to supplement or supersede
the adopted land development code.
D.   Specific plan amendments. Amendments to specific plans are categorized as
either administrative amendments or substantial amendments. Administrative
amendments are approved by the planning manager after written application is
made. Substantial amendments are approved through the rezoning process set
forth in section
17-3-1.
   1.   The planning manager shall determine whether a proposed specific plan
amendment is administrative or substantial.
   2.   Categories of administrative amendments include, but are not limited
to:
      a.   The addition of new information to the specific plan maps or text
that does not change the effect of any regulations or guidelines.
      b.   Changes to infrastructure, such as drainage and utilities, which do
not change the overall intent of the specific plan or increase the development
capacity in the specific plan area.
      c.   Changes in the land use designation boundary, division of plan areas
or combinations of areas.
      d.   Minor modifications or adjustments to intrusions, encroachments,
easements, rights-of-way, or open spaces, so long as the modifications do not
conflict with the overall intent of the specific plan.
      e.   The addition of a use that is materially similar to a listed use, as
determined by the planning manager pursuant to the process set forth in section
17-4-2(C).
   3.   A substantial amendment is an amendment that would result in a
substantial change to the specific plan's regulations or the overall intent of
the specific plan, and that is not an amendment listed in subparagraph 2 above
or a materially similar amendment.
17-4-16 Legacy zones
A.   The zoning districts set forth in sections
17-4-17 through
17-4-26 below are legacy zones. The legacy zones consist of zoning districts
that currently exist within the town limits, but that are intended to be phased
out over time. Each of these zoning designations is intended to be deleted when
no land in the town has that zoning designation. The town will not rezone land
to any of these legacy zone districts.
B.   Notwithstanding any language in sections
17-4-17 through
17-4-26 permitting commercial and industrial uses in the legacy zones, as
provided in section
17-6-13, data centers are not permitted to operate in the town as a principal
use unless approved in a specific plan or specific plan amendment explicitly
created or amended for the purpose of data center development and adopted
through the rezoning process set forth in section
17-3-1 and as described in section
17-4-15 (Specific plan (SP)).
C.   Data centers are permitted as an accessory use in the legacy zoning
districts when all of the following are true:
   1.   The data center occupies no more than 15% of the site.
   2.   The data center is used to serve the enterprise functions of the on-
site property owner and is not used to lease data storage and processing
services to third parties. For purposes of this subparagraph "on-site property
owner" includes an owner that owns the property and is the parent company of
the company or companies on-site.
   3.   The data center complies with any applicable development standards for
accessory use data centers, as set forth in section
17-6-13.
Ordinance 2024.029 added paragraphs B. and C. to section 17-4-16.
17-4-17 Zone A - small lot zone
A.   Permitted uses. Within zone A, residential, commercial, industrial, and
quasi-public land uses shall be permitted so long as each such land use is
conducted on a lot no larger than 2.5 acres. Agricultural uses, as listed in
section
17-4-2, table 2 (Use matrix), shall be permitted in zone A in the same
circumstances as they are permitted in the AG zone per section
17-4-2, table 2, and subject to the same conditions per use as in the AG zone
per section
17-4-3, table 3 (Conditions per use). Rezoning is not required to establish a
use permitted in the neighborhood commercial (NC) zone, within an existing
building or suite in a designated commercial area if the use can be
accommodated within the existing building or suite without requiring a new
retail commercial building permit. This is not, however, to be construed to
permit any land use that may be specifically prohibited within the town by this
or any other ordinance of the town or by state or federal law.
B.   Density requirements. There shall be no maximum density of land use per
se, except that density of land use on any parcel of land within zone A shall
be determined in part by prior density of land use and by setback requirements
defined in this and other titles of this code or as may be determined by other
applicable federal, state and local regulations.
C.   Setbacks.
   1.   The required front yard (setback) shall be a minimum of 20 feet.
   2.   The required side yard (setback) shall be a minimum of five feet, with
a street side yard (setback) having a minimum of ten feet.
   3.   The required rear yard (setback) shall be a minimum of 20 feet.
D.   Building heights. Buildings and structures erected in this zone shall have
a height not greater than 30 feet.
E.   Manufactured home. A manufactured home may be placed on any lot within
zone A provided the following conditions are met:
   1.   There is an existing manufactured home on the lots adjacent to the lots
in which the new manufactured home is to be placed. Adjacent, for the purposes
of this section, means on either side, and means directly across the street, if
one exists, and to the rear across an alley, if one exists.
   2.   Where the provisions of subparagraph 1 above do not exist, then a
manufactured home may be placed on a lot with the issuance of a conditional use
permit pursuant to the procedure set forth in section
17-3-2 (conditional use permits).
Ordinance 2022.006 amended Section 17-4-17 A.
17-4-18 Zone B - medium lot zone
A.   Permitted uses. Within zone B, any residential, commercial, industrial, or
quasi-public land use is permitted so long as each separate land use is
conducted on a lot larger than 2.5 acres but no larger than 25 acres.
Agricultural uses, as listed in section
17-4-2, table 2 (Use matrix), shall be permitted in zone B in the same
circumstances as they are permitted in the AG zone per section
17-4-2, table 2, and subject to the same conditions per use as in the AG zone
per section
17-4-3, table 3 (Conditions per use). This is not to be construed, however, to
permit any land use that may be expressly prohibited within the town by other
ordinances of the town, by other provisions of this code, or by state or
federal law.
B.   Density requirements. There shall be no maximum density of land use per se
in this zone, except as may be dictated by prior density of land use and by
setback requirements defined elsewhere in this code.
C.   Setbacks. The setback requirements for zone B shall be the same as for
zone A.
D.   Manufactured home. A manufactured home may be placed on any lot within
zone B provided the following conditions are met:
   1.   There is an existing manufactured home on the lots adjacent to the lots

assure the installation of required street, sewer, electric and water
utilities, drainage, flood control, landscaping, park facilities, and other
improvements as required meeting minimum standards of design and construction
established by this title and the subdivision street standards. The purpose of
the assurances shall be to guarantee that the improvements are installed in a
timely manner and paid for without cost to the town.
   1.   Financial forms of assurance, including cash, letter of credit,
performance bond, or other similar instruments, shall be submitted to the town
engineer in an amount equal to the sum of the cost of construction for all

private property shall grant to the town adequate property rights as determined
by the town engineer and town attorney to allow the town or the town's
contractor to complete the installation. Where, in the opinion of the council,
the subdivider has failed or neglected to install the required improvements or

individual subdivision lot or block for which required subdivision improvements
have not yet been installed, are permitted in lieu of financial forms of
assurance.

assurances in a form approved as to substance by the town engineer and approved
as to form by the town attorney, if the town manager and town engineer are
satisfied that the substitute assurances protect the town to an extent equal to
or greater than the original assurances.
   1.   Financial forms of assurance and third party trust forms of assurance
may be used as substitute subdivision assurances.
   2.   Permit hold forms of assurance prohibiting the issuance of any building
permits on any individual subdivision lot or block for which required
subdivision improvements have not yet been installed are permitted as
substitute forms of assurance at the discretion of the town engineer and town
manager when the town engineer and town manager find that the permit hold form
of assurance is an appropriate mechanism to guarantee that required
improvements are installed in a timely manner for the development in question.
C.   Before release of assurances of or guarantees for construction or of
improvements in existing or proposed public rights-of-way, the following listed
documents shall be submitted, where applicable, to the town:

Ordinance 2023.032 added Section
17-6-12
17-6-13 Data centers
A.   Data centers are not permitted to operate in the town as a principal use
unless approved in a specific plan or specific plan amendment explicitly
created or amended for the purpose of data center development and adopted
through the rezoning process set forth in section
17-3-1 and as described in section
17-4-15 (Specific plan (SP)). Subject to the requirements of this section
17-6-13, a specific plan may authorize data center development in a specific
geographic area or region of a larger specific plan area.
B.   In addition to the requirements of section
17-4-15(C), an application for a specific plan or a specific plan amendment for
the purpose of data center development shall include the following information:
   1.   The baseline noise study and noise contour exhibit required by
paragraph G below.
   2.   The intended source of electric power for the development and
documentation from the electric utility provider affirming sufficient power
exists to serve the site.
   3.   An assessment of future energy needs for the site.
   4.   An estimate of annual water consumption for the site.
   5.   The intended source of water for the development, and documentation
from the water provider affirming sufficient water resources exist to serve the
site.
   6.   An explanation regarding how the development complies with each of the
requirements of this section
17-6-13; or, if the applicant requests that the council waive a requirement or
requirements, an explanation as to why compliance with the requirement(s) is
not feasible.
C.   The minimum requirements of this section
17-6-13 shall apply to any data center operated as a principal use unless the
council waives a requirement or requirements during the specific plan rezoning
process. In addition to these minimum requirements, the town may impose
additional or more stringent site-specific requirements or regulations during
the specific plan rezoning process, provided that the site-specific
requirements or regulations are reasonably related to the impact of the
development.
D.   The minimum requirements of this section shall apply to any data center
operated as an accessory use only where indicated.
E.   The minimum requirements of this section that are based on the planned or
zoned property uses of adjacent properties shall be established based on the
planned or zoned uses at the time of the specific plan rezoning process.
F.   The provisions of this section are intended to supplement the requirements
of this code. If any provision of this section is found to be in conflict with
any other provision of this code, the provision that establishes the higher or
more restrictive standard shall prevail.
G.   Noise Attenuation. The developer of a data center to be operated as either
a principal or an accessory use must conduct a noise study performed by a
qualified third-party acoustic engineer to document baseline sound levels in
the area of the proposed data center and to produce a noise contour exhibit
depicting the anticipated noise levels to be generated by the data center.
   1.   For purposes of this section
17-6-13:
      a.   "dBA" means the sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a
sound level meter using the A weighted filter network. The A weighted filter
network is designed to simulate the response of the human ear. The A weighted
sound level is expressed by the symbol "dBA."
      b.   "Daytime" means 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on weekdays, and 9:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays observed by the town.
      c.   "Nighttime" means 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on weekdays, and 8:00 p.m.
to 9:00 a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays observed by the town.
   2.   Any noise which emanates from any operation, activity, or source on a
data center site, including, but not limited to, heating and cooling system(s),
shall not exceed the maximum permissible sound levels set forth in Table 2
(Maximum sound levels for data center operation) measured at the property line
of the property affected by the noise.
 
Table 2. Maximum sound levels for data center operation
Planned or zoned use of affected property Maximum dBA Daytime/Nighttime
Residential and mixed-use                 55/55
Agricultural                              60/55
Commercial                                65/60
Industrial                                72/65
 
   3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Table 2 above, any person performing
site construction work in compliance with section
11-5-4 (Construction noise; extended work permits) shall not be subject to the
maximum sound levels set forth in Table 2 above.
   4.   The data center must be designed and built to incorporate sound
mitigation methods sufficient to prevent the sound levels emanating from the
data center, as determined by a qualified third-party acoustic engineer, from
exceeding the maximum sound levels set forth in Table 2. Design specifications
for the required sound mitigation must be provided to the town before building
permit approval.
   5.   Before issuance of a certificate of occupancy or certificate of
completion, whichever occurs first, the data center operator must conduct a
post-construction noise study performed by a qualified third-party acoustic
engineer to document sound levels emanating from the data center measured at
the property line of the nearest property to the data center property that is
planned or zoned for residential land uses, or other noise sensitive use as
reasonably determined by the zoning administrator, during peak operation of the
data center mechanical equipment. The post-construction noise study must
demonstrate that sound levels do not exceed the maximum sound levels set forth
in Table 2. If sound levels exceed the maximum sound levels set forth in Table
2, the town will issue a temporary certificate of occupancy until the data
center operator demonstrates that the required sound mitigation is achieved. If
the data center operator is unable to demonstrate compliance with the sound
levels set forth in Table 2 before expiration of the temporary certificate of
occupancy, the town will not issue a permanent certificate of occupancy.
   6.   The data center operator must also conduct an additional noise study,
as measured at the property line of the nearest property to the data center
property that is planned or zoned for residential land uses, or other noise
sensitive use as reasonably determined by the zoning administrator, annually
during peak operation of the data center mechanical equipment for five years
after completion of the initial post-construction noise study and when
requested by the town thereafter. The data center operator must provide the
results of the noise study to the town within 30 days of the anniversary of the
date on which the certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion was
issued by the town. If sound levels exceed the maximum sound levels set forth
in Table 2, the data center operator shall take appropriate steps to achieve
the required sound mitigation.
H.   Water. The Marana water department will not provide potable water to a
data center (principal or accessory use) for its cooling system, humidity
control, and other similar operations. The developer must demonstrate an
alternate source of water for these operations.
I.   Site Design Standards. The site design standards in Table 3 (Site design
standards for data center development) apply to the development of land that
will accommodate data centers, as well as the placement of buildings on a given
site. The standards are intended to help minimize the physical, environmental,
and visual impacts of data centers on adjacent development.

A.   Purpose. This section is adopted to comply with state law requiring
municipalities with a population over 75,000 to allow accessory dwelling units
on a lot or parcel with zoning that allows a single-family dwelling.
   1.   These regulations are in addition to the town's residential building
codes, fire codes, public health and safety regulations, and other regulations
of general applicability.
   2.   To the extent any provision in this section conflicts with state law,
state law shall control.
B.   Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:
   1.   "Accessory dwelling unit" means a self-contained living unit that is on
the same lot or parcel as a single-family dwelling of greater square footage
than the accessory dwelling unit, that includes its own sleeping and sanitation
facilities, and that may include its own kitchen facilities.
   2.   "Gross floor area" means the interior habitable area of a single-family
dwelling or an accessory dwelling unit.
   3.   "Permitted use" means approved without requiring a public hearing,
variance, conditional use permit, special permit, or special exception, other
than a determination that a site plan conforms with applicable zoning
regulations.
   4.   "Restricted-affordable dwelling unit" means a dwelling unit that,
either through a deed restriction or a development agreement with the town,
shall be rented to households earning up to 80% of area median income.
   5.   "Short-term rental" means rental use in which the tenant holds a lease
of less than ninety days or that meets the definition of "vacation rental" or
"short-term-rental" in A.R.S. § 9-500.39.
C.   Accessory dwelling unit as a permitted use. If the town determines that
adequate public utility services are available and the application complies
with this title and the town's building codes, fire codes, and public health
and safety regulations, the following are permitted uses on any single-family
lot or parcel that contains a primary dwelling:
   1.   One attached accessory dwelling unit and one detached accessory
dwelling unit.
   2.   One additional detached accessory dwelling unit on a lot or parcel that
is one acre or more in size if at least one accessory dwelling unit on the lot
or parcel is a restricted-affordable dwelling unit.
D.   Development standards and requirements.
   1.   Size. An accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed the lesser of 75% of
the gross floor area of the existing single-family dwelling on the same parcel
or 1,000 square feet.
   2.   Setbacks. An accessory dwelling unit shall meet the setbacks for
accessory buildings in the applicable zoning district, except that the rear and
side setbacks for an accessory dwelling unit shall be a minimum of five feet.
   3.   Heights. An accessory dwelling unit shall meet the height limit for a
single-family dwelling within the applicable zoning district.
   4.   Lot coverage. Lots with one or more accessory dwelling units must meet
the lot coverage requirements of the applicable zoning district.
   5.   Short-term rental. An accessory dwelling unit may be used for short-
term rental only if and while the owner resides on the property that contains
the accessory dwelling unit.
   6.   Easements. An accessory dwelling unit may not be built on a current or
planned public utility easement unless the property owner receives written
consent from any utility that is currently using the public utility easement or
that may use the public utility easement in the future.
E.   Exceptions. The provisions of this section do not apply to any single-
family lot or parcel located on any of the following:
   1.   Tribal land.
   2.   Land in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military
facility as defined in A.R.S. § 28-8461.
   3.   Land in the vicinity of a federal aviation administration commercially
licensed airport.
   4.   Land in the vicinity of a general aviation airport.
   5.   Land in the vicinity of a public airport as defined in A.R.S. § 28-
8486.
F.   Appeals. If an application for a proposed accessory dwelling unit is
denied or deemed not to be a permitted use, the applicant may appeal the town's
decision to the board of adjustment.
G.   Effective date. This section becomes effective when the town's population
reaches 75,000 persons as determined by the United States census bureau or by
official acknowledgment by the town council or any other governmental body with
jurisdiction to determine the town's population.

typically share a single parking area that is located at the front or front and
side of the center.
B.   Purpose. These design and development standards promote high-quality,
attractive development compatible with the town's general plan principles and
policies.
C.   Intent. These standards are intended to:
   1.   Encourage consistency in the quality of multi-family, commercial, and
industrial development within the town;
   2.   Assure the fair and consistent application of the town's design
objectives for multi-family, commercial, and industrial projects; and

an existing development. Major renovation does not include routine maintenance
and repair of a structure or other feature within the development, such as roof
replacement or general repairs to a parking area or other non-structural site
feature.
17-8-2 Site layout and building orientation
A.   Intent. This section is intended to accomplish the following goals in
multi-family, commercial, and industrial developments.
   1.   To ensure that the organization of buildings helps to define primary
street frontages and development entrances; to establish a more compact,
pedestrian-friendly pattern of development.
   2.   To encourage a less engineered, more passive approach to the treatment
of washes, drainage basins, and other natural features.

to the development;
      b.   Frames and encloses a "main street" pedestrian and/or vehicle access
corridor within the development site;
      c.   Frames and encloses parking areas, public spaces, or other site
amenities on at least two sides; or
      d.   Frames and encloses outdoor dining or gathering spaces for
pedestrians between buildings.
   5.   Washes and natural features. Natural topography should be integrated
into the site design to the extent feasible.
      a.   Washes with significant quality vegetation or other significant
natural features must be incorporated into the overall design and layout of a
development as visual and functional amenities, rather than being piped and
placed underground.

The purpose of this chapter is to respect the character of the town's natural
environment by preserving natural habitat, scenic corridors, unique or
significant ridges, peaks, riparian areas, wildlife corridors, rock
outcroppings, and areas of significant vegetation.
17-11-2 Definitions
The following definitions apply to this chapter.
A.   Native plant plan: A plan that specifies the proposed treatment of
protected native plants being disturbed by development.
B.   Noxious or invasive species: Species not native to Marana and adversely
affecting species native to Marana. Noxious or invasive species include but are
not limited to desert broom, tamarisk, Mexican palo verde, buffelgrass, and
tree of heaven.
C.   NUOS: Natural undisturbed open space.
D.   Plant community: An area of vegetation dominated by one or more species
that creates an environment that is beneficial, unique, or valuable to the
desert ecosystem.
   1.   Climate, elevation, soil type and other factors ultimately determine
the limits and boundaries of particular plant communities.
   2.   Examples of a plant community dominated by one species are grassland
and creosote bush association, or a grove of trees, for example a mesquite
bosque.
   3.   These communities can form almost pure stands of single species.
   4.   Examples of co-dominant communities are Cottonwood-Willow and Palo
Verde - Saguaro associations.
E.   Ridges/peaks: Raised land formations that are a dominant feature in the
surrounding landscape or constitute a significant linking element, including
the following:
   1.   Any parcel, lot, or project site containing slopes of 15% or greater,
which are both longer than 50 feet when measured in any horizontal direction
and higher than seven and one-half feet when measured vertically.
   2.   Areas which exhibit slopes that fail to meet the aforementioned
standards but contain boulder collapse, boulder rolling, rockfalls, slope
collapse, and/or talus slopes shall also be considered significant and/or
unique and subject to the preservation standards described in section
17-11-3 below.
F.   Riparian area: Area adjacent to or occurring on or near a watercourse or
drainage feature containing a moderate to high density of healthy and diverse
species and habitats, including but not limited to any area within a
jurisdictional delineation established by the United States fish and wildlife
service.
G.   Rock outcropping: Land containing a diversity of rock groupings, structure
types, exposed bedrock, or any significant geomorphic formation of varying
dimension and texture.
H.   SRI: Site resource inventory; that is, a map and inventory of significant
features of a site, meeting the requirements of section 1711-3 and containing
the information required by the town's SRI check list.
I.   Unique significant vegetation: One or more specific plant communities,
unique plant occurrences, or unique individual specimens, any of which has
special value to the Sonoran desert ecosystem because of one or more of the
following:
   1.   Plant species are native to the area.
   2.   Plant species composition is typical for the area.
   3.   Plants are generally healthy and will survive for five or more years.
   4.   Plant density is unusually high for the conditions (soil, slope,
orientation, water availability).
   5.   An unusually large number of mature specimens of individual trees and/
or columnar cactus species are present.
   6.   Noxious or invasive species are few and not visually prominent.
   7.   Grading or clearing has not substantially altered the landscape in the
area.
J.   Unique plant: Any native tree, shrub or cacti with extraordinary
characteristics such as, but not limited to, age, size, shape, form, canopy
cover or aesthetic value. An example may be crested saguaros, a rare, massive,
ancient tree or specimen tree with an unusual shape.
K.   Unique plant occurrences: Areas of vegetation that exist in contrast to
the majority of the surrounding vegetative community due to either
microclimates or availability of water resources. Examples are stands of
ironwood trees and riparian areas.
L.   Wildlife corridor: Land area that provides a source of connectivity
between two or more isolated habitat islands in a region where habitat is
fragmented by urbanization that compromises natural animal movement. Wildlife
corridor designation is designed to increase the confluence of the natural
landscape and the degree of animal mobility. Any land identified as a wildlife
corridor must be suitable for wildlife movement and must include enough native
resources to sustain migrating animals.
17-11-3 Site resource inventory
A.   A site resource inventory (SRI) shall be prepared for any development on a
site that contains unique or significant ridges, peaks, riparian areas,
wildlife corridors, and significant vegetation. These areas shall be protected
and preserved unless the town determines that it is not possible to do so
without depriving the property owner of any economically viable use of the
property.
B.   The SRI shall guide the site design (site plan, rezoning, subdivision
plat, and/or development plan) and shall be used to determine compliance with
the native plant program.
C.   A SRI shall be submitted with the pre-application materials for rezoning,
preliminary plat and development plan submittals or one month before
development submittal.
D.   The SRI shall be based on an aerial photograph of the site that is no
older than two years from the date of submittal.
E.   Preservation of unique significant vegetation should emphasize contiguous
groups of natural areas and unique significant vegetation. Areas of unique
significant vegetation include, but are not limited to, other natural areas
protected by this code.
17-11-4 Riparian areas, wildlife corridors and areas of significant vegetation
The following information shall be required, as it may apply:
A.   The property owner shall provide the town with a complete SRI per the
requirements of section
17-11-3.
B.   Biological linkages between existing wildlife and riparian corridors shall
be maintained.
C.   The size and shape of riparian areas and wildlife corridor linkages shall
be:
   1.   Determined based on existing studies or the town-accepted
recommendations of a qualified biologist; and
   2.   Delineated in the SRI.
D.   A riparian area or wildlife corridor linkage may be protected and enhanced
by a buffer of natural open space, open space, or golf course. The combined
linkage and buffer shall be wide enough to accommodate the wildlife species
most sensitive to human encroachment and known to inhabit the riparian area or
to traverse the wildlife corridor.
E.   Riparian areas and wildlife linkages delineated in the SRI and slated for
protection shall remain undisturbed throughout the course of development and
shall be fenced-off during construction.
F.   Any grading of the riparian and wildlife corridors and linkages shall be
mitigated at 100% by re-vegetation with plantings chosen to match adjacent
undisturbed natural areas with a minimum of five years growth and irrigation
supplied for two years to ensure the plants become established. Plant materials
shall be introduced to closely match existing species in terms of size, massing
and quality, as approved by the planning manager.
17-11-5 Native plant protection
A.   Purpose. These regulations provide for the preservation, protection,
transplanting, and replacement of existing designated native plants including
cacti, succulents, trees, and shrubs through the establishment of comprehensive
procedures, requirements, and standards which protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
B.   Findings. The town has determined that:
   1.   Native vegetation within the town is a unique natural resource that
promotes tourism and contributes to the economic and aesthetic well-being of
the community.
   2.   Native vegetation, as an integral part of the Sonoran desert,
contributes to the high property values, high quality of life, and unique
lifestyle which the community enjoys.
   3.   Native vegetation is important in stabilizing desert soils and
providing food and protection for many types of desert wildlife.
   4.   Native vegetation is more drought tolerant, requires less maintenance,
and uses less water than other types of landscaping.
   5.   Native vegetation is a slow growing type of plant material that cannot
always be successfully relocated. A plant of like character cannot replace
certain specimen plants, because of their form, age or location.
C.   Native plant protection. No person shall destroy, mutilate, remove from
the premises or relocate to another place on the premises any cacti, indigenous
trees and/or shrubs which are four inches or greater in caliper measured at the
base, any plants listed in the endangered species act as threatened,
endangered, and category 1, 2 and 3 species, and any plants included in the
Marana protected native plant list, without first applying for and submitting a
native plant plan to the town. Native understory plants shall be maintained in
an existing stand of plants and preserved in place.
D.   Applicability. A native plant plan shall be required for all of the
following:
   1.   All new development.
   2.   Expansions of existing development.
      a.   If the expansion is less than 25% of the area of the lot or parcel,
the requirements of this chapter apply only to the proposed expansion area.
      b.   If the expansion is 25% or greater or if expansions after October 2,
2001, cumulatively result in a 25% or greater expansion in land area, floor
area, lot coverage, or vehicular use area, the requirements of this chapter
apply to the proposed expansion area and the remaining undeveloped site area.
E.   Exceptions. A native plant plan shall not be required for the following:
   1.   On sites for which a grading plan is not required or where the total
area covered by all grading permits is 14,000 square feet or less.
   2.   A project on a site that does not contain any plant on the town's
protected native plant list, demonstrated by the applicant through photographic
and/or on-site verification, subject to the planning department's
determination. Supporting photographic verification must be submitted to the
planning department for review and approval at the time of development
application.
   3.   Previously graded sites containing no significant native vegetation may
apply for a native plant plan exception. Supporting photographic verification
must be submitted to the planning department for review and approval at the
time of development application.
   4.   A project that maintains a minimum 30% of the project area as NUOS. The
perimeter boundary of the NUOS shall be described and depicted with bearings
and distances to assure that the set-aside area equals a minimum of 30% of the
project area.
F.   Professional expertise. Preparation of all elements of the native plant
plan and on-site monitoring shall be performed by one of the following plant
professionals:
   1.   A landscape architect registered in the state of Arizona.
   2.   An arborist certified by the international society of arboriculture.
   3.   A horticulturist, biologist, or botanist with a minimum B.A. or B.S. in
an appropriate arid environment natural resource field.
   4.   An individual accepted by the planning manager based on his or her
credentials.
G.   Native plant permit approval or denial. A native plant plan application
may be approved, approved conditionally, or denied.
   1.   Where the planning manager determines that the application is in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter the plan shall be approved with
such conditions and assurances attached as necessary to ensure that the site
resource inventory and native plant plan are successfully accomplished.
   2.   Where the planning manager determines that the application is not in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, the application shall be
denied.
   3.   A new native plant plan shall be required to modify, alter or amend an
approved native plant plan.
   4.   Every native plant plan shall expire and become null and void if the
work authorized under the provisions of this chapter is not commenced within
six months from the date the native plant plan was approved unless otherwise
specified as a condition of the plan approval.
   5.   Before work can be recommenced, a new native plant plan shall be
submitted and approved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   6.   The planning manager shall have the authority to grant a single
extension not to exceed 180 days, for completion of the work upon written
request of the applicant. Failure to comply with the time limitation without an
extension authorized by the town shall require application for a new native
plant plan pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
H.   Revegetated areas. Areas the planning manager determines have been
successfully revegetated with the type and density of native plants similar to
adjacent areas may be considered NUOS.
I.   Native plant inventory methodologies. Any combination of at least one or
more of the following three methodologies shall be utilized to prepare a native
plant plan. The applicant shall conform to all requirements of the applicable
set aside methodology, plant inventory methodology or the plant appraisal
methodology.
   1.   Set aside methodology. The preservation and mitigation requirements of
this section shall be satisfied by the set aside of an area of the site as NUOS
in conformance with the following requirements.
      a.   The provisions of this section may be combined, or used in
conjunction with the provisions of other plant protection methodologies of this
section.
      b.   A minimum of 30% of the site shall be set aside in perpetuity as
NUOS.
      c.   The NUOS set aside area shall consist of the area or areas with the
highest resource value as determined by the SRI or other method approved by the
planning manager.
      d.   Boundaries of all NUOS shall be clearly delineated on an aerial
photograph and site plan, development plan, or subdivision plat and fenced for
the duration of any construction activities.
      e.   NUOS protection shall include control of invasive species within the
area.
   2.   Plant inventory methodology. The plant inventory methodology is based
upon a native plant inventory of all plants on the Marana protected native
plant list. The criteria set forth in section
17-11-5 L shall be used to determine the viability and transplantability of
protected native plants as well as to determine the numbers and locations of
plants required for preservation-in-place (PIP) or transplanted-on-site (TOS).
The minimum number of protected native plants required for PIP and/or TOS is
based upon a percentage of the viable and transplantable protected native
plants inventoried on-site.
      a.   The minimum standards for the preservation of protected native
plants in the plant inventory methodology shall be satisfied as follows:
         i.   Endangered species and "crested" saguaros. 100% of federal
endangered species and crested saguaros shall be preserved-in-place or salvaged
and transplanted on-site.
         ii.   Saguaros and ironwoods. At least 50% of all viable saguaros and
ironwood trees shall be preserved-in-place or salvaged and transplanted on-
site.
         iii.   Other protected native plants. At least 30% of each genus and
species of other viable and transplantable protected native plants shall be
preserved-in-place or salvaged and transplanted on-site.
         iv.   The provisions of this subsection may be combined, or used in
conjunction, with other plant preservation methodologies specified in this
section.
   3.   Plant appraisal methodology. The preservation and mitigation
requirements of this section shall be satisfied when the monetary replacement
value is determined for each genus and species of protected native plant which
is removed from the site, damaged, or destroyed. The provisions of this
subsection may be combined, or used in conjunction, with other plant
preservation methodologies specified in this section.
      a.   Site appraisal. A plant appraisal shall be prepared which shall
identify and state the financial value of each protected native plant which is
proposed to be removed from the site, damaged, or destroyed and shall be keyed
to the native plant inventory of the native plant program. The monetary value
of these plants shall be paid into an escrow account of the town's choosing, to
be used for public works landscaping projects within the town. The plant
appraisal shall be conducted by a recognized plant professional according to
the most current methods and procedures accepted by the council of tree and
landscape appraisers.
      b.   Expiration of appraisals. Appraisals shall be current within six
months of submittal of the native plant program and shall be valid for a period
of two years after the plan approval date. A revised appraisal value shall be
required for development which does not proceed before the two year time limit
of the appraisal has expired.
      c.   Amendment of appraisals. Where any protected native plant is removed
from the site, damaged, or destroyed and is not identified on the appraisal
prepared in conformance with the native plant program, the protected native
plants shall be appraised pursuant to this section, and the appraisal shall be
amended to include all additional protected native plants removed and their
financial value.
   4.   Preservation and mitigation requirements. Protected native plants which
are proposed to be or are removed from the site, damaged, or destroyed during
development shall be replaced by plants of the same genus and species at a rate
of 1.5:1 to account for mortality. The native plant preservation plan shall
detail the size and value of replacement plants to demonstrate that the
monetary value of replacement plants shall be equal to the monetary value of
each species of protected native plant which is removed from the site, damaged,
or destroyed.
J.   General provisions and submittal requirements. The following general
provisions and submittal requirements shall apply to the submittal of all
native plant programs and native plant permits:
   1.   Submittals required.
      a.   The native plant program shall consist of the information required
in this section. Additional information may also be required by the planning
manager to insure that the findings of this code are fulfilled.
      b.   Native plant inventory, containing:
         i.   Aerial photograph and site plan overlay at a minimum scale of 1"
= 100' showing the location of all protected native plants within the proposed
affected area and
within ten feet of any construction limits.
         ii.   List of the number, species, size, general condition, and
salvage status of all protected native plants within the proposed affected area
that are to be either transplanted on or off-site or preserved in-place. This
inventory shall be based upon the criteria set forth in section
17-11-5 L of this code.
         iii.   The native plant inventory methodology selected from subsection
17-11-5 I, shall include the proposed location of all protected native plants
to be relocated within the proposed affected area.
         iv.   Native plant holding nursery site location where plant material
is to be stored.
         v.   Locations of riparian and xeroriparian areas.
      c.   If the plant appraisal methodology is selected, a plant appraisal
based on a native plant inventory for each plant to be removed from the site
shall be submitted.
      d.   If the set aside methodology is selected; no grubbing, grading,
construction, or salvaging of any plants on the site shall take place prior to
the submittal and approval. Protected native plants designated shall not be
destroyed, damaged, salvaged, transplanted, or removed from the site except in
accordance with the approved plan.
K.   Plant disposition. The native plant preservation plan shall indicate the
disposition of protected native plants in excess of those needed to meet the
requirements of this code and other applicable regulations. It is encouraged
that all protected native plants that are not proposed to remain on-site be
salvaged and transplanted off-site. The plan shall indicate conformance with
the requirements of the federal endangered species act and the Arizona native
plant law. The planning department shall be provided with verification of
required salvage permits from the U.S. fish and wildlife service for the
applicable endangered and threatened genus and species and verification of
required notification to the Arizona department of agriculture prior to the
issuance of a grading permit.
L.   Criteria. Protected native plants shall not be destroyed, mutilated, or
removed from the premises, or relocated on the premises except in accordance
with an approved native plant program required in conjunction with the issuance
of native plant permit. No native plant program shall be approved until it has
been demonstrated that the following criteria have been met:
   1.   The density/ intensity of the development for the approved land use
shall be an important element in the determination of the base requirements for
plant retention and salvage. A site resource inventory (section
17-11-3) shall be submitted and approved prior to submittal element of the
native plant program. The native plant program shall provide reasonable plant
salvage, protection, and storage and shall insure consistency with existing
neighborhood character.
   2.   The site plan shall be consistent with the site resource inventory and
be designed to protect and incorporate significant on site natural amenities
(i.e. unique or significant vegetation, unique or significant rock
outcroppings, significant riparian habitats and wildlife corridors, etc.) and
minimize the number of salvageable plants which need to be removed to allow
reasonable construction on the site. These relationships shall promote and
enhance the character of the native environment rather than contrast or
domesticate it.
   3.   A vegetation inventory and analysis shall provide a clear,
comprehensive review and listing of plant materials, their condition and
physical relationships on site so as to aid the site planning and determination
of plant salvageability. The native plant viability and transplantability
status shall be determined for each native plant of the minimum size and shall
be used to determine the numbers and locations of plants required for
preservation. The following plant viability and transplantability criteria
shall be used:
      a.   Plant viability criteria. Plant viability is based upon plant
health, age and form. Plants rated low are not considered viable and are not
required to be assessed according to the transplantability criteria. Plants
rated medium or high are considered viable and shall be further assessed under
the transplantability criteria.
         i.   High. A high plant viability rating shall be assigned to plants
meeting the following criteria.
            a)   Health: plant is good to excellent with no major infestations
of insects or apparent diseases.
            b)   Age: plant age is young or mature with likely chance of long
survival.
            c)   Form: plant is relatively undamaged with a healthy branching
habit.
         ii.   Medium. A medium rating shall be assigned to plants which do not
meet all of the criteria for a high rating but have sufficient merit to warrant
preservation, in the opinion of the qualified plant professional conducting the
inventory.
         iii.   Low. A low plant viability rating shall be given to plants
meeting any one or more of the following:
            a)   Health: plant health is poor. Generally the result of severe
infestations of pests or diseases or lack of water over time.
            b)   Age: Plant is in a state of decline, suggesting a low
probability of lengthy survival.
            c)   Form: Plant form and character is severely damaged. For trees,
this may include new branches from large, old, dead trunks or weak branching
habit.
      b.   Plant transplantability criteria. Plant transplantability is based
upon plant genus and species, size, soils, context and topography. The
following five categories shall be inventoried to determine the ability to
salvage the viable plants, which will not be preserved-in-place. Plants rated
low for transplantability should not be considered for salvage and transplant.
Plants rated medium to high that are not preserved-in-place should be
considered for salvage and transplant on-site or off-site.
         i.   High. A high rating for transplantability shall be assigned to
viable plants which also meet the following criteria:
            a)   Genus and species: Has a high survival rate for
reestablishment after transplant.
            b)   Size: Overall plant dimensions are suitable for transplanting
based upon the genus and species.
            c)   Soils: Can be excavated, are cohesive, and seem capable of
supporting the rootball system.
            d)   Topography: Permits access with the appropriate equipment
needed to remove plants and their rootball systems.
            e)   Context: Adjacent plants do not possess a likely interference
with root systems or interfere with plant removal.
         ii.   Medium: A medium transplantability rating shall be assigned to
plants which do not meet all of the criteria for a high rating but do have
sufficient merit, in the opinion of the qualified plant professional conducting
the inventory, to warrant transplanting.
         iii.   Low: A low rating shall be assigned to plants which meet the
following criteria:
            a)   Genus and species: Has a low survival rate for reestablishing
after transplant.
            b)   Size: Overall plant dimensions are not suitable for
transplanting based upon the genus and species.
            c)   Soils: Too rocky, sandy, or shallow to excavate a cohesive
rootball system.
            d)   Topography: Seriously limits access to the specimen by the
appropriate equipment (i.e., steep slopes, rock barriers).
            e)   Context: Adjacent plants interfere with removal or present
likely conflicts with the rootball system.
   4.   Areas of the site shall be inventoried to estimate representative
numbers of protected native plants. Areas of the site must be inventoried by
sampling typical identifiable areas for each genus and species and estimating
representative plant numbers per square acre of the total site area. The
samples must be representative of the viable species found on site and shall
not be less than 20% of the total site. If different plant communities (upland,
riparian, valley floor, etc.) are found on one site, then a sample of not less
than 20% of each defined community, shall be inventoried.
   5.   All plants which are salvaged and transplanted on-site shall be rated
as viable and transplantable prior to relocation.
   6.   All protected native plants shall be properly tagged and/ or permitted
in accordance with the federal endangered species act, the Arizona native plant
law, and this article, as applicable.
   7.   Once the inventory by sampling is complete, then the field tagging and
protection of those plants to be preserved-in-place (PIP) or transplanted-on-
site (TOS) can take place.
   8.   All PIP plants must be identified on an aerial photo and fenced for
protection prior to subsequent grading of the site and construction activities.
Fencing should include sufficient area to avoid compaction of plant roots.
Plants within a designated natural undisturbed open space, under any method, do
not require individual tagging since their boundaries will be fenced.
   9.   Plants to be TOS may be identified and included in a TOS 'pool'. A
summary report shall be prepared that identifies all TOS plants by quantity,
genus and species. This summary shall be located on the native plant program
plan and any associated landscape plan. The selection of specific TOS plants
may vary according to field conditions and therefore, final selection will be
made by the "plant professional" and the salvage contractor. Once the total
numbers of plants to be TOS have been identified in the field, they must be
field tagged for TOS.
   10.   All protected native plants scheduled to remain in place (except those
scheduled to remain in place as part of a NUOS area) or authorized for
relocation by the approved native plant permit must be tagged with an embossed
metal inventory number which cross references to the inventory list and aerial
photograph submitted as part of the native plant program, so that the
disposition of each plant can be easily identified. Tags required by this
article shall be affixed in a visible location on the plant, preferably on the
north side of each plant, whenever possible. Once affixed, the tags shall not
be removed until the plants are removed or relocated in compliance with the
native plant permit and a final inspection has been made.
   11.   All protected native vegetation to remain in-place as part of a NUOS
area shall be adequately protected during grading and construction through
placement of a fence barrier surrounding the entire NUOS area. NUOS plants that
are to remain in-place as part of a NUOS area, do not require tagging.
   12.   A conceptual analysis and design of the site vegetation and/or
landscaping shall insure that the character of the project be consistent with
the natural density, distribution, and maturity of vegetation on adjacent
properties.
   13.   If the conceptual analysis and design reveals an excess supply of
onsite salvageable plants, the relocation program shall designate alternative
projects within areas of suitable habitat, in municipal, county, state and
federal reclamation and re-vegetation projects in addition to off-site
privately owned properties.
   14.   To assure full implementation and completion of the approved plans and
permits, the town will require a mutual consent agreement between the town and
the applicant signed and guaranteed by cash or a bond acceptable to the town
attorney in an amount set by the town manager to guarantee performance of the
provisions of the mutual consent agreement.
   15.   On-site monitoring of all aspects of site clearing, grading, plant
protection, preservation, salvage, and mitigation shall be provided during
project construction, at the expense of the developer, for all residential
development that is over five acres and for all commercial and industrial
development that is over one acre. The monitoring shall be performed by an
individual who is qualified in arid lands native plant resource identification
and protection as specified in subsection
17-11-5 F. The monitor shall provide periodic progress reports to the developer
outlining the status of work accomplished and any problems encountered. The
town shall receive a copy of these reports for the project file.
      a.   The monitor shall be responsible for an assessment of the condition
of the site's plants one year after the final inspection has been performed on
the site. The monitor shall visit the site and prepare a report on plant
status, including general plant condition, the identification of plants under
stress and the appropriate method to relieve the stress, and recommendations
for replacement of plants that are dead or dying. Dead or dying plants shall be
replaced with the same size plant at a one-to-one ratio of like genus and
species. Copies of the report shall be submitted to the site owner/developer
and to the planning department. The owner shall respond to the plant needs as
outlined in the status report within 90 days of report submittal or within a
shorter period if required to improve the health of stressed plants and prevent
plant loss.
17-11-6 Protected native plant list
All sites proposed for development shall be inventoried for each of the
protected native plants set forth on the town of Marana protected native plant

department of water resources and are not covered in this chapter. All other
building uses are covered in subsection
17-11-7 B.
   9.   Landscape designs shall be in harmony with the environmental context of
the development site.
      a.   Plants shall be selected from the town's official regulatory plant
list.
      b.   Trees and shrubs.
         i.   Trees shall be at least fifteen-gallon size at planting time.
         ii.   Shrubs shall be at least one-gallon size at planting time.
         iii.   Trees and shrubs shall be planted so that at maturity they do
not interfere with overhead or underground service lines, traffic sight lines
and the property rights of adjacent property owners.
         iv.   Trees with invasive roots which are planted near public
sidewalks or curbs shall be installed with suitable root diverters to minimize
heaving of those improvements.
         v.   Plants shall be grouped, clustered or unevenly spaced to prevent
an unnatural landscape appearance.
         vi.   Multi-stemmed plants shall be included in the planting matrix to
provide a natural looking landscape.
      c.   Groundcover.
         i.   Inorganic groundcover shall be used in combination with trees and

groundcover.
         ii.   All unpaved landscape areas shall be planted with shrubs,
accents or vines, or covered with appropriate organic or inorganic groundcover.
      d.   Irrigation and water features.
         i.   All water use for landscape irrigation and enhancement shall
conform to the Arizona groundwater code, A.R.S. title 45, chapter 2.
         ii.   Irrigation plans shall indicate how each introduced planting is
served by a water-conserving, underground irrigation system. Water harvesting
and drip irrigation are recommended methods. Irrigation shall be designed to
avoid watering hardscape areas and built structures.
         iii.   Reclaimed water irrigation shall be encouraged for all
landscaped and turf areas.
         iv.   Landscape designs shall be integrated with hydrology, grading
and earthwork plans for the site and shall make maximum use of site stormwater
run-off for irrigation purposes.
         v.   Water design features, such as ponds and fountains, shall be at a
scale and design compatible with the desert environment.
      e.   Natural and built features.
         i.   Earth berms shall be designed with a reverse curve at the
base to allow a natural transition to existing grades. They shall not exceed a
slope of 3:1 and shall be adequately covered with plant material, groundcover
or rip-rap to control erosion. Planted berms shall be designed to retain

be buried to provide a natural appearance.
      f.   Oasis exception.
         i.   An oasis area is a zone of planting where non-drought tolerant
plant materials and turf are allowed. Turf use shall not exceed 20% of the
total landscaped area. This area must be located near an area of high
pedestrian use such as an entry, a recreation area, break area, clubhouse,
courtyard, seating or dining area. Consideration will be made for areas
developed as special focal points. There are two methods of determining the
allowed oasis area. The calculation must be shown on the plans.
            a)   Multifamily uses: Multiply net site area by 5%.
            b)   All other uses: Multiply net site area by 2.5%.
         ii.   If a site is being phased, only that phase or area presented for
development will be considered a part of the net site area.
F.   Landscape buffer standards.
   1.   Purpose.
      a.   Landscape buffers provide the following four distinct functions:
         i.   Serve as landscape screens to mitigate visual impacts;
         ii.   Provide a landscape setback to reduce noise;
         iii.   Physically separate incompatible adjacent land uses; and
         iv.   Provide an aesthetic transition between adjacent compatible land
uses.
      b.   In addition, landscape buffers function to eliminate or minimize
potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, and signs.
They also visually soften and screen unsightly buildings or parking areas.
Landscape buffers are also designed to ensure a desired character along public
streets and roads.
   2.   A landscape buffer may be used for passive recreation. It may contain
pedestrian, bike and equestrian trails. Where appropriate, linkages shall be
encouraged within or along a landscape buffer as long as the total width of the
buffer is maintained, and all other regulations of the code are met. Swimming
pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf courses, parking lots, or other uses
requiring structures or removal of vegetation shall not be permitted within a
landscape buffer.
   3.   Landscape buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or
parcel, extending to the property or boundary lines and shall be determined in
accordance with the landscape buffers matrices set forth in subparagraph 5
below.
   4.   Landscape buffer plant requirements shall be determined by application
of the landscape buffers matrices set forth in subparagraph 5 below.
   5.   Landscape buffers matrices. The numbers in table 1 (Landscape buffers
matrix - between zoning districts) and table 2 (Landscape buffers matrix -
street frontage) refer to the codes in table 3 (Landscape buffers matrix

5    10' minimum     1.0 per 100 sq. ft.
 
   a.   For every three shrubs planted, one 15 gallon tree shall be planted.
Example: using code 1: a 1000 square foot landscape buffer area would need 15
plants: 12 one gallon shrubs and four 15 gallon trees. Earth berms of a minimum
size of two cubic yards (approximately 8'W x 4.5'L x 1.5'H) may be used in lieu
of three shrubs not to exceed 25% of shrubs.
   b.   Ground cover plants are required in addition to above plants. Ground
cover equal to 20% of the total number of trees and shrubs will be located in
the landscape buffer area.
G.   Additional landscape buffer options.
   1.   Landscape buffer agreements. With the approval of the planning manager,
property owners may enter into agreements to use abutting land to provide some
or all of a required landscape buffer.
   2.   Reduction of landscape buffer requirements. The landscape buffer
requirement may be reduced if a six foot high decorative masonry wall is
constructed and the wall requirement is noted on the approved subdivision plat
and landscape plan. If a wall is used as part of the landscape buffer
requirement, the calculations for plant materials shall be reduced by one-
third.
   3.   All landscape buffers are required to be landscaped. The landscape
buffers shall contain the following minimum planting materials; six - 15 gallon
trees, 15 - one gallon shrubs and ten -one gallon ground cover / accent plants
per 1500 square feet of area. Existing natural desert may be utilized to meet
or exceed these planting requirements. Where the number of existing natural
desert plants do not meet the minimum landscape buffer planting requirement of
this section, the natural desert plants shall be supplemented with additional
native plants transplanted from on-site or from nursery plants. The applicant
is encouraged to utilize on-site native plants within the landscape buffers
where possible.
   4.   Natural drainage ways and existing natural vegetation. Natural drainage
ways and existing natural vegetation may be used for screening if approved, in
writing by the planning manager, provided such uses are consistent with the
regulations contained in
chapter 17-15 (floodplain and erosion hazard management code). Natural drainage
ways and existing vegetation used for this purpose shall be a minimum of 20
feet wide.
H.   General.
   1.   All trees and plants shall meet Arizona nursery association minimum
guidelines as to caliper and height and the town's official regulatory plant
list.
   2.   Low-water plants found on the town's regulatory plant list shall be
used.
   3.   All landscaped areas shall be irrigated using an underground drip
irrigation system. All landscaping shall be irrigated from a secondary, non-
potable water source where available.
   4.   Trees within landscaped areas should be sited and spaced to avoid
conflicts with overhead light fixtures.
   5.   Landscape plans shall be coordinated with above-and below-ground
utilities to avoid irresolvable conflicts at the time of installation.

five shrubs and groundcover plants as required.
   9.   Landscaped areas in parking lots are encouraged to utilize any
combination of decorative paving, inert groundcover, berms and additional plant
materials.
   10.   Planters, walls and fences adjacent to the parking areas shall have a
protective six inch curb to shield against damage to plants and irrigation
heads.
      a.   Curb cuts may be strategically incorporated to encourage stormwater
to drain to depressed planting areas.
      b.   Appropriate paving should be used where pedestrians are likely to
cross landscaped areas.
   11.   Protective concrete curbs and standard concrete wheel stops are
required where walls and fences abut driveways and parking stalls.

workers and pedestrians. Sight visibility and plant material selection and
location are important factors. This section also is intended to promote the
harvesting of water within the landscape area.
A.   Hardscape shall be designed to deter materials from washing onto sidewalks
and the roadway. The toe of slopes with decomposed granite shall be located 12"
minimum from walls and curb, and shall end in reverse curves.
B.   Boulders shall have a maximum 18" exposed above grade.
C.   Bullnoses or any median three feet or less in width shall not be planted.
D.   All sight visibility triangles shall be indicated on plans. No mature
plants over 18" or tree canopies growing lower than six feet shall be allowed
in these zones.
E.   Shrubs shall be placed so that when the mature size is reached, the edge
of the shrub is one foot from the curb.
F.   Tree trunks shall be located a minimum of seven feet from median curb and
nine feet from right-of-way curb.
G.   Planting of tree materials which shall overhang into roadway at maturity
is discouraged. Overhanging branches are a hazard to bicyclists and have the
potential of being injured or destroyed by high profile automobiles.
17-11-10 Maintenance
A.   Continuous maintenance provisions shall be provided on the landscape plan.
Maintenance shall include a plan, which accommodates the following:
   1.   The irrigation system should be designed to assure consistent water
coverage of newly planted areas, regular watering of non-native species and
specific watering schedule per plant type or xeriscape zone.
   2.   Pruning methods shall allow maximum shading while preventing
obstruction into walkways, curb areas, drives, and line of sight triangles.
Tree clearance for pedestrian and automobile passage shall be a minimum of
seven feet once the tree has reached maturity. Pruning shall be consistent with
the natural growth pattern or characteristic form of the plant. Opaque hedges
are permitted.
   3.   Ornamental landscaping shall require regular fertilizing, aerating and
mulching schedules to encourage plant growth and water conservation.
   4.   General landscape maintenance such as the clearing of debris, litter
and weeds shall be included on a regular maintenance schedule.
   5.   Any plant material in areas of required landscaping that does not
survive shall be replaced with an equivalent size and species within 30 days on
an ongoing basis. Failure to replace dead plant material within the specified
time period shall constitute a zoning violation.
   6.   Irrigation shall be routinely tested and shall be repaired and replaced
as necessary to prevent excess spray or water to planted areas, curbs and
pavement, clogged emitters at each plant, and flooding of low lying areas.
Improper irrigation system maintenance which results in pooling or runoff of
excess water shall result in a warning. Failure to resolve the problem within
30 days shall constitute a zoning violation.
   7.   Architectural and built structures, sculpture or decorative features,
and exterior furnishings (benches, trash receptacles, etc.) shall be maintained
to prevent injury, maintain access, and prevent defacement.
Ordinance 2022.006 amended Section 17-11-10 A.5-6

program shall cause immediate suspension of all inspection activity. Inspection
(s) shall not resume until a sum of money is paid to the town for the purpose
of replacing and maintaining protected native plant materials as required in
the approved native plant program.
B.   The planning commission shall determine the sum of money to be paid to the
town from the following schedule:
   1.   Protected native trees - $300 per caliper inch (measured one foot above
ground level).
   2.   Protected native cacti - $200 per foot.
   3.   Maximum per plant - $10,000.
   4.   Determination of the sum of money to be paid to the town pursuant to
this section shall be based upon the type, size, density, distribution, and
condition of plant materials that existed on the property prior to the
violation, or upon inspection of the remains of destroyed plant materials or
other physical evidence as may be available.
C.   The sum of money required by this subsection shall be used to replace
removed or damaged plant materials whose retention was required by this
ordinance and to maintain replacement plant materials for a period of three
years. Additionally, 15% of the total amount payable shall be kept by the town
as payment for the enforcement of these regulations and administration of the
agreement specified below.
D.   Prior to issuance of any permits for development of the property on which
the violation occurred, the property owner shall enter into an agreement with a
landscape installation and maintenance service and the town to ensure
replacement and three years maintenance of the replacement plant materials, to
provide disbursement of the sum of money for the purposes of replacement and to
pay administrative costs. The sum of money paid to the town in excess of the
amounts specified in the agreement shall be refunded.
E.   An on-site visit will be conducted by staff at the time of final
installation to approve compliance with the native plant program and permit and
the approved landscape plan prior to authorizing a certificate of occupancy.
The zoning inspector may recommend correction of non-compliance items that will
need to be corrected. Re-evaluation shall be made within an agreed upon time
frame. Prior to receiving a certificate of approval or occupancy, all non-
compliance items shall be completed to specification in this chapter. The
property owner, agent or other authorized personnel will be notified in writing
of the non-compliance items by planning department staff.
F.   The planning department staff will periodically spot-inspect all native
plant salvage projects and all landscape installations for compliance with the
approved native plant program and permit and the approved landscape plans and
on-going maintenance as required in this chapter.
17-11-12 Plan approval prior to permitting
The native plant preservation plan shall be submitted to the planning
department prior to or concurrently with any plan(s) and applicable fees
required for development approval, including a grubbing/ grading plan,
landscape plan, site plan, development plan, or preliminary plat. No permits
shall be issued prior to submittal and approval of the native plant program.
17-11-13 Assurances
A.   Native plant assurances. The town may require that implementation and
compliance with an approved native plant preservation plan be guaranteed by
assurances, such as performance bonds, a letter of credit from a financial
institution, or a third party trust acceptable to the town, as determined by
town policy and regulation.
B.   Landscape maintenance assurances. An approved final plat shall require
covenants or assurances which:
   1.   Ensure the continued maintenance of required landscaping, buffering and
associated irrigation systems;
   2.   Assign responsibility of maintenance to the property owner, lessee,
heirs, assigns, agent, a homeowner's association or other liable entity; and
   3.   Ensure that any plant materials included in an approved landscape plan
that do not survive after installation are replaced with plant materials of the
same or like species of equal size within 30 days of the plant's demise.

(ASM) working under the appropriate ASM survey and recovery permits. A list of
ASM permitted consultants is available at the ASM website: https://
statemuseum.arizona.edu/crm.
17-12-5 Archaeological review
A.   All proposed development projects within the town shall be reviewed for
their potential impact on archaeological resources and all impacts addressed
prior to the issuance of any permits. The process will typically follow the
steps outlined here:
   1.   Records check.
      a.   A qualified archaeologist working for the developer will need to
check site records with ASM to determine if the project area contains
previously recorded cultural resources.
      b.   The archaeologist will make recommendations for further action based
on the information provided in the report.
      c.   Town staff will review the recommendation and determine if further
action is required.
   2.   Survey and assessment.
      a.   If it is deemed necessary by the town, the developer will have a
qualified archaeologist conduct an on the ground survey of the project area and
all other project related areas.
      b.   The archaeologist will then submit a report to the town that
includes all findings and recommendations for further actions.
      c.   Town staff will review the submitted report and determine if further
action is required.
   3.   Testing.
      a.   If the survey report recommends further investigation of the site,
the developer will have a qualified archaeologist develop a testing plan.
      b.   Results of testing must be submitted and approved prior to ground
disturbing activities.
      c.   After a testing plan has been approved and all work completed by the
archaeologist, a final report will be submitted to the town indicating results
of testing and recommendations for further work or clearance.
   4.   Mitigation.
      a.   If mitigation is required, then the developer will have a qualified
archaeologist develop a mitigation plan. Mitigation options may include, but
are not limited to, site avoidance, monitoring during construction, and full
data recovery.
      b.   Town staff will review the submitted plan and either concur with the
plan, or request revisions.
      c.   After the mitigation plan has been approved and all work completed
by the archaeologist, a final report will be submitted to the town indicating
what mitigation measures were taken and that all archaeological requirements
for the project have been addressed.
   5.   Federalized projects. If a project has an element that requires a
federal permit, the above steps will still be required, but the lead federal
agency will review all reports and provide cultural clearance for the project.
The town will be the lead on sites within the project area that are not under
jurisdiction of the lead federal agency.
17-12-6 Development of cultural resources
A.   If work is being performed without first having obtained cultural
resources clearance, all work shall cease. The town may seek an injunction and
any other remedy at law or equity to enforce the stop order.
B.   When a previously unidentified archaeological site is discovered in the
course of construction, the property owner immediately shall notify the town.
The town will then assess the findings and determine what type of
archaeological work the developer will need to have done.
C.   If human remains, including human skeletal remains, cremations, and/or
ceremonial objects and funerary objects are found during discovery, scientific
excavation or construction, ground disturbing activities shall cease in the
immediate vicinity of the discovery. State law (A.R.S. § 41-844 and A.R.S. §

following criteria may be considered for designation as protected areas under
this chapter:
   1.   The peak point or ridge line lies within one mile of a public preserve.
   2.   The peak or ridge is a dominant feature in the surrounding landscape or
constitutes a significant linking element of a dominant geographic feature.
   3.   The peak or ridge is an extension of a mountain, major hill or ridge,
or other significant terrain feature, from a designated public preserve.
   4.   The peak or ridge is visible from a scenic route or a road leading to a
designated trailhead.
   5.   The peak or ridge is visible to the community at large.
C.   Annexation. A peak or ridge designated by the county as a protected peak
or ridge prior to annexation by the town shall be designated by the town as a
protected peak or ridge in the ordinance establishing original town zoning for
the property.
D.   Procedure. A town-initiated protected peak or ridge designation or any
amendment to an existing protected peak or ridge designation shall be
considered and adopted in the same manner as a rezoning of the affected
property.
E.   Minor modification. The council or planning commission may modify the 300
foot setback from a protected peak or ridge upon finding that the request meets
all of the following conditions:
   1.   The proposed development is for a single family residence.

that the development complies with all requirements of this chapter during the
period of construction.
C.   Surveying and staking. The lot or parcel shall be surveyed, staked, and
inspected by a registered civil engineer, to determine and assure compliance
with this chapter and the conditions of subdivision or development approval.
17-14-5 Average cross slope calculations
A.   Average cross slope of a lot or parcel will be determined by using the
following equation:
IxLx0.0023
A
B.   For purposes of the equation set forth in paragraph A above, the following
values are assigned:
   1.   I = Contour interval (maximum 10') in feet
   2.   L = Combined length in feet of all contour lines measured on the lot or
parcel
   3.   0.0023 = Conversion of square feet into acres x 100
   4.   A = Lot or parcel area in acres
C.   The average cross slope shall be rounded off to the nearest whole number.
When .5 or higher is computed, the number shall be rounded off to the next
highest whole number.
D.   The average cross slope of a lot or parcel proposed for residential
purposes only may be reduced by establishing a natural area on the lot or
parcel and revising the average cross slope calculation to delete the natural
area from the equation.
E.   Natural areas set aside in any division of land shall not be included in
the average cross slope calculation, neither in the combined length of contour
(L) nor in the lot or parcel area (A). The total acreage of the lot or parcel
may be used to calculate the number of dwelling units based on allowable
density, provided that all other applicable provisions of this section are met.
F.   The average cross slope is used for determining slope density requirements
for residential development only.

17-15-1 General information
A.   Statutory authorization. In A.R.S. § 48-3610, the Arizona legislature
enabled the town to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3603
designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry.
B.   Findings of fact.
   1.   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   2.   Flood losses may be exacerbated by the cumulative effects of
obstructions in special flood hazard areas, which increase flood depths and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage, also contribute to the flood loss.
C.   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   1.   To protect human life and health;
   2.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   3.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   4.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   5.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
special flood hazard areas;
   6.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas
caused by flooding;
   7.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
special flood hazard area;
   8.   To ensure that those who occupy the special flood hazard areas assume
responsibility for their actions; and
   9.   To participate in and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and
disaster relief.
D.   Methods of reducing flood losses. To accomplish its purposes, this chapter
includes methods and provisions for:
   1.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   4.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   5.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

17-15-11 (floodplain variance procedure) of this chapter, means the exceptional
hardship which would result from a failure to grant the requested floodplain
variance. The floodplain board requires that the floodplain variance be
exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
floodplain variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the
property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than
originally intended.
   38.   Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
   39.   Historic structure. Any structure that is:

secretary; or
      d.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         i.   by an approved state program as determined by the secretary; or
         ii.   directly by the secretary in states without approved programs.

with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of
water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
   41.   Locally regulated floodplain. Floodplains in the town associated with
washes and/or sheet flow areas having a base flood discharge of 50 cfs or more.
   42.   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement (see “basement” definition). An unfinished or flood resistant
enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor,
provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   43.   Manufactured home. See definition in section
17-1-6(A)(119).
   44.   Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or

replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the
amount of depreciation that has accrued since the structure was constructed.
The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost
factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized
by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be
determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the
structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain
administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external
obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors
different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides
may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an
independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of
the differences.
   46.   Mean sea level. For purposes of the national flood insurance program,
the NGVD or NAVD, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s FIRM
are referenced.
   47.   New construction. For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means structures for which
the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   48.   New manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the community.
   49.   Obstruction. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,

projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   50.   One-hundred year flood (100-year flood). A common name for the flood
having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
(See “base flood” definition)
   51.   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle that is:
      a.   Built on a single chassis;
      b.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection;
      c.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
      d.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   52.   Regulatory flood elevation. An elevation one foot above the Base Flood
elevation for a watercourse for which the base flood elevation has been
determined or as determined by the criteria developed by the director of ADWR
for all other watercourses.
   53.   Regulatory floodplain. An area associated with a watercourse,
including its channel, or any other floodplain or floodprone area that would be

   55.   Repetitive loss structure. A structure covered by a contract for flood
insurance issued pursuant to the FIA that has incurred flood-related damage on
two occasions during any ten year period ending on the date of the event for
which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage,
on average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure at the
time of each such flood event. In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must
have paid the previous qualifying claim.
   56.   Retention. A drainage system which stops the downstream progress of
flood waters by employing methods of containment and storage and uses
infiltration, evaporation or re-use to dispose of stored waters, thereby
eliminating basin contributions to the downstream flood peaks or volumes.
   57.   Riverine. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   58.   Sheet flow area. (See “area of shallow flooding” definition)
   59.   Special flood hazard area (SFHA). An area defined by FEMA within a
community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given
year (base flood). These areas are designated as Zone A, AO, AH and AE on the
FIRMs, and other areas determined by the criteria adopted by the director of
ADWR.
   60.   Start of construction. Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   61.   Structure. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank, which is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home. “Structure” for insurance coverage purposes means a walled and roofed
building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above
ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a
permanent foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building
while in the course of construction, alteration or repair, but does not include
building materials or supplies intended for use in such a construction,
alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed
building on the premises.
   62.   Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained
by a structure on two separate occasions during a rolling ten-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   63.   Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      a.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or,
      b.   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   64.   Variance. See "Floodplain variance."
   65.   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in
violation until that documentation is provided.
   66.   Water surface elevation. The height, in relation to the NGVD, NAVD, or
other datum of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains
of riverine and ponding areas. See also base flood elevation.
   67.   Watercourse. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or
other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur (e.g. the regulatory floodplain).
Ordinance 2022.006 amended Section 17-15-2.
Ordinance 2024.011 adopted revisions proposed by Resolution 2024-031 which
amended 17-15-2, paragraph A.16, and paragraphs B.1. and B. 43.
17-15-3 General provisions
A.   This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the
corporate limits of the town. In addition, this chapter shall also apply to the
following areas:
   1.   FEMA zone X-500, also known as shaded zone X, as it pertains to the
tortolita mountain alluvial fan.
   2.   Local floodplains associated with washes and/or sheet flow having a
base flood discharge of 50 cfs or more.
   3.   Areas within the erosion hazard setback of a watercourse.
   4.   All floodplains/flood-prone areas and erosion hazard setbacks
identified on previously and subsequently recorded subdivision plats.
   5.   All floodplains/flood-prone areas and erosion hazard setbacks
identified on previously and subsequently drainage studies commissioned by the
town engineer.
B.   Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas.
   1.   The regulated areas of this chapter as outlined in subsection A of this
section are derived from a variety of sources, whose hydrologic and hydraulic
data and maps of delineation are kept on file by the town at 11555 West Civic
Center Drive, Marana, AZ 85653, Marana municipal complex, public works
department. This information includes or will include:
      a.   The special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA in a scientific
and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Pima
County Arizona and incorporated areas, revised June 16, 2011,” with
accompanying FIRMs dated February 8, 1999 and all subsequent amendments and/or
revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter. The FIS, FIRMs and amendments and corrections to the maps are all kept
on file.
      b.   The FIS and FIRMs may be supplemented by studies for other areas
that allow implementation of this chapter. The floodplain board, within the
limits of the town, shall require developers to delineate, within areas where
development is ongoing or imminent, floodplains consistent with the criteria
developed by FEMA, the director of water resources and the town.
      c.   Due to the episodic nature of natural flood events and the resulting
changes to hydrologic and hydraulic conditions along watercourses within the
town, base flood peak discharges, flow volumes, and associated regulatory
floodplain and erosion hazard areas are subject to continuous revision. At a
minimum, base flood values and base flood elevations shall meet or exceed the
current values established by FEMA and reflect historic flood information and
general, current watershed conditions. Current regulatory floodplain and
erosion hazard area maps will be maintained by the floodplain administrator for

         ii.   on stem walls or pilings so that the bottom of the structural
frame and any attached electrical appliances is at or above the regulatory
flood elevation.
      b.   Lots shall be large enough to permit steps.
      c.   Pilings or stem wall shall be placed in stable soil.
      d.   Pilings shall be no more than ten feet apart.
   4.   Certification that the installation of a manufactured home meets all of
the requirements of this section is required. Such certification shall be
provided by the person installing the manufactured home, the owner, the
developer of a manufactured home park or subdivision, or an agency regulating
manufactured home placement, whichever is deemed appropriate by the floodplain
administrator. Certification of lowest structural frame member elevation shall
be in accordance with section
17-15-10 B. 3. i.
G.   Standards for recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on
site shall either:
   1.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully licensed
and ready for highway use. (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if
it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
   2.   Meet the permit requirements of subsection
17-15-9 E of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
manufactured homes in subsection
17-15-10 F.
H.   Standards for critical facilities. Critical facilities shall be regulated
to withstand the 500-year event. Critical facilities shall be required to meet
the following requirements:
   1.   Structures or facilities that produce, use or store more than 100,000
gallons of highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive
materials shall be located outside of the 500-year FEMA floodplain (shaded zone
X) and locally regulated floodplain calculated at the 500 year interval.
   2.   Public and private utility facilities that are vital to maintaining or
restoring normal services to flooded areas before, during and after a flood
shall be located outside of the FEMA special flood hazard area and the locally
regulated floodplain. Such facilities shall be designed to avoid the 500-year
floodplain or certify the safety of the development per subsection
17-15-10 H. 4.
   3.   Police stations, fire stations, hospitals, nursing homes, assisted
living homes, public vehicle and equipment storage facilities, emergency
operations centers and schools designated to be used as temporary shelters
shall be located outside the FEMA special flood hazard area and the locally
regulated floodplain. Such facilities shall be designed to avoid the 500-year
floodplain or certify the safety of the development per subsection
17-15-10 H. 4.
   4.   The developers of critical facilities referenced in subsections 2 and 3
above shall certify the safety of the development by providing the following
information to the satisfaction of the floodplain administrator:

   7.   The 500-year water surface elevations shall be delineated by the
developer on the preliminary/final plats, development plans and improvement
plans.
   8.   Toe downs and bank protection shall be designed to withstand the 500-
year flood.
I.   Standards for excavations, including sand and gravel operations.
   1.   Excavations, including sand and gravel operations may be permitted
provided the following minimum conditions are met in addition to any other
requirements per the town code. Additional conditions apply for operations
occurring within a regulatory floodway as required in subsection
17-15-10 J.
   2.   Extraction of sand, gravel and other materials is allowed provided that
excavations are not so located or of such depth, or width, or length or
combination of depth-width-length as to present a hazard to structures
(including but not limited to roads, bridges, culverts, and utilities), to the
banks of watercourses, to other property, or which adversely affects
groundwater recharge.
   3.   No stockpiling is permitted within special flood hazard areas of
materials or tailings that may obstruct, divert, or retard the flow of
floodwaters except as reviewed and accepted by the floodplain administrator on
an individual floodplain use permit basis.
   4.   Due to the rapidly changing hydraulic characteristics of watercourses
in the town, and the effects excavations have on these characteristics,
floodplain use permits for excavations shall only be issued for a limited time
period not to exceed one year, subject to annual renewal and review by the
floodplain administrator. Renewals will only be granted after receipt and
acceptance of a report by the operator showing that the sand and gravel
excavations remain in compliance with the conditions of the previous floodplain
use permit, current floodplain conditions and all current related floodplain
management regulations.
   5.   In addition to those conditions provided for elsewhere, floodplain use
permits for excavations may impose site specific conditions based upon
hydraulics and sediment transport regarding the area and location in which
excavations are allowed, the maximum amount of material to be excavated, and
other reasonable restraints on the methods of operating in relationship to the
floodplain conditions.
   6.   The floodplain administrator may require hydrologic, hydraulic and
geomorphic analyses addressing the existing conditions as well as the impacts
under the proposed method of operation.
J.   Floodway requirements
   1.   Located within special flood hazard areas established in subsection
17-15-3 B are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential. Encroachments are prohibited in the
floodway, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development. The following subsections clarify how the floodway may be
developed.
   2.   The following open space uses are permitted within the floodway to the
extent that they are not prohibited by any provision of this Title or any other
ordinance, law or regulation, and provided they do not require fill,
excavation, or the storage of materials or equipment:
      a.   Agricultural uses, including general farming, pasture, grazing,
outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, sod farming,
and wild crop harvesting.
      b.   Industrial-commercial uses such as loading areas, airport landing
strips, and parking areas.
      c.   Private and public recreational uses, including golf courses, tennis
courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launch ramps,
swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish
hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting
and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding trails.
      d.   Accessory residential uses, including lawn gardens, parking areas
and play areas.
      e.   Excavations, including sand and gravel operations may occur in the
floodway under the following conditions in addition to those required in
subsection
17-15-10 I:
      f.   There shall be no stockpiling of materials or tailings within the
floodway.
      g.   Excavations may be allowed only in those reaches of watercourses
which have, at a minimum, a balanced sediment system; that is, the sediment
coming into the reach is equal to or greater than the sediment leaving the
reach and the long term sediment balance for the entire river system indicates
that the stream channel will aggrade.
      h.   Flood control structures designed to protect life or property from
the dangers or hazards of floodwaters are permitted provided all other
provisions of this chapter are met.
      i.   No use shall be allowed which:
         i.   Acting alone or in combination with existing or future uses
creates danger or hazard to life or property. In determining whether a use
creates a danger or hazard to property, the floodplain administrator may
require a certification by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer
that the proposed use will not result in any increase in the floodway
elevations during the occurrence of the base flood nor will the proposed use
divert, retard or obstruct the flow of flood waters.
         ii.   Increases the regulatory floodway elevation.
         iii.   Adversely effects groundwater recharge.
         iv.   Increases erosion potential upstream and/or downstream.
         v.   Places a waste disposal system wholly or partially in a floodway.
K.   Erosion hazard setback requirements
   1.   Close proximity to watercourses poses a hazard to development due to
lateral erosion. Per subsection
17-15-3 A, the erosion hazard setback area of a watercourse is a land covered
by this chapter.
   2.   Along natural watercourses where unusual geology, sinuosity or similar
physical conditions exist, the erosion hazard setback shall be established on a
case-by-case basis by the floodplain administrator, unless an engineering study
is done to establish the limits by an Arizona registered professional civil
engineer and accepted by the floodplain administrator.
   3.   Along incised natural watercourses where no unusual geology, sinuosity
or similar conditions exist, a standard setback measured from the top of the
primary channel bank shall be provided at the time of development. The setback
may be reduced by an engineering analysis performed by an Arizona registered
professional civil engineer and accepted by the floodplain administrator in
accordance with subsection
17-15-10 K. 4.
   4.   Along non-incised natural watercourses (i.e. sheet flow areas) where no
unusual geology, sinuosity or similar conditions exist, a standard setback
measured from the base flood limits shall be provided at the time of
development. The setback may be reduced by an engineering analysis performed by
an Arizona registered professional civil engineer and accepted by the
floodplain administrator in accordance with subsection
17-15-10 K. 4.
   5.   Standard erosion hazard setbacks may be reduced by an engineering study
performed by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer and accepted by
the floodplain administrator. The reduced setbacks shall not fall below minimum
allowable erosion hazard setbacks unless the study also includes an analysis
performed by an Arizona registered professional geological engineer. The
following table shows the standard and minimum allowable setbacks when no
physical construction is made to prevent erosion hazard:
 
Base flood flow rate (cfs) Standard erosion hazard Minimum allowable erosion
                           setback (feet)          hazard setback (feet)
<500                       25                      15
500 to 1,999               50                      25
2,000 to 4,999             75                      45
5,000 to 9,999             100                     70
10,000 and greater         250                     175
Santa Cruz River           500                     350
L.   Detention and retention requirements
   1.   Any development with a net residential density of three or more units
per acre after subtracting out common areas, or any residential development
larger than one acre that has a density of six units per developed acre, as
well as all proposed commercial and industrial developments shall provide some
method of peak and/or volumetric runoff reduction. The amount of reduction
required shall be as set forth in the latest edition of the Pima county
regional flood control district design standards for stormwater detention and
retention. The peak runoff reduction shall be provided through detention of
storm water and storm water harvesting for irrigation where possible.
   2.   Balanced and critical drainage basins are watersheds that have been
identified by the chief engineer of the Pima county flood control district on a
1987 map as unsuitable for increased development because of the high
probability of increased flooding with development and the potential for
flooding of existing improvements or property. The floodplain administrator
shall maintain this map of critical and balanced basins within the
jurisdictional limits of the town. Drainage basins that have not previously
been identified as unsuitable for additional urban development shall be
considered balanced basins, but upon study by the floodplain administrator, may
be classified as critical basins. Critical and balanced basins may be developed
further only upon the incorporation of adequate detention systems or flood
control facilities, as reviewed and accepted by the floodplain administrator.
These detention systems or flood control facilities shall be incorporated into
any and all future basin-development proposals, regardless of size or land-use
density.
   3.   Structural flood control measures may be proposed in conjunction with,
or in place of detention/retention systems if it can be clearly demonstrated
that such measures will not alter the water and sediment equilibrium of the
affected watercourse, and will mitigate environmental impacts. Structural flood
control measures, such as channelization to a logical conclusion downstream of
the proposed development and/or improvements to existing offsite flood control
systems within the applicable drainage or stream reach, shall be completed in
accordance with plans reviewed and accepted by the floodplain administrator.
   4.   Localized areas lacking sufficient improved or natural receiving waters
into which runoff may be discharged may be required to follow alternative
drainage solutions including complete retention practices as directed by the
town engineer.
   5.   A fee may be collected by the town in lieu of detention/retention
system when it can be clearly demonstrated that the detention at the site does
not provide offsite flood relief due to the parcel size, location within the
drainage basin, or other factors. The fees collected will be used to construct
public flood control improvements that will mitigate the potential damage of
flood waters originating from the property contributing the fees. In balanced
and critical drainage basins, and where development is less than three units
per acre, use of a fee system will be encouraged in lieu of a detention system
to preserve the natural drainage patterns. The fee shall be equivalent to the
cost of a detention system that would otherwise be constructed for the
development to mitigate increased storm water runoff created by the proposed
development.
M.   Access requirements
   1.   Development shall provide all-weather access in accordance with the
following requirements:
      a.   Developments that fall under the requirements of subdivisions of ten
or fewer lots shall provide all-weather access from each lot to the subdivision
entrance. All-weather access shall be constructed from the subdivision entrance
to the nearest paved public roadway. This requirement may be waived if the
following criteria is met:
         i.   Subdivision is characterized as a residential subdivision
         ii.   Subdivision is of a rural character, with minimum lot sizes of
36,000 square feet
         iii.   If, in the determination of the floodplain administrator, it is
not reasonably feasible to construct such access to the subdivision entrance
         iv.   Subsection
17-15-10 M. 2 provisions are utilized.
      b.   All subdivisions that do not fall under the preceding requirements
shall provide all-weather access from each lot to a paved public right of way.
A subdivision with more than one access to a paved public roadway need only
have one all-weather access.
      c.   All commercial developments shall provide all-weather access from a
paved public roadway to all public portions of their site. Nonpublic portions
of a commercial development that are not all-weather access shall be gated and
signs posted in accordance with subsection
17-15-10 M. 2.
      d.   Private residential construction not part of a recorded subdivision
shall construct an all-weather access from the property boundary to a paved
public roadway. If in the determination of the floodplain administrator it is
not reasonably feasible to construct such access to the property, then
subsection
17-15-10 M. 2 provisions may be utilized.
   2.   The floodplain administrator may allow certain exemptions to all-
weather access as stated in the preceding section. A condition of allowing this
exemption is that the owner shall execute and record a covenant running with
the land enforceable by the town which contains the following:
      a.   An acknowledgement that the vehicular access may be impassable to
conventional motor vehicles and emergency vehicles in times of flooding,
      b.   A hold harmless provision, holding the town, its agents, the
floodplain management board harmless from and against all injuries and damages
resulting from the traversing or attempting to traverse the vehicle access
during times of flooding, and
      c.   The covenant, successors and assigns shall erect and maintain a sign
(s) in a location(s) and size(s) acceptable to the town stating “DO NOT ENTER
WHEN FLOODED”

17-15-11 Floodplain variance procedure
A.   Nature of floodplain variances
   1.   Floodplain variances pertain to a piece of property and are not
personal in nature. A floodplain variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
   2.   Floodplain variances from the flood elevation or from other
requirements in this chapter shall be granted only in rare situations. The
long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met
if floodplain variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the floodplain
variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a floodplain variance can be
properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in
which alternatives other than a floodplain variance are more appropriate.
B.   Appeal board
   1.   The floodplain board of the town of Marana shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for floodplain variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
   2.   The floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   3.   In considering applications, the floodplain board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      b.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use,
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      i.   The safety of access to the property and all of its habitable
structures in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
      h.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and,
      k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges.
   4.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 3 and the purposes of
this chapter, the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting
of floodplain variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   5.   Any applicant to whom a floodplain variance is granted shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      a.   The issuance of a floodplain variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
coverage;
      b.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property; and
      c.   The land upon which the floodplain variance is granted shall be
ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land
exchange program provided for by A.R.S. § 37-610. A copy of the notice shall be
recorded in the office of the Pima County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   6.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all floodplain
variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
C.   Conditions for floodplain variances
   1.   Floodplain variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation,
restoration, or floodproofing of structures listed in the national register of
historic places or the state inventory of historic places, upon a determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure and the floodplain variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
   2.   Floodplain variances may be issued for accessory structures used solely
for limited storage that have a size of less than 150 square feet, provided
that the following requirements are met:
      a.   Structure is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement;
      b.   The portions of the structure located below the BFE are constructed
of flood resistant materials;
      c.   The structure is designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters;
      d.   Any mechanical, utility or electrical equipment is elevated or
flood-proofed above the BFE; and
      e.   The structure does not violate any floodway requirements.
   3.   Floodplain variances may be issued for agricultural structures whose
use is exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting, storage,
drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising of
livestock, such as pole and pre-fabricated metal structures, grain bins and
corn cribs provided that the following requirements are met:
      a.   The structure is designed in a manner that results in minimal damage
from flooding;
      b.   The contents stored in the structure will create no additional
threat to the public;
      c.   The structure is designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters;
      d.   Any mechanical, utility or electrical equipment is elevated or
flood-proofed above the BFE; and
      e.   The structure does not violate any floodway requirements.
   4.   Floodplain variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the Base Flood discharge would result.
   5.   Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
floodplain variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.
   6.   Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon:
      a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      b.   A determination that failure to grant the floodplain variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      c.   A showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it
is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only
facilities defined in section
17-15-2 of this chapter in the definition of “functionally dependent use”; and,
      d.   A determination that the granting of a floodplain variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

construction services to, does himself or by or through others, or directly or
indirectly supervises others to:
      a.   Construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move,
wreck or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation or other
structure, project, development or improvement, or to do any part thereof,
including the erection of scaffolding or any other structure or work in
connection with the construction.
      b.   Connect such structure or improvements to utility service lines and
metering devices and the sewer line.
      c.   Provide mechanical or structural service for any such structure or
improvements. A.R.S. § 32-1101 (3).
   7.   CWA, clean water act: The federal water pollution control act, as
amended, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et. seq.
   8.   Developer: Any person, group or entity proposing or constructing a
development as defined by the land development code.
   9.   Discharge: Any pollutant that leaves the site.
   10.   EPA: The United States environmental protection agency charged with
primary enforcement of the clean water act (CWA).
   11.   Final stabilization: means that either:
      a.   All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and
either of the two following criteria are met:
         i.   A uniform (e.g., evenly distributed, without large bare areas)
perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the native background
vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and
areas not covered by permanent structures, or
         ii.   Equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as riprap,
gabions, or geotextiles) have been employed.
      b.   When background native vegetation will cover less than 100% of the
ground (e.g., arid areas, beaches), the 70% coverage criteria is adjusted as
follows: if the native vegetation covers 50% of the ground, 70% of 50% (.70 x
.50 = .35) would require 35% total cover for final stabilization. On a beach
with no natural vegetation, no stabilization is required.
      c.   For individual lots in residential construction final stabilization
means that either:
         i.   The homebuilder has completed final stabilization as specified
above, or
         ii.   The homebuilder has established temporary stabilization
including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the
home by the homeowner and informing the homeowner of the need for, and benefits
of, final stabilization, or
         iii.   For construction projects on land used for agricultural
purposes (e.g., pipelines across crop or range land), final stabilization may
be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction
agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used for
agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to “water
of the United States,” and areas which are not being returned to their
preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteria
above.
   12.   Illicit discharge: Any discharge to a storm drain system that is not
composed entirely of stormwater except discharges pursuant to a AZPDES permit,
discharges resulting from emergency firefighting activities, and discharges
further exempted in subsection
17-16-2 B of this chapter.

determine the level of compliance with statutory requirements and/or pollutant
levels in various media or in humans, plants, and animals.
   14.   MS4, municipal separate storm sewer system: Includes, but is not
limited to, those facilities located within the town and owned or operated by a
public entity by which stormwater may be collected and conveyed to waters of
the United States, including any roads with drainage systems, public streets,
inlets, curbs, gutters, piped storm drains and retention or detention basins.

17-16-3 Compliance monitoring
A.   Inspections
   1.   Authority to inspect. Upon presentation of credentials and at all
reasonable or necessary hours, all authorized employees of the town shall have
access to all premises and to all records pertaining to those premises for
purposes of ensuring compliance with this chapter. Inspection, interviewing,
copying, sampling, photographing, and other activities conducted on the
premises shall be limited to those which are reasonably needed by the town in
determining compliance with the requirements of this chapter. All persons shall
allow such activities under safe and non-hazardous conditions with a minimum of
delay. Inspections of active construction sites will follow the guidelines and
schedules of the AZPDES Phase II MS4 permit issued to the town.
   2.   Monitoring activities. The town may order any person engaged in any
activity or owning or operating on any premises which is causing or
contributing to discharges of pollutants to the municipal storm sewer system in
violation of this chapter or that is posing a risk to public health, safety,
and welfare to undertake such monitoring activities and analyses and furnish
such reports as the town reasonably may specify. The costs of such activities,
analyses, and reports shall be borne in the recipient of the order.
   3.   Access refusal. If an authorized employee of the town has been refused
access to any premises, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to
inspect, interview, copy, photograph or sample as part of an inspection and
sampling procedure of the town designed to determine compliance with the
requirements of this chapter or any related laws or regulations, or to protect
the environment and the public health, safety, and welfare of the community,
then the town may seek issuance of a search warrant from the town municipal
court.
B.   Enforcement and penalties.
   1.   When inspections by town staff reveal deficiencies in the
implementation of the SWPPP, a written inspection report will be provided to
the owner and operator within 30 days of the inspection.
   2.   Charges or penalties levied pursuant to this chapter shall be collected
and utilized for public education and outreach in compliance with the town's
MS4 permit.
   3.   Operator and/or owner of record. The operator performing activities
and/or owner of record of the property upon which a violation of this chapter
occurs shall be presumed to be a person having lawful control over the activity
or premises unless it is demonstrated and documented that another person has
knowingly and in good faith accepted responsibility for the activity at issue.
If more than one person is identified as the owner, such persons shall be
presumed to be jointly and severally in lawful possession and control of the
activity or premises.
   4.   Notice to correct. The town may issue a written notice to correct to
any person who has violated or is in violation of this chapter. Failure to
comply with any act required in the notice to correct may result in a notice of
violation and/or stop work order.
   5.   Notice of violation. The town may issue a written notice of violation
to any person who has violated or is in violation of this chapter. Failure to
comply with any act required in the notice of violation shall be a separate
violation for each day beyond the third calendar day following the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the town to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation. In appropriate situations the town
may notify the person orally either in person or by telephone prior to written
notification.
   6.   Consent orders. The town may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, negotiated settlement agreements, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the
person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document, including an identification and description of the best management
practices and measures to utilize in implementing the order. Such documents
shall have the same force and effect as any other orders issued under this
chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
   7.   Stop work order. For projects under construction in the town, if the
town finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision
of this chapter or any related laws or regulations, or that the person’s past
violations are likely to recur, the town may issue a stop work order to the
person directing them to cease and desist all such violations and direct the
person to immediately comply with all requirements; and take such appropriate
remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing
or threatened violation. Issuance of a stop work order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person. A
person’s failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to this chapter shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
   8.   Civil penalties. A person who violates any requirement of this chapter
shall be civilly liable to the town for a sum not to exceed $2,500 per day for
each violation.
   9.   Criminal penalties. A person who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this chapter, or any related laws or regulations shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be
punished by a fine not to exceed $2,500 per day for each violation and/or by
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months.
   10.   Criminal prosecution. Some intentional violations may constitute
criminal violations of federal, state, and town law, and that under such
circumstances, the town may seek the assistance of the EPA, the state, or the
town prosecutor to commence civil and/or criminal action against any person who
violates any requirement of this chapter.
   11.   The town may withhold the issuance of permits including but not
limited to building permits, native plant permits and grading permits, for the
development or improvement on the parcel or any contiguous parcel of land under
the ownership of a person or persons in violation of any requirement of this
chapter.
   12.   Liability for costs. The town may assess liability for costs to any
person in violation of this chapter for all actual costs incurred by the town
in surveillance, sampling and testing, abatement, and remediation associated
with a discharge. Additionally, the town may assess liability for costs to any
person whose discharge resulted in a violation of the town’s AZPDES stormwater
permit.

17-17-5 Authority for development impact fees
A.   Fee report and implementation. The town may assess and collect a
development impact fee for costs of necessary public services, including all
professional services required for the preparation or revision of an
infrastructure improvements plan, fee report, development impact fee, and
required reports or audits conducted pursuant to this chapter. Development
impact fees shall be subject to the following requirements:
   1.   The town shall develop and adopt a fee report that analyzes and defines
the development impact fees to be charged in each service area for each capital
facility category, based on the infrastructure improvements plan and the plan-
based cost per EDU calculated pursuant to section
17-17-8 A. 13 below.
   2.   Development impact fees shall be assessed against all new commercial,
residential, and industrial developments, provided that the town may assess
different amounts of development impact fees against specific categories of
development based on the actual burdens and costs that are associated with
providing necessary public services to that category of development. No
development impact fee shall exceed the plan-based cost per EDU for any
category of development.
   3.   No development impact fees shall be charged, or credits issued, for any
capital facility that does not fall within one of the categories of necessary
public services for which development impact fees may be assessed as identified
in section
17-17-8 A. 1 below.
   4.   Costs for necessary public services made necessary by new development
shall be based on the same level of service provided to existing development in
the same service area. Development impact fees may not be used to provide a
higher level of service to existing development or to meet stricter safety,
efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory standards to the extent that
these are applied to existing capital facilities that are serving existing
development.
   5.   Development impact fees may not be used to pay the town’s
administrative, maintenance, or other operating costs.
   6.   Projected interest charges and financing costs can only be included in
development impact fees to the extent they represent principal and/or interest
on the portion of any financing or debt used to finance the construction or
expansion of a capital facility identified in the infrastructure improvements
plan.
   7.   Except for any fees included on interim fee schedules, all development
impact fees charged by the town must be included in a “fee schedule” prepared
pursuant to this chapter and included in the fee report.
   8.   All development impact fees shall meet the requirements of A.R.S. § 9-
463.05.
B.   Costs per EDU. The fee report shall summarize the costs of capital
facilities necessary to serve new development on a per EDU basis as defined and
calculated in the infrastructure improvements plan, including all required
offsets, and shall recommend a development impact fee structure for adoption by
the town. The actual impact fees to be assessed shall be disclosed and adopted
in the form of impact fee schedules.
C.   Carry-over of previously-established development impact fees and
grandfathered facilities. Notwithstanding the requirements of this chapter,
certain development impact fees adopted by the town prior to the effective date
of this chapter shall continue in effect as follows:
   1.   The lower Santa Cruz levee fee adopted by Marana ordinance number 99.02
shall remain in effect until the full $1,875,000 indebtedness covered by the
fee is paid.
   2.   The Marana south transportation development impact fee adopted by
Marana ordinance number 2001.02 and modified by Marana ordinance number 2006.12
shall remain in effect until the full Twin Peaks/I-10 Interchange indebtedness
is paid.
   3.   Defined terms in any previously established fee schedule shall be
interpreted according to the ordinance in effect at the time of their adoption.
17-17-6 Administration of development impact fees
A.   Separate accounts. Development impact fees collected pursuant to this
chapter shall be placed in separate, interest-bearing accounts for each capital
facility category within each service area.
B.   Limitations on use of fees. Development impact fees and any interest on
them collected pursuant to this chapter shall be spent to provide capital
facilities associated with the same category of necessary public services in
the same service area for which they were collected, including costs of
financing or debt used by the town to finance those capital facilities and
other costs authorized by this chapter that are included in the infrastructure
improvements plan.
C.   Time limit. Development impact fees collected after July 31, 2014 shall be
used within ten years of the date upon which they were collected for all
categories of necessary public services except for water and wastewater
facilities. For water facilities or wastewater facilities collected after July
31, 2014, development impact fees shall be used within 15 years of the date
upon which they were collected.
17-17-7 Land use assumptions
A.   Consistency. The infrastructure improvements plan shall be consistent with
the town’s current land use assumptions for each service area and each category
of necessary public services as adopted by the town pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-
463.05.
B.   Reviewing the land use assumptions. Prior to the adoption or amendment of
an infrastructure improvements plan, the town shall review and evaluate the
land use assumptions on which the infrastructure improvements plan is to be
based to ensure that the land use assumptions within each service area conform
with the general plan.
C.   Evaluating necessary changes. If the land use assumptions upon which an
infrastructure improvements plan is based have not been updated within the last
five years, the town shall evaluate the land use assumptions to determine
whether changes are necessary. If, after general evaluation, the town
determines that the land use assumptions are still valid, the town shall issue
the report required in section
17-17-10 below.
D.   Required modifications to land use assumptions. If the town determines
that changes to the land use assumptions are necessary in order to adopt or
amend an infrastructure improvements plan, it shall make such changes as
necessary to the land use assumptions prior to or in conjunction with the
review and approval of the infrastructure improvements plan pursuant to section
17-17-10 below.
17-17-8 Infrastructure improvements plan
A.   Infrastructure improvements plan contents. The infrastructure improvements
plan shall be developed by qualified professionals and may be based upon or
incorporated within the town’s capital improvements plan. The infrastructure
improvements plan shall:
   1.   Specify the categories of necessary public services for which the town
will impose a development impact fee, which may include any or all of the
following:
      a.   Water
      b.   Wastewater
      c.   Stormwater, drainage, and flood control
      d.   Street facilities
      e.   Parks
      f.   Police
   2.   Define and provide a map of one or more service areas within which the
town will provide each category of necessary public services for which
development impact fees will be charged. Each service area must be defined in a
manner that demonstrates a substantial nexus between the capital facilities to
be provided in the service area and the EDUs to be served by those capital
facilities. For parks larger than 30 acres, each service area must be defined
in a manner that demonstrates a direct benefit between the capital facilities
and the EDUs to be served by those capital facilities. The town may cover more
than one category of capital facilities in the same service area provided that
there is an independent substantial nexus or direct benefit, as applicable,
between each category of necessary public services and the EDUs to be served.
   3.   Identify and describe the land use assumptions upon which the
infrastructure improvements plan is based in each service area.
   4.   Analyze and identify the existing level of service provided by the town
to existing EDUs for each category of necessary public services in each service
area.
   5.   Identify the level of service to be provided by the town for each
category of necessary public services in each service area based on the
relevant land use assumptions and any established town standards or policies
related to required levels of service. If the town provides the same category
of necessary public services in more than one service area, the infrastructure
improvements plan shall include a comparison of the levels of service to be
provided in each service area.
   6.   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and identify
the existing capacity of the capital facilities in each service area, the
utilization of those capital facilities by existing EDUs, and the available
excess capacity of those capital facilities to serve new EDUs including any
existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage of such capacity.
The infrastructure improvements plan shall additionally identify any changes or
upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned level of service to existing EDUs, or to meet new safety,
efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory requirements for services
provided to existing EDUs.
   7.   Estimate the total number of existing and future EDUs within each
service area based on the town’s land use assumptions and projected new EDUs in
each service area.
   8.   Based on the analysis in subparagraphs
17-17-8A.3 through 6 above, provide a summary table or tables describing the
level of service for each category of necessary public services by relating the
required capital facilities to EDUs in each service area, and identifying the
applicable EDU factor associated with each category of development.
   9.   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and identify
the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing capital
facilities, and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be required to
provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service area as a
result of the new projected EDUs in that service area, for a period not to
exceed ten years. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the town from
additionally including in its infrastructure improvements plan projected
utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer than ten
years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded from the
calculation of the plan-based cost per EDU.
   10.   For each category of necessary public services, estimate the total
cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital facilities
that will be required to serve new EDUs, including costs of land acquisition,
improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to
design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs, as well as
projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include costs for
ongoing operation and maintenance of capital facilities, nor for replacement of
capital facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve
existing EDUs. If the infrastructure improvements plan includes changes or
upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned level of service to existing EDUs, or to meet new
regulatory requirements for services provided to existing EDUs, such costs
shall be identified and distinguished in the infrastructure improvements plan.
   11.   Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other sources
that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities
identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, which shall include
estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad
valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and
the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based
on the approved land use assumptions. The infrastructure improvements plan
shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct and
implement the new or expanded capital facilities.
   12.   Calculate required offsets as follows:
      a.   From the forecasted revenues in subparagraph
17-17-8 A. 11, identify those sources of revenue that: (i) are attributable to
new development, and (ii) will contribute to paying for the capital costs of
necessary public services.
      b.   For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to
subparagraph
17-17-8 A. 12. a, calculate the relative contribution of each category of
development to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services in
each service area.
      c.   Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to
subparagraph
17-17-8 A. 12. b, for each category of necessary public services, calculate the
total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service
area.
      d.   For each category of necessary public services, convert the total
offset to be provided to each category of development in each service area into
an offset amount per EDU by dividing the total offset for each category of
development by the number of EDUs associated with that category of development.
      e.   Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the required
offset, if the town imposes a construction, contracting, or similar excise tax
rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege tax rate
that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax
classifications in the town, the entire excess portion of the construction,
contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the
capital costs of necessary public services provided to new development unless
the excess portion is already utilized for such purpose pursuant to this
section.
      f.   In determining the amount of required offset for land included in a
community facilities district established under A.R.S. title 48, chapter 4,
article 6, the town shall take into account any capital facilities provided by
the district that are included in the infrastructure improvements plan and the
capital costs paid by the district for such capital facilities, and shall
offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district
proportionally.
   13.   Calculate the plan-based cost per EDU by:
      a.   Dividing the total projected costs to provide capital facilities to
new EDUs for each category of necessary public services in each service area as
determined pursuant to subsection
17-17-8 A. 8 above into the number of new EDUs projected for that service area
over a period not to exceed ten years, considering the specific EDU factors
associated with those EDUs for each category of necessary public services.
      b.   Subtracting the required offset per EDU calculated pursuant to
subsection
17-17-8 A. 12 above.
B.   Multiple plans. An infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to
this section may address one or more of the town’s categories of necessary
public services in any or all of the town’s service areas. Each capital
facility shall be subject to no more than one infrastructure improvements plan
at any given time.
C.   Reserved capacity. The town may reserve capacity in an infrastructure
improvements plan to serve one or more planned future developments, including
capacity reserved through a development agreement pursuant to section
17-17-13 below. All reservations of existing capacity must be disclosed in the
infrastructure improvements plan at the time it is adopted.
17-17-9 Adoption and modification procedures
A.   Adopting or amending the infrastructure improvements plan. The
infrastructure improvements plan shall be adopted or amended subject to the
following procedures:
   1.   Major amendments to the infrastructure improvements plan. Except as
provided in subparagraph

plan shall occur at one or more public hearings according to the following
schedule, and may occur concurrently with the adoption of an update of the
town’s land use assumptions as provided in section
17-17-7 above:
      a.   Sixty days before the first public hearing regarding a new or
updated infrastructure improvements plan, the town shall provide public notice
of the hearing and post the infrastructure improvements plan and the underlying
land use assumptions on its website; the town shall additionally make available
to the public the documents used to prepare the infrastructure improvements
plan and underlying land use assumptions and the amount of any proposed changes
to the plan-based cost per EDU.

underlying land use assumptions will not increase the level of service to be
provided in any service area.
      c.   Based on an analysis of the fee report and the town’s adopted
development impact fee schedules, the changes in the infrastructure
improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions would not,
individually or cumulatively with other amendments undertaken pursuant to this
subsection, have caused a development impact fee in any service area to have
been increased by more than 5% above the development impact fee that is
provided in the current development impact fee schedule.
      d.   At least 30 days prior to the date that the amendment pursuant to
this section is adopted, the town shall post the proposed amendments on the
town website.

17-17-11 Collection of development impact fees
A.   Collection. Development impact fees shall be calculated and collected
prior to issuance of permission to commence development; specifically:
   1.   Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement adopted
pursuant to section
17-17-13 below, development impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a
building permit according to the current development impact fee schedule for
the applicable service area as adopted pursuant to this chapter, or according
to any other development impact fee schedule as authorized in this chapter.
   2.   If a building permit is not required for the development, but water or
wastewater connections are required, any and all development impact fees due
shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased. If only a
wastewater connection is required, the development impact fees shall be paid
prior to approval of a connection to the sewer system. Wastewater development
impact fees shall be assessed if a development connects to the public sewer, or
as determined by the town utilities director, is capable of discharging sewage
to a town public sewer.
   3.   If the development is located in a service area with a stormwater,
drainage, and flood control development impact fee, and neither a building
permit, water, or sewer service connection is required, the storm drainage
development impact fee due shall be paid at the time a civil or site permit is
issued for the development.
   4.   No building permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of
occupancy shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed
in the previous paragraphs.
   5.   If the building permit is for a change in the type of building use, an
increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a
residential or non-residential point of demand to the water or wastewater
system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service
units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development
impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type.
   6.   For issued permits that expire or are voided, and the development
impact fees paid for such development have not been refunded, the permittee
shall pay the difference between any development impact fees paid at the time
the permit was issued and those in the fee schedule at the time the permit is
reissued or renewed.
B.   Exceptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either of the
following conditions:
   1.   Development impact fees have been paid for the development and the
permit that triggered the collection of the development impact fees has not
expired or been voided.
   2.   The approval that triggers the collection of development impact fees
involves modifications to existing residential or non-residential development
that do not: (a) add new EDUs, (b) increase the impact of existing EDUs on
existing or future capital facilities, or (c) change the land-use type of the
existing development to a different category of development for which a higher
development impact fee would have been due. To the extent that any modification
does not meet the requirements of this paragraph, the development impact fee
due shall be the difference between the development impact fee that was or
would have been due on the existing development and the development impact fee
that is due on the development as modified.
C.   Temporary exemptions from development impact fee schedules. New
developments in the town shall be temporarily exempt from increases in
development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or modified
development impact fee schedules as follows:
   1.   Residential uses (other than multifamily). On or after the day that the
first building permit is issued for a residential development (other than
multifamily), the town shall, at the permittee’s request, provide the permittee
with an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a
period of 24 months beginning on the day that the first building permit is
issued, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th
month after the first building permit is issued. During the effective period of
the applicable development impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for
the same residential development shall not be subject to any new or modified
development impact fee schedule.
   2.   All other uses. On or after the town’s approval of a development plan
or subdivision plat for a retail, high traffic retail, industrial, general
office, medical facilities, institutional, recreational, or multifamily
development, the town shall provide an applicable development impact fee
schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day
the development plan or subdivision plat was approved, and which shall expire
at the end of the first business day of the 25th month after the development
plan or subdivision plat was approved. During the effective period of the
applicable development impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for the
same development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact
fee schedule.
   3.   Changes to development plans and subdivision plats. During the 24-month
period referred to in subsection
17-17-11 C. 1 or 2 above, if changes are made to a development’s final
development plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service
units, the town may assess any new or modified development impact fees against
the additional service units. If the town reduces the amount of an applicable
development impact fee during the 24-month period referred to in subsection
17-17-11 C. 1 or 2 above, the town shall assess the lower development impact
fee.
D.   Option to pursue special fee determination. Where a development is of a
type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development
appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development
has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated
with providing necessary public services to that development will differ
substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified
category of development, the town may require the applicant to provide the town
engineer with an alternative development impact fee analysis. Based on a
projection of the actual burdens and costs that will be associated with the
development, the alternative development impact fee analysis may propose a
unique fee for the development based on the application of an appropriate EDU
factor to the applicable plan-based cost per EDU, or may propose that the
development be covered under the development impact fee schedule governing a
different and more analogous category of development. The town engineer shall
review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall make a determination as to
the development impact fee to be charged. The decision shall be appealable
pursuant to section
17-17-14 below. The town engineer may require the applicant to pay an
administrative fee to cover the actual costs of reviewing the special fee
determination application.
17-17-12 Development impact fee credits and credit agreements
A.   Eligibility of capital facility. All development impact fee credits must
meet the following requirements:
   1.   One of the following is true:
      a.   The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward a capital
facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit will be
issued, must be identified in an adopted Infrastructure improvements plan and
fee report as a capital facility for which a development impact fee was
assessed; or
      b.   The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town that,
given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility should
have been included in the infrastructure improvements plan in lieu of a
different capital facility that was included in the infrastructure improvements
plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject
capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the
town shall amend the infrastructure improvements plan to (i) include the
subject replacement facility and (ii) delete the capital facility that will be
replaced.
   2.   Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a
developer if the cost of the infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by
the town through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the
developer will be paid or reimbursed by the town for any contribution, payment,
construction, or dedication from any town funding source including an agreement
to reimburse the developer with future collected development impact fees
pursuant to section
17-17-13 below, any credits claimed by the developer shall be (a) deducted from
any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the town or (b) reduced by the amount
of the payment or reimbursement.
B.   Eligibility of subject development. To be eligible for a credit, the
subject development must be located within the service area of the eligible
capital facility.
C.   Calculation of credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the costs
for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted infrastructure
improvements plan for which a development fee was assessed pursuant to the fee
report. If the gross impact fee for a particular category of necessary public
service is adopted at an amount lower than the plan-based cost per EDU, the
amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to the difference between
the plan-based cost per EDU and the gross impact fee adopted. A credit shall
not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in providing the eligible
capital facility.
D.   Allocation of credits. Before credits can be issued to a subject
development (or portion of it), credits must be allocated to that development
as follows:
   1.   The developer and the town must execute a credit agreement including
all of the following:
      a.   The total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an
eligible capital facility.
      b.   The estimated number of EDUs to be served within the subject
development.
      c.   The method by which the credit values will be distributed within the
subject development.
   2.   It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of
development impact fee credits through an application for a credit agreement
(which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to section
17-17-13 below).
   3.   If a building permit is issued or a water/sewer connection is
purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a credit
agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated
retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any
remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this chapter.
   4.   If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or
relinquishes a development (or portion of it) that it owns or controls prior to
execution of a credit agreement or development agreement, credits resulting
from the eligible capital facility will only be allocated to the development if
the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor in
interest for the subject development.
   5.   If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible capital facility, both
entities must enter into a single credit agreement with the town, and any
request for the allocation of credit within the subject development must be
made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible capital facility.
   6.   Credits may only be reallocated from or within a subject development
with the town’s approval of an amendment to an executed credit agreement,
subject to the following conditions:
      a.   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town, or
its legal successor in interest and the entity that currently controls the
subject development are parties to the request for reallocation.
      b.   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any credits
already issued for the subject development.
   7.   A credit agreement may authorize the allocation of credits to a non-
contiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met:
      a.   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town or its
legal successor in interest, the entity that currently controls the subject
development, and the entity that controls the non-contiguous parcel are parties
to the request for reallocation.
      b.   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any credits
already issued for the subject development.
      c.   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that served
by the eligible capital facility.
      d.   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from
the eligible capital facility.
      e.   The credit agreement specifically states the value of the credits to
be allocated to each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a mechanism for future
determination of the value of the credits.
      f.   The credit agreement does not involve the transfer of credits to or
from any property subject to a development agreement.
E.   Credit agreement. Credits shall only be issued pursuant to a credit
agreement that conforms to the requirements set forth in paragraph
17-17-12 D above. The town manager or authorized designee is authorized by this
chapter to enter into a credit agreement with the controlling entity of a
subject development, subject to the following:
   1.   The developer requesting the credit agreement shall provide all
information requested by the town to allow it to determine the value of the
credit to be applied.
   2.   An application for a credit agreement shall be submitted to the town by
the developer within one year of the date on which ownership or control of the
capital facility passes to the town.
   3.   The developer shall submit a draft credit agreement to the town manager
or authorized designee for review in the form provided to the applicant by the
town. The draft credit agreement shall include, at a minimum, all of the
following information and supporting documentation:
      a.   A legal description and map depicting the location of the subject
development for which the credits are being applied. The map shall depict the
location of the capital facilities that have been or will be provided.
      b.   An estimate of the total EDUs that will be developed within the
subject development depicted on the map and described in the legal description.
      c.   A list of the capital facilities, associated physical attributes,
and the related costs as stated in the infrastructure improvements plan.
      d.   Documentation showing the date of acceptance by the town, if the
capital facilities have already been provided.
      e.   The total amount of the credits to be applied within the subject
development and the calculations leading to the total amount of the credits.
      f.   The credits to be applied to each EDU within the subject development
for each category of necessary public services.
   4.   The town’s determination of the credits to be allocated is final.
   5.   Upon execution of the credit agreement by the town and the applicant,
credits shall be deemed allocated to the subject development.
   6.   Any amendment to a previously approved credit agreement must be
initiated within two years of the town’s final acceptance of the eligible
capital facility for which the amendment is requested.
   7.   Any credit agreement approved as part of a development agreement shall
be amended in accordance with the terms of the development agreement and
section
17-17-13 below.
F.   Issuance of credits. Credits allocated pursuant to subparagraph
17-17-12 D above may be issued and applied toward the gross impact fees due
from a development, subject to the following conditions:
   1.   Credits issued for an eligible capital facility may only be applied to
the development impact fee due for the applicable category of necessary public
services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another category of
necessary public services.
   2.   Credits shall only be issued when the eligible capital facility from
which the credits were derived has been accepted by the town or when adequate
security for the completion of the eligible capital facility has been provided
in accordance with all terms of an executed development agreement.
   3.   Where credits have been issued pursuant to subparagraph
17-17-12 F. 2 above, an impact fee due at the time a building permit is issued
shall be reduced by the credits stated in or calculated from the executed
credit agreement. Where credits have not yet been issued, the gross impact fee
shall be paid in full, and a refund of the credits shall be due when the
developer demonstrates compliance with subparagraph
17-17-12 F. 2 above in a written request to the town.
   4.   Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to another
permit or parcel, except that credits may be released for reuse on the same
subject development if a building permit for which the credits were issued has
expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a refund under
subparagraph
17-17-15 A. 2. a.
   5.   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section
17-17-12, credits issued prior to January 1, 2012 may only be used for the
subject development for which they were issued. The credits may be transferred
to a new owner of all or part of the subject development in proportion to the
percentage of ownership in the subject development to be held by the new owner.
17-17-13 Development agreements
A.   General. Development agreements containing provisions regarding
development impact fees, development impact fee credits, and/or disbursement of
revenues from development impact fee accounts shall comply with the
requirements of this section.
B.   Development agreement required. A development agreement is required to
authorize any of the following:
   1.   To issue credits prior to the town’s acceptance of an eligible capital
facility.
   2.   To allocate credits to a parcel that is not contiguous with the subject
development and that does not meet the requirements of subparagraph
17-17-12 D. 7 above.
   3.   To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using funds
from development impact fee accounts.
   4.   To allocate different credit amounts per EDU to different parcels
within a subject development.
   5.   For a single family residential dwelling unit, to allow development
impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit
as provided in subparagraph
17-17-13 H below.
C.   General requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared and
executed in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and any applicable requirements
of the town code. Except where specifically modified by this section, all
provisions of section
17-17-12 shall apply to any credit agreement that is authorized as part of a
development agreement.
D.   Early issuance of credits. A development agreement may authorize the
issuance of credits prior to acceptance of an eligible capital facility by the
town when the development agreement specifically states the form and value of
the security (i.e. bond, letter of credit, etc.) to be provided to the town
prior to issuance of any credits. The town shall determine the acceptable form
and value of the security to be provided.
E.   Non-contiguous allocation of credits. A development agreement may
authorize the allocation of credits to a non-contiguous parcel only if all of
the following conditions are met:
   1.   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that served by
the eligible capital facility.
   2.   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from the
eligible capital facility.
   3.   The development agreement specifically states the value of the credits
to be allocated to each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a mechanism for
future determination of the credits.
F.   Uneven allocation of credits. The development agreement must specify how
credits will be allocated amongst different parcels on a per-EDU basis, if the
credits are not to be allocated evenly. If the development agreement is silent
on this topic, all credits will be allocated evenly amongst all parcels on a
per-EDU basis.
G.   Use of reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from impact fee
accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be utilized in
accordance with applicable law for the use of town funds in construction or
acquisition of capital facilities, including A.R.S. § 34-201, et seq.
H.   Deferral of fees. A development agreement may provide for the deferral of
payment of development impact fees for a residential development beyond the
issuance of a building permit; provided that a development impact fee may not
be paid later than 15 days after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
for that dwelling unit. The development agreement shall provide for the value
of any deferred development impact fees to be supported by appropriate
security, including a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash bond.
I.   Waiver of fees. If the town agrees to waive any development impact fees
assessed on development in a development agreement, the town shall reimburse
the appropriate development impact fee account for the amount that was waived.
J.   No obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the town to enter into
any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit agreement
permitted by this section.
17-17-14 Appeals
A.   General. A development impact fee determination by town staff may be
appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
B.   Limited scope. An appeal shall be limited to disputes regarding the
calculation of the development impact fees for a specific development and/or
permit and calculation of EDU’s for the development.
C.   Form of appeal. An appeal shall be initiated in a format prescribed by the
town, and shall be submitted to the town engineer.
D.   Department action. The town engineer shall act upon the appeal within 30
calendar days of the filing of the appeal, and the applicant shall be notified
of the town engineer’s decision in writing.
E.   Appeal to council.   The applicant may appeal the decision of the town
engineer to the council by submitting an appeal to the town clerk within 14
calendar days of the town engineer’s written decision.
F.   Action by council. The council shall hear and act upon the appeal within
45 calendar days of receipt of the appeal, and the applicant shall be notified
of the council’s decision in writing.
G.   Final decision. The council’s decision regarding the appeal is final.
H.   Fees during pendency. Building permits may be issued during the pendency
of an appeal if the applicant (1) pays the full impact fee calculated by the
town at the time the appeal is filed or (2) provides the town with financial
assurances in the form acceptable to the town manager or authorized designee
equal to the full amount of the impact fee. Upon final disposition of an
appeal, the fee shall be adjusted in accordance with the decision rendered, and
a refund paid if warranted. If the appeal is denied by the council, and the
applicant has provided the town with financial assurances as set forth in
clause (2) above, the applicant shall deliver the full amount of the impact fee
to the town within ten days of the council’s final decision on the appeal. If
the applicant fails to deliver the full amount of the impact fees when required
by this subsection, the town may draw upon such financial assurance instruments
as necessary to recover the full amount of the impact fees due from the
applicant.
17-17-15 Refunds of development impact fees
A.   Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current owner of
property within the town who submits a written request to the town and
demonstrates that:
   1.   The permit that triggered the collection of the development impact fee
has expired or been voided prior to the commencement of the development for
which the permit was issued and the development impact fees collected have not
been expended, encumbered, or pledged for the repayment of financing or debt;
or
   2.   The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in interest
paid a development impact fee for the applicable capital facility on or after
August 1, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists:
      a.   The capital facility designed to serve the subject real property has
been constructed, has the capacity to serve the subject real property and any
development for which there is reserved capacity, and the service which was to
be provided by that capital facility has not been provided to the subject real
property from that capital facility or from any other infrastructure.
      b.   After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility the town
fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time period
identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, as it may be amended, and
the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject real property
from that capital facility or any other infrastructure.
      c.   For a category of necessary public services other than water or
wastewater facilities, any part of a development impact fee is not spent within
ten years of the town’s receipt of the development impact fee.
      d.   Any part of a development impact fee for water or wastewater
facilities is not spent within 15 years of the town’s receipt of the
development impact fee.
      e.   The development impact fee was calculated and collected for the
construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital facility
serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the
capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the
infrastructure improvements plan by a factor of 10% or more. In such event, the
current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request as set forth in
this section, be entitled to a refund for the difference between the amounts of
the development impact fee charged for and attributable to such construction
cost and the amount the development impact fee would have been calculated to be
if the actual construction cost had been included in the fee report. The refund
contemplated by this subsection shall relate only to the costs specific to the
construction of the applicable capital facility and shall not include any
related design, administrative, or other costs not directly incurred for
construction of the capital facility that are included in the development
impact fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
B.   Earned interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include any
interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development impact fee
by the town from the date of collection to the date of refund. All refunds
shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is
paid.
C.   Refund to government. If a development impact fee was paid by a
governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity.
17-17-16 Oversight of development impact fee program
A.   Annual report. Within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year, the town
shall file with the town clerk an unaudited annual report accounting for the
collection and use of the fees for each service area and shall post the report
on its website in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05 (N) and (O), as amended.
B.   Biennial audit. In addition to the annual report described in paragraph A
of this section, the town shall provide for a biennial, certified audit of the
town’s land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development
impact fees.
   1.   An audit pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted by one or more
qualified professionals who are not employees or officials of the town and who
did not prepare the infrastructure improvements plan.
   2.   The audit shall review the collection and expenditures of development
fees for each project in the plan and provide written comments describing the
amount of development impact fees assessed, collected, and spent on capital
facilities.
   3.   The audit shall describe the level of service in each service area, and
evaluate any inequities in implementing the infrastructure improvements plan or
imposing the development impact fee.
   4.   The town shall post the findings of the audit on the town’s website and
shall conduct a public hearing on the audit within 60 days of the release of
the audit to the public.
   5.   For purposes of this section a certified audit shall mean any audit
authenticated by one or more of the qualified professionals conducting the
audit pursuant to subparagraph
17-17-16 B. 1 above.

practicable. The town may not approve any “pop-out” screen boxes unless the
design is architecturally consistent with the original support structure. The
town may not approve any exposed facade-mounted antennas, which includes
exposed antennas painted to match the facade.
   3.   Rooftop-mounted equipment. The town may approve unscreened rooftop
transmission equipment only when it expressly includes a condition of approval
that the equipment is effectively concealed due to its low height and setback
from the roofline.
   4.   Ground-mounted equipment. Outdoor ground-mounted equipment associated
with base stations must be avoided whenever feasible. In locations visible or
accessible to the public, applicants must conceal outdoor ground-mounted
equipment with opaque fences or landscape features that mimic the adjacent
structure(s), including, but not limited to, dumpster corrals and other
accessory structures.

17-18-9 Required findings for approval
A.   Conditional use permit. The planning commission may grant a conditional
use permit for a new wireless facility or a substantial change to an existing
wireless facility only when the planning commission makes all the findings
required by section
17-3-2 of this code, as well as the following additional findings.
   1.   The proposed use is deemed essential or desirable to the public
convenience or welfare.
   2.   The total area of the site and the setbacks of all facilities from
property and street lines are of sufficient magnitude in view of the character
of the land and of the proposed development that significant detrimental impact
on surrounding properties is avoided.
   3.   The appearance of the developed site in terms of the arrangement,
height, scale and architectural style of the buildings, location of parking
areas, landscaping and other features is compatible with the character of the
area.
   4.   The applicant demonstrated that it proposed the least intrusive means
to achieve its technical objectives.
B.   Administrative wireless facilities permit. The planning manager may grant
an administrative wireless facilities permit for a new wireless facility or a
substantial change to an existing wireless facility when the planning manager
finds all of the following:
   1.   The proposed design qualifies as a design subject to administrative
approval as set forth in this chapter.
   2.   The proposed location qualifies as a location subject to administrative
approval as set forth in this chapter.
   3.   The proposal conforms to all applicable design standards set forth in
this this chapter.
   4.   The proposed project will not require any exemption pursuant to section
17-18-16 of this chapter.
C.   Section 6409(a) permit.
   1.   Findings for approval. The planning manager may approve a section 6409
(a) modification when the planning manager finds that the proposed collocation
or modification qualifies as an eligible facilities request and does not cause
a substantial change.
   2.   Grounds for denial. In addition to any other alternative recourse
permitted under federal law, the planning manager may deny a section 6409(a)
permit when the planning manager finds that the proposed collocation or
modification:
      a.   Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition
reasonably related to public health and safety; or
      b.   Involves a structure constructed or modified without all regulatory
approvals required at the time of the construction or modification; or
      c.   Involves the replacement of the entire support structure; or
      d.   Does not qualify for mandatory approval under section 6409(a) for
any lawful reason.
   3.   Any denial of a section 6409(a) permit application shall be without
prejudice to the applicant, the real property owner, or the project. Subject to
the application and submittal requirements in this chapter, the applicant may
immediately resubmit a permit application for a conditional use permit, an
administrative wireless facilities permit, or a section 6409(a) permit as
appropriate.

emergency as determined by the town, when all contact information for
responsible parties shall be immediately provided to the planning manager upon
verbal request.
E.   Indemnities. The permittee and, if applicable, the non-government owner of
the private property upon which the facility is located shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the town, its agents, officers, officials, and employees (i)
from any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and expenses,
and from any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, writs of mandamus, and other
actions or proceedings brought against the town or its agents, officers,
officials, or employees to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void,
or annul the town’s approval of the permit, and (ii) from any and all damages,
liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and expenses, and any and all claims,
demands, lawsuits, or causes of action and other actions or proceedings of any
kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, arising
out of or in connection with the activities or performance of the permittee or,
if applicable, the private property owner or any of each one’s agents,
employees, licensees, contractors, subcontractors, or independent contractors.
If the town becomes aware of any such actions or claims, the town shall
promptly notify the permittee and the private property owner and shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense. It is expressly agreed that the town shall
have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
the legal counsel providing the town’s defense, and the property owner and/or
permittee (as applicable) shall reimburse the town for any costs and expenses
directly and necessarily incurred by the town in the course of the defense.
F.   Interference with public safety radio services. If the town finds reason
to believe that permittee’s radio communications operations are causing

L.   Section 6409(a) modifications. In addition to all applicable standard
conditions of approval required under this section, any section 6409(a) permit
granted by the planning manager or deemed granted by the operation of law
includes the following conditions of approval:
   1.   No permit term extension. The town’s grant or grant by operation of law
of a section 6409(a) permit constitutes a federally-mandated modification to
the underlying permit or approval for the subject tower or base station. The
town’s grant or grant by operation of law of a section 6409(a) permit will not
extend the permit term for any conditional use permit, administrative wireless
facilities permit, or other underlying regulatory approval and its term shall
be coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the
subject tower or base station.
   2.   Accelerated permit terms due to invalidation. If any court of competent
jurisdiction invalidates any portion of section 6409(a) or any FCC rule that
interprets section 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate approval for
any section 6409(a) modification, the permit or permits issued in connection
with a section 6409(a) modification(s) shall automatically expire one year from
the effective date of the judicial order. A permittee shall be required to
remove its improvements approved under the invalidated section 6409(a) permit
unless it has submitted an application for either a conditional use permit or
an administrative wireless facilities permit for those improvements before the
one-year period ends. The planning manager may extend the expiration date on
the accelerated permit upon a written request from the permittee that shows
good cause for an extension.
   3.   No waiver of standing. The town’s grant or grant by operation of law of
a section 6409(a) modification does not waive, and shall not be construed to
waive, any standing by the town to challenge section 6409(a), any FCC rules
that interpret section 6409(a), or any section 6409(a) modification.

entity may file a written appeal to the council to reverse the planning
manager’s final decision to approve or deny without prejudice a section 6409(a)
permit application. The appeal must state in plain terms the grounds for
reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The appellant must pay a fee
in an amount established by a fee schedule adopted by the council and amended
from time to time at the time the appeal is filed. The council shall review the

A.   A permit granted under this chapter may be revoked for noncompliance with
any enforceable permit, permit condition, or law applicable to the facility.
B.   When the planning manager finds reason to believe that grounds for permit
revocation exist, the planning manager shall send written notice by certified
U.S. mail, return receipt requested, to the permittee at the permittee’s last
known address that states the nature of the noncompliance as grounds for permit
revocation. The permittee shall have a reasonable time from the date of the
notice to cure the noncompliance or show that no noncompliance ever occurred.
C.   If the permittee fails to cure any noncompliance after notice and
opportunity to dispute or cure the noncompliance, the council shall conduct a
noticed public hearing to determine whether to revoke the permit. The permittee
shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and may speak and submit written
materials to the council. After the noticed public hearing, the council may
deny the revocation or revoke the permit when it finds that the permittee had
notice of the noncompliance and a reasonable opportunity to cure the
noncompliance, but failed to comply with any enforceable permit, permit
condition, or law applicable to the facility. Written notice of the council’s
determination and the reasons for it shall be dispatched by certified U.S.
mail, return receipt requested, to the permittee’s last known address.
D.   Upon revocation, the council may take any legally permissible action or
combination of actions necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare.

or any part of it, and may use, sell or otherwise dispose of it in any manner
the town deems appropriate.
   2.   The last-known permittee or its successor-in-interest and, if on
private property, the real property owner shall be jointly liable for all costs
incurred by the town in connection with its removal, restoration, repair and
storage, and shall promptly reimburse the town upon receipt of a written
demand, including any interest on the balance owing at the maximum lawful rate.
   3.   The town may, but shall not be obligated to, use any financial security
required in connection with the granting of the facility permit to recover its
costs and interest.
   4.   Until the costs are paid in full, a lien shall be placed on the
facility, all related personal property in connection with the facility and, if
applicable, the real private property on which the facility was located for the
full amount of all costs for removal, restoration, repair and storage. The town

B.   This chapter further seeks to encourage and promote commercial development
which is oriented to serve the adjacent neighborhoods. This overlay district is
intended to provide for specific uses in a planned commercial setting which
will be compatible with, and complimentary to, adjacent uses including nearby
residential neighborhoods. The overlay district will promote a high level of
architectural and landscaping excellence. More specifically, the creation of
this special district shall be encouraged through a coordinated set of design
principles for site planning, structures, architecture, landscaping, and
signage. These principles are intended to guide development activity in a
manner that results in compatibility in terms of land use, site design, and
aesthetics.
C.   No land use or development within the Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay
District boundaries, subject to these regulations, shall commence or be
approved except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. This
chapter shall regulate all land use and development within the overlay district
and shall supplement the provisions of the underlying zoning district and the
applicable specific plan(s) that comprise the area.
D.   The Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District provides for a variety of
uses such as multi-family residential, offices, commercial retail and
commercial services on undeveloped and previously developed commercial
property. Compatibility with existing land uses is intended for new
development.
17-19-2 Applicability
A.   The regulations for the Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District shall
apply to all commercial and multi-family developments within the district and
to any property within the district subsequently changed to a commercial or
high density residential land use designation as a result of rezoning or a
specific plan amendment. This chapter applies to any commercial land, parcel,
lot or project site lying adjacent to Silverbell Road between Cortaro Road and
Twin Peaks Road. These regulations shall also apply to any commercial or multi-
family residential project site contiguous to any applicable land, parcel, lot
or project site adjacent to Silverbell Road.
B.   The regulations of this title shall apply to the area known as the
Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District, the boundaries of which are shown on
exhibit 1 to this chapter, and on the town of Marana zoning map.
17-19-3 Interpretation; scope of regulations
A.   The regulations set forth by this title shall be minimum regulations for
new or proposed commercial or multiple family developments and shall apply
uniformly to each class of use, structure or land, except as otherwise provided
in this chapter.
B.   For building and development occurring subsequent to the enactment of this
chapter, no building structure or land shall be used or occupied and no
building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with all of
the regulations of this chapter. These regulations shall not apply to
properties for which development approval has been obtained prior to the
effective date of this chapter.
17-19-4 Definitions
Certain words used in this chapter shall be interpreted as defined within this
section or as defined in
chapter 17-1 (title, intent, purpose and definitions).
A.   Abutting: The condition of two adjoining properties having a common
property line or boundary, including cases where two or more lots adjoin only
corner or corners, but not including cases where adjoining lots are separated
by a street or alley. (Also see adjacent/adjoining; contiguous).
B.   Adjacent/Adjoining: The condition of being near to or close to but not
necessarily having a common dividing line, i.e., two properties which are
separated only by a street or alley shall be considered as adjacent to each
other. (Also, see abutting; contiguous).
C.   Compatible: Capable of existing together in harmony and without conflict
or ill effects.
D.   Contiguous: Next to, abutting, or touching and having a boundary, or
portion thereof which is common or coterminous, as distinguished from being
adjacent. (Also see abutting; adjacent/ adjoining.)
17-19-5 Effect of other provisions
These provisions are intended to supplement the requirements of the underlying
zoning district or specific plan. If any provision of this chapter is found to
be in conflict with any other provision of this code or with any provision of
the Continental Ranch Specific Plan, Pima Farms Specific Plan or Pima Farms
North Specific Plan, the provision that establishes the higher and/or more
restrictive standard shall prevail.
17-19-6 Design review overlay district
A.   Purpose. To guide the general appearance of buildings and improvements and
achieve the stated objectives of the Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District.
The Design Review (DR) Overlay District is superimposed over the Silverbell
Road Corridor Overlay District.
B.   Applicability. The Design Review (DR) Overlay District includes the entire
Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District. Such development includes, but is
not limited to, new commercial, institutional, office, multi-family residential
projects, proposed conversions, exterior remodeling, exterior restoration,
enlargement or expansion of existing buildings, and requires the submittal of a
design review plan pursuant to this chapter. The development or modification of
an individual single family detached dwelling on a single parcel is
specifically excluded from the requirements of the Design Review Overlay
District.
C.   Standards. No new land use or development within the boundaries of the
Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District shall commence or be approved except
in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
17-19-7 Design guidelines, objectives and considerations
Town staff will review all design review applications and evaluate each
application for compliance with standards that address the following items.
A.   Site design considerations: How the site design impacts adjacent
residences and neighborhoods, sensitive lands, viewsheds, adjacent streets,
pedestrian needs, and parking lot function and safety.
   1.   Compatibility. Examine the functional relationship of the site to its
surroundings. Protection of adjacent residential neighborhoods is the Town's
primary concern. Particular attention should be given to the location of
parking, driveways, outdoor lighting, outdoor use areas and compatibility of
uses. Adjoining residential areas should be protected by maintaining a
landscape buffer edge and directing building openings away from residential
areas.
   2.   Traffic patterns. Evaluate the separation or integration of vehicular,
pedestrian and bicycle traffic patterns. The development of land in cooperation
with owners of adjoining properties is encouraged where parking, driveways,
plazas and entries can be shared. Pedestrian and vehicular safety should be
maximized by carefully siting and limiting the number of driveways.
   3.   Off-street parking. Evaluate the arrangement and adequacy of off-street
parking facilities and access points. Parking should be safe, easily accessible
and not allowed to dominate the entire development. Plant materials should
accent and define entries. Large paved areas should be scaled down by
introducing different materials. Whenever possible, parking should be located
to the rear or side of buildings to provide screening and a strong
architectural street edge. Paving materials should be compatible with other on-
site materials. Additional specialty paving materials such as tile, brick and
exposed aggregate should be introduced where appropriate.
   4.   Loading areas. The location, arrangement, and dimensions of loading
ramps, docks and bays should minimize visual and noise impacts on adjacent
residential areas; and,
   5.   The location and screening of trash receptacles. Careful screening of
undesirable elements such as loading, trash receptacles, mechanical equipment,
etc., is critical.
   6.   The illumination plans and hours of operation.
   7.   Circulation visibility. Evaluate the site distance requirements of the
streets and driveways. Adequate site distance for motorists and pedestrians
entering and exiting the site must be ensured. Landscaping should not interfere
with circulation effectiveness.
   8.   The coordination of the site development with the planned right-of-way
alignments, acquisitions and street improvements.
   9.   Urban design and aesthetic considerations.
   10.   Solar considerations. Trees and architectural features such as
overhangs, trellises and awnings are encouraged to provide shade from the
summer sun.
   11.   Any sensitive lands located on the property or possibly affected by
the proposed development must be avoided, mitigated or otherwise resolved per
town, county, state or federal requirements and recommendations.
B.   Site landscaping and buffering. The site landscaping should provide a
highly attractive landscaping that buffers unwanted views and sound, creates an
interesting streetscape, and provides a safe transition between contrasting
uses.
   1.   Evaluate the location, height, and materials of walls, fences and
screen plantings. Selection of plant materials should be based on year-round
interest, color, branching pattern, etc. Parking lots should be broken up with
landscaped buffers. Trees should provide a lush overhead canopy for solar
control. The overall effect of both the perimeter landscaping and the interior
landscaping should be one of a relatively consistent tree cover which will
shade the pavement and vehicles.
   2.   Evaluate plans for the on-going maintenance of the finished
landscaping.
   3.   Evaluate plans for safe sound and site buffers in consideration of the
preservation of adjoining residential neighborhoods relative to view sheds,
ambient noise levels, light and air, both on the site and on adjacent property.
Earth berming, fences or dense landscaping should be used at the perimeter of
the parking areas to provide for visual enclosure and screening.
   4.   The design and utilization of open spaces and trails, if applicable.
C.   Site grading and drainage: The on-site grading and drainage shall provide
slope and soil stabilization, prevent soil erosion, and minimize off-site
impact.
   1.   Evaluate plans for soil removal, fill work, soil stabilization, and
erosion control.
   2.   Evaluate plans for plantings, ground covers, or shrubbery as a means to
prevent dust, stabilize soils and control erosion.
D.   Signage: Commercial signage should provide business identification,
minimize clutter and confusion and comply with the provisions of this chapter
and
chapter 17-10 (signs).
   1.   Evaluate the size, location, lighting, and hours of operation of all
signs and advertising features to achieve compliance with this chapter. Signage
plans for the entire site should indicate how signs will be illuminated, their
design and spatial relationship to other site amenities, including buildings.
Signage, window designs and awnings are most effective when color coordinated
with the building facade. Darker, deeper and brighter colors on these elements
create interest on the facade and call attention to windows and doorways.
   2.   Evaluate the function and maintenance aspects of signs and other
advertising features.
E.   Utilities. Utility systems should not detract from building or site
appearance. The size and location of all service systems should be appropriate
and maintainable.
   1.   Electrical and telephone service systems shall be underground; and,
   2.   Transformers and pad-mounted mechanical and electrical equipment shall
be screened.
F.   Building design considerations. The commercial design standards defined in
chapter 17-8 (multi-family, commercial, and industrial design standards) shall
be used in conjunction with the following building design considerations.
   1.   Building mass. Evaluate the building mass and its relationship to
surrounding development and its proposed use. The relationship to the
surrounding uses shall be considered in respect to the scale and massing of the
proposed uses.
   2.   Proportion of building. Evaluate the height to width relationship of
new structures for compatibility with the proposed use.
   3.   Building openings. Evaluate openings. They should provide interest
through the use of such features as balconies, bays, porches, covered entries,
overhead structures, awnings, changes in building facade and roofline
alignment.
   4.   Relationship of exterior materials. Evaluate the appropriateness of
exterior materials and color to reduce apparent building mass and blend with
the surrounding area. Exterior building materials should be genuine and not
simulated. Shadow patterns created by architectural elements such as overhangs,
trellises, projections and awnings are encouraged to contribute to a building's
character while aiding climate control.
   5.   Building color. Building color should be compatible with the
neighborhood and should reinforce the visual character of the proposed
building. Warm muted shades should be used as the body or overall building
background color. Brighter, more intense and richer hues of related or
contrasting color should be used as accent colors and highlight colors for
architectural elements.
   6.   Building elevations. Building elevation treatments should be carried to
all sides of the building. Building construction and design shall be used to
create a structure with substantially equal attractive sides of high quality,
rather than placing emphasis on the front elevation of the structure and
neglecting or downgrading the aesthetic appeal of the side and rear elevations.
The character of the surrounding residential development should be incorporated
into the architectural design and materials. Production designs common to fast
food restaurants, convenience markets, etc., are strongly discouraged.
   7.   Roofline. Rooflines of buildings on adjacent properties should be
considered in the design to avoid clashes in style and materials. All roof
materials and colors should complement the primary building material and color.
   8.   Accessory buildings. Accessory structures and additions should utilize
the same materials and design as the primary structure.
   9.   Evaluate compliance of architectural design with the requirements of
the appropriate specific plan, when applicable.

17-19-13 Development standards
The following standards shall apply to all developments within the Silverbell
Road Corridor Overlay District:
A.   General development standards.
   1.   All development proposed within the district shall comply with
chapter 17-8 (multi-family, commercial, and industrial design standards).
   2.   Commercial lots adjacent to a residential district shall require a 25
foot landscape buffer in the side and rear yards adjacent to or facing the
residential area. Such buffers shall not be used for the purpose of parking,
loading, servicing or any other activity. Screening shall consist of decorative
screening walls or landscaping combination that will provide a barrier of
adequate height at the time of installation.
B.   Landscaping. The intent of the landscaping requirements is to provide
corridor residents and businesses with highly attractive landscaping that
buffers unwanted views, creates an interesting streetscape, and provides a safe
and effective transition between potentially incompatible land uses. In
addition, these requirements regulate the protection of native vegetation as a
significant natural resource. All development within the Silverbell Road
Corridor Overlay District shall provide site landscaping including buffer
yards, parking lot landscaping and screening as required in this chapter and in
accordance with
chapters 17-11 (environmental resource preservation, native plant protection,
and landscape requirements) and
17-8 (multi-family, commercial, and industrial design standards).
C.   Off-street parking and loading. The number, size and design of all parking
spaces, driveways and loading areas for all development within the Silverbell
Road Corridor Overlay District shall comply with the applicable specific plan
or the provisions of
chapter 17-9 (parking) and the following requirements:

standards. Joint driveways are desirable whenever possible in order to minimize
the number of access points to streets.
   2.   All parking shall be off-street in paved, landscaped parking areas.
   3.   No parking or maneuvering space is permitted within any required
landscape buffer.
   4.   Loading or service areas shall not be located adjacent to residential
areas.
D.   Signs. Sign standards are hereby established to promote a high quality
visual appearance throughout the Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District; to
allow individual businesses to clearly identify themselves and the goods and
services offered; to create a unique environment to attract visitors; to
safeguard and enhance property values; to reduce potential hazards to motorists
and pedestrians; and to eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays. All
signs for developments within the Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District
shall comply with the provisions of
chapter 17-10 (signs).
   1.   Freestanding signs shall be limited to double-faced, ground-mounted
monument style, with proper landscaping. Freestanding pole signs are
prohibited.
E.   Screening. To create an attractive environment and visually screen land
uses that are not fully compatible, the following standards shall apply to all
development within the Silverbell Road Corridor Overlay District:
   1.   All service entrances and loading areas must be screened from adjacent
properties, and view from adjacent public streets. Such screening shall consist
of decorative walls and or landscaping combination that will provide a barrier
of adequate height at the time of installation.
   2.   All refuse containers and trash handling areas shall be enclosed and
screened from public view. All screening devices shall be constructed of
materials and colors compatible with those of the primary building(s). Chain
link fencing (with or without slats) is not allowed.
   3.   No articles, materials, trash, debris, equipment or inoperable vehicles
shall be stored or kept in the open or exposed to view from the adjacent
streets, sidewalks, or adjacent properties. This limitation does not apply to
temporary storage of materials, equipment and supplies needed for the
construction of improvements on a site, provided such items are completely
removed immediately upon completion of each phase of construction.
   4.   All equipment, such as but not limited to, mechanical, electrical,
communications and air conditioning shall be selected and located in a manner
consistent with the architecture of the project and shall be screened from view
from adjacent properties and public streets. Parapet walls, enclosing walls,
louvers and grills shall be used to conceal from view all equipment on site or
on the roofs of buildings. Exceptions may be made for equipment that, by nature
of simple geometric shape, blends well with the architecture of the project.
Satellite dishes and other communications equipment must be integrated with the
architecture or screened in an acceptable manner.
   5.   All utilities including electric power, telephone, gas and water shall
be located underground. Utilities shall be coordinated with landscape plans to
ensure proper screening and landscaping around utility vaults, box
transformers, etc.
F.   Lighting. Exterior lighting should be designed as part of the
architectural and landscape themes. Site lighting should serve functional,
safety and aesthetic purposes. Site and security lighting shall be designed to
enhance the quality of the development. Screening of lights from residential
areas and glare from traffic areas shall be required. All site lighting shall
be in compliance with the adopted Marana outdoor lighting code.
G.   Design standards. To maintain a high level of architectural quality of
buildings and structures, all new development within the Silverbell Road
Corridor Overlay District shall comply with the standards herein, as well as
the commercial design standards defined in
chapter 17-8 (multi-family, commercial, and industrial design standards).
   1.   Building design should reflect traditional or contemporary variations
of southwestern architecture and should reflect an individual style. Reliance
on or the use of standardized "corporate or franchise" style is discouraged.
   2.   High-quality construction and materials should be used to ensure that
the aesthetic quality of buildings will not diminish over time. Building design
must be consistent in material usage and detail on all elevations. Exterior
materials that may be utilized in various aspects of the building design
includes brick masonry, natural stone masonry, concrete (with an approved
architectural finish), glass (use of highly reflective coating may be limited),
plaster, stucco, wood and cultured stone.
   3.   No masonite, visible asphaltic exterior material, aluminum or steel
siding, non-architectural sheet metal or other similar materials shall be used
on any building except as a trim material, as approved.
   4.   Materials for roofs, eaves and canopies may include tile, fireproof
faux wood shakes or metal with standing rib seams.
   5.   Deep eaves, overhangs, canopies and other architectural features that
provide shelter from the elements and shade in the summer shall be incorporated
into the building design where feasible.
   6.   Roof-top heating and air conditioning equipment and similar features
shall be painted so as to be non-reflective and shall be screened from view.
