all existing or proposed structures within the district.
      (1)   No building or demolition permit application for the Historic
District shall be granted by the municipality until the Historic District
Advisory Commission has had the opportunity to review the permit application.
However, this review shall occur within 30 days of the date of the building or
demolition permit application, or a favorable recommendation shall be deemed to
have been given to the application. In considering the application, the
Advisory Commission shall consider the purpose of the proposal, the
architectural features of the proposal, the architectural character of
structures in the immediate vicinity, the views from the site of the proposal,
the height of existing structures, the prevailing setbacks, the proportion of
the structure and surrounding structures in the immediate vicinity, the rhythm
of these structures, the site utilization present in the immediate vicinity and
other criteria which the Commission considers relevant.
      (2)   After reviewing the application for a building or demolition
permit, the Advisory Commission may accept, reject or accept with conditions,
the proposal. If the Commission accepts the application, the building or
demolition permit may be issued if all other municipal requirements have been
met.
      (3)   If the Commission rejects the application, the building or
demolition permit shall not be issued. The Commission shall forward to the
applicant and to the Town Manager a letter stating that the application has
been rejected.
      (4)   If an application for a building or demolition permit is rejected
by the Commission, the applicant may appeal this decision to the Council. If

         (c)   Prior to this Council meeting, both the applicant for a building
or demolition permit and a representative of the Advisory Commission shall
prepare statements outlining their positions concerning the issue. These
statements shall be supplied to the Council prior to its meeting.
         (d)   Upon receipt of these statements, the Council shall uphold,
modify or reverse the decision of the Historic District Advisory Commission. It
shall also direct the Town Manager concerning the issuance of a building or
demolition permit.
      (5)   If the Historic District Advisory Commission accepts with
conditions an application for either a building or demolition permit within a
historic district, the applicant may either accept these conditions or may
appeal them to the Council using the procedure described above. If the
applicant accepts the conditions, these conditions shall become a part of the
building or demolition permit application.
      (6)   The duties of the Historic District Advisory Commission shall not
be limited to the originally designated Historic District. Instead, if this
district is ever enlarged or decreased in size or if additional districts are
ever formed, only one Historic District Advisory Commission shall be appointed
by the Council.
      (7)   The Historic District Advisory Commission may also prepare or have
prepared cultural or architectural resource surveys and inventories of the
community or parts of it. It may also review and comment on applications for
enlarging or decreasing the size of the original historic district or on the

eligible which will enhance the objective of preserving the unique historical

require review by the Historic District Advisory Commission in order to obtain

integrity of the structure. This exception will, however, only be granted in
the case of an actual emergency as certified by the Town Manager.
      (2)   Emergency demolitions which are required to preserve the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the municipality. These emergencies shall
also be certified by the Town Manager.
   (D)   Additional requirements. In addition to the requirements for plans and
other details which the municipality has for issuing a building or demolition
permit, the Historic District Advisory Commission may require the following:
      (1)   A plan, drawn to scale, which shows the location of all existing
structures on the property and the location of all proposed changes, a plan
showing the location of all existing and proposed parking areas, driveways,
easements and/or rights-of-way and other information deemed necessary by the
Commission.
      (2)   Drawings showing one or more elevations of the proposed changes.
      (3)   A cost and/or benefit analysis of a proposed project or demolition
which contains:
         (a)   An estimate of the dollar value of the subject property, both
real and personal;
         (b)   A review of the requirements for making any existing historic
structures structurally sound;
         (c)   A qualified estimate of the cost of rehabilitating the
structures, if any, existing on the subject property; and
         (d)   An analysis of the return which would be required on the subject
project which would be needed to make rehabilitation of the existing structure
economically attractive.
      (4)   The requirements for this information will be defined by the
Commission, in writing, to the applicant for a building or demolition permit at
least ten days prior to the meeting at which the application will be reviewed.
Failure by the applicant to provide this information will be a sufficient basis
for denying the application. This information shall become part of the
Commission’s record of the meeting and may be used to establish conditions for
the issuance of a building or demolition permit.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.001 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AIR GAP. A physical separation between the free flowing discharge end of a
potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. An
APPROVED AIR GAP shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe
measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel, in no case less than
one inch (2.54 cm).
   APPROVED. The term APPROVED, as herein used in reference to a water supply,
shall mean a water supply that has been approved by the health agency having
jurisdiction. The term APPROVED is herein used in reference to an air gap, a
double check valve assembly, a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly or other backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall mean an
approval by the administrative authority having jurisdiction.
   APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY (ASSEMBLY). Any testable assembly,
with the exception of an approved air gap, which has been issued a certificate
of approval by the University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-
Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (USCFCCCHR or the foundation) or the
other third party certifying entity, unrelated to the product's manufacturer or
vendor, which may be acceptable to the State Department of Environmental
Quality. A list of assemblies shall be maintained by the Utility
Superintendent.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's approved public water supply will be considered as an
auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from other
purveyor's public potable water supply or other natural source(s) such as a
well, spring, river, stream, harbor and the like or used waters or industrial
fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be
objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water
purveyor does not have sanitary control.
   BACK PRESSURE. A form of backflow due to any elevation of pressure in the
downstream piping system (by pump, elevation of piping or stream and/or
pressure) above the supply pressure at the point of service delivery which
would cause, or tend to cause, a reversal of the normal direction of flow
through the backflow prevention assembly.
   BACK SIPHONAGE. A form of backflow due to a reduction in system pressure
which causes a negative or sub-atmospheric pressure to exit at a site in the
water system.
   BACKFLOW. The undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and
other liquids, gases or other substances into the distribution system of the
public potable water supply.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTOR. An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.
   CERTIFIED TESTER. An individual certified to test backflow prevention
assemblies by the California-Nevada Section of the American Water Works
Association (AWWA), the Arizona State Environmental Technology Training (ASETT)
Center or other agencies or organizations involved with the training and
certification of testers if they are acceptable to the State Department of
Environmental Quality.
   COMMON AREA. A recreational or open space area or areas maintained for the
benefit of the residents of a housing development which is owned and operated
as a single integrated facility.
   COMPANY. The town water division.
   CONSUMER. The person using water delivered to the premises, building or
establishment where used, or for whose account and use the water is delivered,
and also the owner, occupant, tenant and lessee of the premises, building or
establishment.
   CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of the water which creates an
actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of
disease by sewage, industrial fluids, waste and the like.
   CONTIGUOUS. In contact at any point along a boundary or part of the same
master planned community, two parcels of land are contiguous even if they are
separated by one or more of the following: a road, easement or right-of-way.
   CROSS CONNECTION. Any unprotected, potential connection or structural
arrangement between a public or a customer's potable water system and any other
source or system through which it is possible to introduce into any part of the
potable water system any used water, industrial fluid, gas or substance other
than the intended potable water with which the system is supplied. Bypass
arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover
devices and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of
which backflow can, or may occur, are considered to be CROSS CONNECTIONS.
Compliance with the town Plumbing Code creates a rebuttable presumption that a
cross connection does not exist.
   CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL BY CONTAINMENT. The appropriate type or method of
backflow protection at the service connection, commensurate with the degree of
hazard of the consumer's potable water system.
   CROSS CONNECTIONS CONTROLLED. A connection between a potable water supply
system and a non-potable water system with an approved backflow prevention
assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford
the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.

consumer's potable water system that may be either a pollutional or a
contamination type hazard. This includes, but is not limited to, cross-
connections to toilets, sinks, lavatories, wash trays and law sprinkling
systems. Plumbing type cross-connections can be located in many types of
structures, including homes, apartment houses, hotels and commercial or
industrial establishments. Such a connection, if permitted to exist, must be
properly protected by an appropriate type of backflow prevention assembly.
   HAZARD; POLLUTIONAL. An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or the potability of the public or the
consumer's potable water system, but which would not constitute a HEALTH or

§ 50.046 CONSTRUCTION; OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE.
   The extension of all water mains and service connections shall be
constructed in strict accordance with plans and specifications to be approved
by the Utility Department. All extensions and service connections shall be, and
remain the property of, the Utility Department after acceptance by the town.
Main extensions and service connections shall be maintained by the Department
up to, and including, the consumer's meter and shall be operated by the
Department as part of the distribution system. The Department shall exercise
complete control over the extensions, and upon completion, the person
responsible for the construction of the extension shall relinquish all right to

§ 50.047 POLICY OF TOWN GENERALLY.
   The water main extension policy of the town for town water mains and the
policy to be followed in connection therewith shall be, and the same is hereby
declared to be as follows:
   (A)   Developers must pay all costs for constructing mains of the sizes as
to afford adequate service during peak demands.
   (B)   The minimum water requirements will be three gallons per minute per
service with a minimum residual pressure of 40 pounds per square inch at the
meter.
   (C)   The Utility Director will approve the developer's required size and
lay-out of public water mains that will meet both domestic water needs and fire
flow requirements as required by this code.
   (D)   The Town Engineer will not perform field engineering nor submit
detailed plans and specifications for any developer. This work is to be
performed by a civil engineer registered in the state and employed by the
developer. Before construction begins, final detailed plans and specifications
for the water main extensions in the development must be approved by the
Utility Department. The cost of staking the location of the new water mains and
the cost of inspecting the construction shall be assumed by the developer. The
town will perform the inspections during construction.
   (E)   Where booster pumps are necessary to maintain adequate pressures in
the mains due to the development being near or above the hydraulic gradient of
the distribution system of the town service area, the developer shall construct
at his or her own expense the necessary booster pumping station and storage
facilities to town specifications. The town will assume ownership, maintenance
and operation of the booster pump installation upon its completion and
acceptance by the town.
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. II, § 18-51) (Ord. 346-04, passed 6-21-2004; Ord.
746-25, passed 1-6-2025)
§ 50.048 EXTENSIONS IN SUBDIVISIONS, SINGLE LOT, SUBLOT DEVELOPMENTS AND ALL
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   In all new subdivisions and single lot developments and all other
developments, other than a single residence on a single lot, where the town is
to provide water service, the developer shall furnish and install in accordance
with plans approved by the Utility Director, all water mains, service
connections, valves, fittings and appurtenances within the boundary of the
development as well as the streets bounding the entire development. Review fees
shall be paid as set forth in the town code. In addition, the developer shall
furnish and install all off-site water mains as necessary to complete a looped
connection to existing town mains as determined by the Utility Department. All
water lines are to be constructed as a general area improvement whether they
do, or do not provide service to the property being developed. For developments
principally residential in character, the town requires that 12-inch diameter
lines be provided on section line streets, eight-inch lines on mid-section line
streets and six-inch lines on all other streets. Four inch lines shall be
allowed in short residential cul-de-sac streets where the number of service
shall not exceed ten, and the maximum length of the four-inch water mains shall
not exceed 400 feet. For developments other than those principally residential
in character, the minimum size of the mains installed by the developer shall be
six inches or larger, consistent with needs of the development, including fire
flow requirements. For all developments, fire hydrants, valves, pipe and
fitting required for the hydrant installation shall also be installed by the
developer in accordance with plans approved by the Utility Director. Review
fees shall be paid as set forth in accordance with plans approved by the
Utility Director. Review fees shall be paid as set forth in the Town Code. The
maximum spacing of fire hydrants along public water mains shall be
approximately 500 feet in a single-family residential development and
approximately 300 feet in all others. Fire hydrant locations within the bounds
of any development shall be such that fire hose lengths will not be more than
300 feet to reach any potential fire in the tract.
   (B)   Existing lines larger than 12 inches in diameter are considered part
of the transmission system, and are not part of the water distribution master
grid system. Developers may be required to construct distribution mains of the
required size in parallel to the existing transmission mains. Where existing
distribution system mains within a development, or the streets bounding a
development are smaller in size than that required by this code, or are
otherwise inadequate, the developer may be required to replace or parallel the
mains with those of the required size.
   (C)   Where no water main is existing along the frontage of a single,
existing, residential lot zoned for single-family use, and the developer of the
single lot requests water service, sufficient length of main shall be
constructed by the developer to extend the new main from an existing water main
to the point of the requested service connection, plus an additional ten feet.
If the Utility Director determines after a review of the size, length and
location of the line, that an approach main repayment agreement is practical,
and the applicant desires to enter into such an agreement, the new water main
shall be constructed to and across the entire lot frontage.
   (D)   The service connections installed by a developer's contractor shall be
guaranteed against any and all defects by the developer for a period of two
years after acceptance of the installation by the Utility Department.
   (E)   No one except authorized town personnel shall be permitted to install,
remove or reinstall water meters. Any developer whose contractor, plumber (or
others) removes, changes or relocates water meters shall be charged the cost to
the town for restoring meters to their authorized and designated locations of
records. The costs together with any cost incurred by the town for repairing
defective service connections installed by developer's contractors shall be due
and payable within 60 days of billing for the charges by the town.
   (F)   After acceptance by the town of the water mains and service
connections, the developer or his or her agent may make applications to the
Utility Department for the installation of one or more meters to be installed
on the new service connections to measure construction water used. The
developer will be held responsible for all water used from the date the meter
is set until there is a change in ownership.
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. II, § 18-52) (Ord. 346-04, passed 6-21-2004; Ord.
746-25, passed 1-6-2025)
§ 50.049 CONSTRUCTION WATER THROUGH METERED SERVICE CONNECTIONS; RATES.
   (A)   The Utility Department will accept applications from a developer or
his or her authorized agent for the installation of a meter to measure water to
be used for construction, provided that a service connection, including a curb
stop and meter box, has been installed and accepted for service by the town.
   (B)   The Water and Wastewater Division will prepare a separate billing for
each metered service connection used to supply water for construction and the
following charges will be applicable:
      (1)   Inside the town.
         (a)   For each metered service connection used to supply water for
construction, a minimum charge will be in accordance with the prevailing inside
municipality water rates. The minimum charge shall not be construed as a
monthly minimum, but shall apply as a minimum for the initial 120 days of the
construction period and monthly minimums thereafter.
         (b)   When a metered application is made, the developer or his or her
authorized agent will be required to prepay the minimum billing for each meter
connection. The developer will be held responsible for all water used from the
date the meter is set until there is a change of ownership. The developer will
be required to submit in writing to the Water and Wastewater Division, the name
of the new owner, the correct street address and the date of the change of
ownership. When this information is furnished, a final reading and billing will
be prepared. In no event will any portion of the minimum billing be refundable
and any charge in excess of the minimum will be billed to the developer.
      (2)   Outside the town. For each metered service connection used to
supply water for construction, the above requirements shall apply except that
the prevailing outside the municipality water rates for the particular area
shall be used to compute charges.
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. II, § 18-53) (Ord. 346-04, passed 6-21-2004; Ord.
746-25, passed 1-6-2025)
§ 50.050 REPAYMENTS; MAINS BY DEVELOPERS (APPROACH MAINS).
   The water main repayment policy of the town for developer water main
extensions, is declared to be as follows:
   (A)   The town desires to encourage the development of undeveloped areas
through re-payment for costs incurred in the construction of “off-site” water
mains that are necessary to serve new developments, in order “to distribute the
costs of extending the mains between two or more developers”. This policy would
apply where an “approach main” was extended by one developer and connected to
at a later date by one or more developers. An APPROACH MAIN is defined as a
main extended beyond the limits of the project or a main constructed along the
frontage or boundary of the development.
   (B)   In the event that a proposed new development or project finds it
necessary to extend water mains from a distant point in order to serve the
development or project, the cost of the main extension, designated as an
“approach main” will be included in a separate agreement. The town will limit
the maximum size of the approach main entirely at the developer's cost to 12
inches in diameter, where required on section lines or grid arterials, and to
eight inches in diameter on mid-section lines or mid-grid feeders.
   (C)   The town reserves the right to increase the diameter of the approach
main, if it deemed advisable, but under this condition the town will furnish
sufficient pipe so that the laid cost of the approach main or larger diameter
pipe to the subdivider or developer, will not exceed the laid cost of the same
extension if it were an eight-inch diameter pipe on mid-section streets or mid-
grid feeders, and 12 inches on section line streets of grid arterials, where
required.
   (D)   The final detailed plans and specifications for the “approach main”
extension must be approved by the Utility Director prior to construction. The
engineering costs for the preparation of plans, specifications and staking of
the “approach main” incurred in by the developer may be included in the agreed
construction costs as provided for in this section. The cost of distribution
mains within the boundary of the development shall not be eligible for
repayment.
   (E)   A charge of $265 will be assessed by the town for the administration
of each repayment agreement.
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. II, § 18-54) (Ord. 346-04, passed 6-21-2004; Ord.
746-25, passed 1-6-2025)
§ 50.051 ENGINEERING COSTS; INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The costs for the preparation of construction plans for the proposed
water mains as well as the costs of staking the location of the water mains,
the cost of inspecting the construction, the costs of acquiring rights-of-way
and easements and preparation of as-built plans, shall be part of the
construction cost assumed by the developer in accordance with plans approved by
the Utility Director. Review fees shall be paid as set forth in the Town Code.
   (B)   The Utility Department will not perform field engineering or submit
detailed plans and specifications for the developer. This latter work is to be
performed by a civil engineer registered in the state employed by the
developer. The final detailed plan and specification for the “approach main”
extension must be approved by the Utility Department before construction
begins. The engineering cost for preparation of plans and staking of the
“approach main” only, incurred by the developer may be included in the agreed
construction cost as provided in §
50.050. The engineering costs will be agreed upon by the town and developer for
determination of total construction cost prior to completion of the repayment
agreement.

SERVICE CONNECTIONS
§ 50.070 CONNECTION TO WATER MAINS REQUIRED.
   Where property is located upon a street in which a water main is laid, the
property shall be connected with the water system. These services shall extend
at right angles from the main to the curblines and shall be installed in
accordance with the town's standard detail. The number, location, manner of
construction and size of all service connections shall be subject to the
approval of the Director.

   Every separate building supplied with town water must have its own separate
service connection with the town mains, except two or more buildings located on
the same lot, or property that is known as a court, apartment house, trailer
court or other similar developments covering more than one lot may be, upon
written permission granted by the Director, supplied through a single metered
connection with the town main as long as single ownership continues. Upon
change from the single ownership, a new and separate connection shall be
immediately made for the building or premises having the indirect connection.

a variance of more than five days in reading a particular meter and rendering a
bill thereon in the subsequent month.
   (B)   Bills for water will be computed in accord with the company's
authorized rate schedule and will be based on the amount of water consumed for
the period covered by the meter readings, except that where a consumer orders a
turn-on resulting in a period of availability of service of less than 16 days.
This consumption will be carried over to the next month's billing.
   (C)   Charge for service commences when the meter is installed and
connection made, whether used or not.
   (D)   Bills are due when rendered and delinquent on the last of the month
following billing. Delinquent notices with a ten-day cut-off notice with a re-
connection charge will be sent to each delinquent account. If the account is
not paid at the end of the ten-day period, the service may be discontinued.
Service discontinued for delinquency of bills will be restored only after all
due bills are paid in full, redeposit made, if required, and a service charge
paid for each service established (see Town of Florence Schedule of Fees).
   (E)   Failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent the bills from
becoming delinquent nor relieve the consumer of his or her obligations therein.
   (F)   If the consumer believes his or her bill to be in error, he or she
shall present his or her claim at the company's office before the bill becomes
delinquent.
   (G)   The company will make special meter readings at the request of the
consumer for a fee; provided; however, that if the special reading discloses

his or her previous bills or from other proper data.
   (J)   If the meter fails to register or stops for any cause of which the
consumer is not responsible, the first month's bill may be estimated by the
company, but thereafter the consumer shall be billed the regular monthly
minimum until the meter is repaired or replaced.
   (K)   When an apparent or hidden leak has been determined or discovered in
the customer water service, and the customer has the leak repaired within five
days after being notified by town personnel or electronically by the WaterSmart
system, or having discovered the leak, or if the customer does not own the
premises to which the water service is furnished, if certified in writing to
the town that he or she notified the owner of the premises of the leak within
ten days after being notified or having discovered the leak, and adjustment of
the customer's water and sewer charge may be made after evaluation from the
Utility Department and the determination of the Finance Director. The water
bill adjustment shall be for a period not exceeding 30 days prior to repair of
the leak or, in the case of a customer who does not own the premises, 30 days
prior to the notification of the leak, by the customer to the owner, and the
charge for water service for the 30-day period may be adjusted downward in the
amount of one-half the normal charge for the water service as to the owner of
the premises. No adjustment shall be made to the charge for water service to
any customer more often than once every two years for any one location. Sewer
charge shall be made at the normal or average water usage for the period being
adjusted. Consideration may be given to average monthly usage in the same year
or prior period(s) in the previous year. The Finance Department will provide
the adjustment and provide communications with the customer. Only the
responsible party on the utility billing shall be able to request and receive
adjustments.
   (L)   The Water Division shall maintain all service lines from the main to,
and including the first valve or meter yoke, but not the house side connection
thereto. In the case where no valve is located in the service line and the
meter is located on the private property of the owner, it shall be the
responsibility of the owner to maintain the service line from the main to the
building being served. On branch service piping, the first valve is the tapping
valve or gate valve fitting to the tee. Apparent leaks in the customer's water
installation, whether registered on the water meter or not, shall be repaired
by the customer within five days of receipt of written notice by the Water
Division. If repairs are not made, the town shall issue a written notice of an
intended disconnect and, five days thereafter, may discontinue water service
until the leak is repaired. If, in the judgment of town personnel, the leak
endangers public safety, constitutes a serious nuisance or wastes substantial
amounts of water, water service may be discontinued without prior notice to the
customer. Hidden leaks in the customer's water installation shall be repaired,
after discovery under the same provisions as apparent leaks.

SEWER EXTENSIONS
§ 51.055 CONSTRUCTION AND OWNERSHIP OF PUBLIC SEWER LINES AND OTHER EQUIPMENT
MAINTAINED BY WATER AND WASTEWATER DIVISION.
   (A)   In new subdivisions and developments where public sewers are
authorized by the Utility Director, the public sewers shall be constructed at
the developer's expense in accordance with plans approved by the Utility
Director. Detailed plans and specifications for public sewer extensions must be
approved by the Utility Director prior to construction. The costs for the
preparation of plans and specifications, the staking of the location of the new
public sewers, the cost of inspecting the construction, the cost of acquiring
rights-of-way and easements and preparation of as-built plans shall be assumed
by the developer. The town will perform the inspection during construction.
   (B)   The ownership of the public sewer lines, pumping stations, treatment
facilities and equipment and other appurtenances to the sewer system
maintained, or accepted for maintenance, by the Water and Wastewater Division
shall be vested in the Division, and in no case shall the owner of any premises
have the right to claim any part except where otherwise provided in this code.
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. III, § 18-170) (Ord. 346-04, passed 6-21-2004; Ord.
747-25, passed 1-6-2025)
§ 51.056 MAIN SEWER EXTENSION POLICY FOR AREAS BEYOND PRESENT TOWN TRUNK LINES.
   The main sewer extension policy of the town for areas beyond present town
trunk sewers and the policy to be followed in connection therewith shall be,
and the same is hereby, declared to be as follows:
   (A)   The town desires to encourage the development of undeveloped areas
through repayment for extra costs incurred in construction of “off-site” sewer
mains that are necessary to serve development in order to distribute the costs
of extending the mains between two or more developers. This policy would apply
where a sewer main extension was constructed by one developer and connected or
utilized at a later date by one or more developers. For this purpose, a SEWER
MAIN is defined as a main extended beyond the limits of the project or a main
constructed along the frontage or boundary of the development with capacity to
serve additional developments. However, the developer must pay all the costs
for engineering design and construction of main sewers of the size as to afford
adequate capacity and service for specific “service areas” to be served by town
trunk sewers.
   (B)   The Town Engineer will not perform field engineering or submit
detailed plans and specifications for the developer. This latter work is to be
performed by a civil engineer registered in the state, employed by the
developer. The final details plans and specifications for the main sewer
extension must be approved by the Town Engineer and the Utility Director before
construction begins. The engineering costs for preparation of plans and staking
of the main sewer incurred by the developer may be included as determined by
the Director in the agreed construction costs as provided in this section.
   (C)   The final detailed plans and specifications for the main sewer
extensions must be approved by ADEQ and by the Council before construction
begins. The design and engineering will be in accordance with the
specifications of the State Department of Environmental Quality and the
municipality prior to construction. The construction shall meet the
municipality's specifications, requirements and approval, and will be subject
to inspection by the municipality's agents during construction.
   (D)   In new subdivisions, shopping centers, industrial tracts or similar
developments, the developer shall furnish and install to town specifications
all branch, lateral and main sewers, manholes and appurtenances within the
boundary of the designated area of the development.
   (E)   The design and engineering will be in accordance with the
specifications of the town and must be approved by the Town Engineer of the
town prior to the construction. The construction shall meet the town
specifications, requirements and approval and will be subject to inspection by
the Town Engineer during construction.
   (F)   Upon its completion, the aforesaid main sewer line shall become and be
the property of the town.
   (G)   The maximum area to be serviced by the proposed main sewer line and
its ultimate branches and laterals shall be determined by the Public Works
Department based on local drainage conditions.
   (H)   The town shall have exclusive control of connections to the proposed
main sewer line.
   (I)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, all provisions of this
code and other ordinances of the town or amendments thereto applicable to sewer
services inside and outside the town boundaries, including all charges
therefore, shall apply to services in the proposed area.
   (J)   Should others in the service area desire to join with the developer in
constructing the proposed main sewer line, this agreement will be considered as
including the others.
   (K)   In the event that the area to be serviced by the developer is lesser
in size than the maximum area to be serviced by the proposed main sewer line
and its ultimate laterals, the aforesaid main sewer line shall be designed,
engineered and constructed to serve the maximum area as described heretofore.
   (L)   In the event that the area to be serviced by the developer is the
entire area above described as the maximum service area, then the developer
will not be eligible for repayment.
   (M)   The town, in consideration of the foregoing, agrees:
      (1)   To permit the developer to connect into town existing trunk sewer
lines and the main sewer line to be constructed by the developer as above
provided;
      (2)   In the event that the area to be serviced by the developer is
smaller than the maximum area to be serviced by the proposed main sewer line
and its ultimate branches and laterals. The town agrees to enter into an
agreement with any party desirous of obtaining a connection to the main sewer
line;
      (3)   Such an agreement will establish a just, equitable and reasonable
charge to permit such a connection. The connection charge will be made on a
cost per acre basis on the area to be served, using the heretofore agreed main
sewer line construction cost based on competitive bidding and maximum service
area acreage to determine the cost per acre;
      (4)   Any connection charge will not affect the right of the town to
assess its regular tax charges and sewage rental charges against the owners of
property within the developer's area;
      (5)   Building connection charges (sewer tap) shall be paid to the town
at the prevailing rate and are not refundable; and
      (6)   A charge of $100 will be assessed by the town for the
administration of each repayment agreement (see Town of Florence Schedule of
Fees).
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. III, § 18-171) (Ord. 346-04, passed 6-21-2004; Ord.

§ 51.057 COSTS OF EXTENSION.
   The developer shall pay the costs for utility extension using one of the
following two options:
   (A)   Option I. The developer shall pay in full for the rights-of-way, the
construction and installation of the lines, pipes and mains, and all other
features of the extension.
   (B)   Option II.
      (1)   The construction cost of the extension shall be determined and
agreed upon prior to commencement of construction after the developer has
submitted a cost breakdown to the Town Engineer. The engineering costs incurred
by the developer for the preparation of plans and staking of the main sewer
only be included in the agreed construction cost. Costs of lateral and branch
sewers and their appurtenances will not be included in the agreed construction
or in the main sewer project agreement. The municipality shall reserve the
right to reject the developer's cost breakdown if it is in appreciable variance
with the municipality's estimate.
      (2)   In the event that the area to be serviced by the developer is the
entire area described herein as the maximum service area, then the developer
will pay in full for the cost of construction and will not be eligible for
repayment. In the event that the area to be serviced by the developer is lesser
in size than the maximum area to be serviced by the proposed main sewer line
and its ultimate branches and laterals, the municipality agrees to enter into
agreements with any party desirous of obtaining a connection to the main sewer
line. The agreement will establish a just, equitable and reasonable charge to
permit the connection, the charge to be made on a cost per acre a basis of the
area to be served, using the heretofore agreed main sewer line construction
cost and maximum service area acreage to determine the cost per acre. The
amount of the connection charge will be paid to the municipality, who agrees to
repay the amount to the developer, the total of the repayments not to exceed
that portion of the agreed cost of the construction of the main sewer line
allotted to acreage outside of the development.
      (3)   In no such way is any such agreement to be constructed as including
any branch of lateral within the service area.
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. III, § 18-171.1) (Ord. 346-04, passed 6-21-2004)
§ 51.058 OWNERSHIP.
   The municipality shall have exclusive control of connections to the proposed
main sewer line and upon its completion, the main line shall become and be the
property of the municipality. Except as otherwise herein provided, all
provisions of this code and ordinances and amendments thereto applicable to
sewer services including all charges therefore shall apply to services in the
approved area.

§ 51.059 SEWER EXTENSIONS IN ADVANCE OF A SEWER ASSESSMENT DISTRICT.
   The sewer extension policy provisions of the town in regards to sewer
installations in advance of sewer assessment districts and the policy to be
followed in connection therewith shall be, and the same is hereby, declared to
be as follows:
   (A)   At the option of the developer of an individual parcel of land or of
subdivision, he or she may apply for payment of the sewer line or lines
necessary to connect his or her development to a trunk sewer. He or she may
also apply for payment of the sewer lines within his or her development.
   (B)   In order to qualify for payment, the sewer lines to be installed must
be usable by a future assessment district, and the developer must sign an
agreement whereby the assessable area of any parcel or parcels immediately
adjacent to and served by the lines will be included in the assessment district
and will receive an assessment for which the developer will be liable,
regardless of whether he or she sells part or all of the property to be
assessed.
   (C)   The developer shall pay all construction costs, including engineering
services. The design, location and construction must be approved by the town.
The contractor shall be duly licensed.
   (D)   The sewer lines installed by the developer will be held in trust by
the town for sale to a special assessment district in the town. The agreed
construction cost, not exceeding the actual cost for the lines, will be written
into the construction bid as a lump sum item and will become part of the
construction cost for the special assessment district.
   (E)   The property owners adjacent to lines installed by the developer can
connect to these lines by signing an agreement, which will be recorded, to
accept an assessment in the assessment district.
   (F)   If the developer desires to enter into private agreements with
adjacent property owners in which they agree to share his or her cost for the
privilege of connecting to the sewer lateral, he or she may do so, but these
property owners will still be required to sign an agreement with the division
in which they agree to accept an assessment in the assessment's district.
   (G)   There will be only one purchase agreement for each project. No attempt
will be made to negotiate with more than one party, regardless of how many are
sharing the cost.
   (H)   Payment will be made at the completion of the assessment district or
at the time that assessments become payable.

§ 52.002 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health and
safety of the citizens of the town and to protect the environment by
establishing minimum standards for the storage, collection, treatment,
transportation, processing and disposal of solid waste. In addition, to set
rates charged by the town for its solid waste program and its inspection,
collection and disposal services, so as to recover the town's costs to provide
such services.
   
   (B)   Collection required. Solid waste collections shall be made by the town
or by collection companies as authorized by the town. Except as provided in
divisions (C) and (D) of the section, all persons and properties within the
town are required to use the solid waste collection system of the town, to
haul, carry or transport solid waste through the streets and highways of the
town. All persons and occupied property shall use and be responsible for at
least the minimum level of solid waste collection service and the associated
charges and fees for residential, institutional or commercial service, as
applicable, unless exempted from such requirements under this division or
division (C) of this section. It shall be unlawful to dump or store solid
waste, recyclable, or yard waste materials in violation of the provisions of
this chapter. The town shall automatically bill the residential or commercial
customer for such minimum level of service if the customer does not sign up for
service within 30 days of occupying a property in the town. Upon satisfactory
evidence that a residential customer owns a business in the town that has a
commercial solid waste collection service, the Director may in his discretion
approve an exemption from the mandatory solid waste collection service and
payment requirements of this section.
   (C)   Commercial permitted hauler. Those commercial and industrial business
establishments having prior established permits to haul their own waste may
continue to haul such solid waste by annual permit. Renewal permits shall be
issued upon application and payment of the annual permit fee. Any permit
holder, as provided for in this subsection, shall haul solid waste at least
once a week for public health reasons.
   (D)   Self-haul. This section does not prohibit the limited and occasional
hauling of solid waste, recyclable materials, or yard wastes by a customer from
their property to an approved town solid waste, recyclables, or yard waste
collection site. However, occasional haulers are not exempt from the mandatory
solid waste collection service and payment requirements above and are
responsible for the fees for collection site services, if any.
   (E)   Penalty. Violations of the provisions of this section are punishable
as provided in §
52.999(B)(2) of this chapter.

ALARM SYSTEMS
§ 92.20 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter is intended to regulate the activities and responsibilities
of those persons who purchase, lease or rent and those persons who own or
conduct the business of selling, leasing, renting, maintaining or monitoring
alarm systems, devices or services. It is further intended to encourage the

responding to actual criminal activity as a result of false alarms. This
subchapter specifically encompasses “burglar alarms” and “panic” or “hold-up
alarms” both audible and inaudible (silent).

§ 96.23 BACKFILL AND COMPACTION.
   (A)   Backfill shall consist of sound earth material (other than open graded
rock) free from concrete, timber, asphalt pavement or other debris. When select
material, or A.B.C. material, is substituted or specified, it shall conform to
the applicable specifications for construction of highways of the M.A.G.
Specifications.
   (B)   Compaction of backfill materials shall be governed by the following:
      (1)   That portion of the backfill from the bottom of the trench to eight
inches, compacted depth, over the top of the pipe shall be back-filled with
uniformly graded material with maximum size passing a one and one-eight-inch
screen. This material shall be uniformly jetted to ensure proper bedding of
pipe. Backfill around underground electric lines must meet the specification of
the responsible electrical utility.
      (2)   For the purpose of these special provisions, WATER SETTLING is
defined as the addition of water to backfill material in an excavation in such
a quantity as to make the water content of the material higher than the optimum
moisture as determined by Standard Proctor Test (AASHO T-99). Water settling is
not permitted where the excavation is in an existing pavement or where any
portion of the excavation falls within a distance from the edge of existing
pavement or back of curb equal to one- half the depth of the trench, measured
from the edge of pavement or gutter line.
      (3)   Water settling is permitted in new subdivisions under the following
conditions:
         (a)   Fill material in lifts not exceeding eight feet in depth shall
be leveled, the trench flooded and the material jetted to within one foot of
the pipe with sufficient water to ensure filling of all voids with backfill
material.
         (b)   No paving will be permitted over water settled trenches until
compaction test results have been approved by the Director of Public Works.
Water settling is permitted beyond the limits of division (B)(2) above with a
required compaction of 85%, or the natural compaction of the native material,
whichever is higher.
   (C)   Where an excavation meets the criteria of division (B)(2) above, the
excavation shall be filled with A.B.C. or granular select material, placed at
optimum moisture in lifts sufficiently thin to ensure required compaction for
the full depth of the lift, and in no case greater than 30 inches compacted
depth, unless previously approved in writing by the Director of Public Works.
Granular select material shall not exceed three inches in diameter and shall be
graded in such a manner as to ensure the exclusion of any and all voids in the
backfill. The upper two feet is to be mechanically compacted to not less than
95% of maximum density. Sufficient water may be added to raise the moisture
content to optimum only. Below these two feet, the material shall be compacted
to not less than 85% of the maximum density for the backfill material as
determined by AASHO Test T-99. Field determination of density shall be made in
accordance with AASHO Test T-147 or other test procedure previously approved in
writing by the Director of Public Works.
   (D)   The minimum cover for utility lines shall be 36 inches, other than
direct burial cable which shall be 24 inches. The minimum cover for storm
drainage or irrigation pipe shall be 18 inches. COVER is defined as the
difference in elevation between the top of the line or pipe and the ultimate
gutter grade of the roadway. If paving is not completed within 30 days after
installation of the underground facilities, a temporary earth cover sufficient
to meet the above requirements must be placed and maintained.
   (E)   For facilities outside the area defined in division (B)(2) above,
COVER is defined as the difference in elevation between the top of the line or
pipe and the natural or regraded ground surface, whichever is lesser.

the Director of Public Works or his or her representative. A minimum of one set
of tests will be required for each four feet of trench depth for trenches
within the area defined in §
96.23(B)(2). The minimum number of passing tests per set anticipated to prove
specification compliance may be estimated at the following rates:
      (1)   Pavement cut crossings: one test per crossing;
      (2)   Pavement cuts or trenches within two feet of pavement edge: two
tests per 500 lineal feet;
      (3)   At all other locations: one test per 400 lineal feet;
      (4)   Test may be taken at four foot vertical increments in the same
vertical plane at the option of the Engineer of Record; and
   (B)   Copies of all test reports shall be sent directly to the Engineer of
Record from the testing laboratory, and to the Director of Public Works within

places for constructing and operating a cable system; to promote the widespread
availability of high-quality cable communications services to town residents
and businesses, including to those who reside in multi-family or multi-use
buildings and in rural areas; to encourage the development of cable as a means
of communication between and among the members of the public and public
institutions; to encourage the provision of diverse information to the

      (4)   Any additional types of insurance and coverage amounts as the town
may require. All insurance policies must be with sureties qualified to do
business in the state and in a form approved by the Town Attorney. The town may
accept a self-insurance plan that assures comparable protection in lieu of
these insurance policies.
   (B)   To ensure the licensee's performance of license obligations, a
licensee must have in force at all times during the license period, a bond in a
form approved by the Town Attorney, consisting of cash, an irrevocable letter
of credit, or a performance bond. A performance bond must be provided by a

failure by the licensee to secure consent from the owner, authorized
distributor, or licensee of a program to be delivered by the cable system.
   (D)   In an overbuild situation, the town may require written agreements
from a new provider or overbuilder to indemnify the incumbent for any damages
or outages the incumbent experiences arising from the construction and
maintenance if the overbuilder's or new licensee's respective systems. The town
may also require mutual indemnification from all providers for any damage to
facilities and services caused by construction or maintenance of their
respective cable systems.
   (E)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, licensee shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the town, its agents, officers, officials and
employees from and against all tort claims, damages, losses and expenses
(including but not limited to attorney fees, court costs, and the cost of
appellate proceedings), relating to, arising out of, or alleged to have
resulted either wholly or in part from the acts, errors, mistakes, omissions,
work or services of the licensee, its agents, employees, contractors or
subcontractors in the performance of this agreement, and regardless of whether
or not such claim, damages, loss or expenses are caused in part by the town. By

property including loss of use resulting there from, caused either wholly or in
part by licensee's acts, errors, mistakes, omissions, work or services in the
performance of this agreement including any employee of the licensee or any
other person for whose acts, errors, mistakes, omissions, work or services the
licensee may be legally liable, and regardless of whether or not such claim,
damages, losses or expenses are caused in part by the town.
   (G)   The amount and type of insurance coverage requirements set forth
herein will in no way be construed as limiting the scope of the indemnity in
this division.

366-05, passed 3-7-2005)
§ 118.27 MINIMUM FACILITIES AND SERVICES.
   (A)   The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply
to all licenses:
      (1)   A cable system must have a minimum capacity of 90 video channels
available for immediate or potential use.
      (2)   “EG” channels or educational and government channels: A cable
system must dedicate or set aside capacity, equipment and operation of access
channels for programming, content and use by government and educational
institutions as required by federal law. The licensee must provide information
on all access channels in its annual report under §
118.29(A).
         (a)   A cable system must provide up to two access channels, which
will be individually designated by the town for educational or governmental
access. The town may require the licensee to make a reasonable contribution to
capital costs for access studios and related equipment and facilities if the
standard channels and equipment are already in place or need to be upgraded.
All licensees are to provide, at no charge to the town, modulators, processors,
and all necessary transmission equipment for these channels and agree to design
the system to accommodate the desired connections from the town hall to all
headends throughout the town systems to all customers.
         (b)   Licensees shall also provide, at no charge, prompt and regular
maintenance and replacement of any cables, amplifiers and other distribution
equipment used for the educational and governmental channels, except for if the
town or educational institution desires relocation of the primary points of
origin, the town or educational institution shall bear the cost of such
relocation. Licensees shall also provide programming and studio/production
training or consulting support at no cost to either entity once the channels
become operational.
         (c)   Capital grant provisions: Licensees shall provide funding to the
town and educational institution to:
            1.   Purchase or otherwise furnish all necessary equipment not
otherwise furnished in the above section in an amount not to exceed $7,500 lump
sum per entity; and
            2.   Provide a capital investment fee of $.50 per customer, per
month for the maintenance, support, upgrade and equipment lease payments
necessary of the educational and government channels; and
            3.   Provide the ability to lease (at cost) or purchase from
licensee any other equipment the town or educational institution deems
necessary to establish and operate such access throughout the community.
         (d)   Service to all public buildings owned and operated by the town
and the Florence Unified School District. Licensee will provide all service
drops without charge to the town and details (including locations of such
facilities) are to be set forth in the license agreement.
      (3)   Emergency notification system: A licensee must design its system to
allow the town to interrupt cable service in an emergency to deliver necessary
information to subscribers in accordance with FCC rules. The system shall be
installed and operated with an emergency alert system in compliance with the
rules of the Federal Communications Commission and the state “Emergency Alert
System Operation Plan” (“state plan”), as amended from time to time, provided,
however, that, notwithstanding any such FCC or state rules, the system shall be
configured such that, in the event of a local emergency as reasonably
determined by the town, the town shall be able to interrupt, to the extent not
prohibited by FCC regulations or the state plan, audio and video signals
distributed over the system for the delivery of appropriate signals
necessitated by such emergency. The emergency override system will be operated
in accordance with the license agreement, and rules and regulations issued by
the town as permitted by applicable law and as amended from time to time.
      (4)   Interconnection: A cable system must be able to permit competitor
interconnect and sharing in the capacity and/or transmission of “EG” channels
and the emergency notification system requiring minimal system compatibility
and limited interoperability. Unless otherwise expressly set forth otherwise in
a license agreement, a licensee shall cooperate with other grantees in making
available their signal distribution capabilities if one operator should so
request. The expense of labor and material to effectuate such a juncture shall
be the responsibility of the licensee requiring such services, who shall also
indemnify and hold harmless the furnishing licensee from all damages and
liabilities whatsoever stemming from the requesting grantee's use thereof.
Further, unless otherwise expressly exempted in a license agreement, a licensee
shall interconnect its system with any or all other systems located in the town
upon the request of the town, provided that the town shall not require a
licensee to interconnect with other systems if the town and the licensee
reasonably determine that such interconnect is technically and economically
infeasible. Upon receiving the request of the town to interconnect, a licensee
shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system or
systems in order that technical details are resolved and that costs may be
shared on an equitable basis.
      (5)   Co-location and joint trenching: see construction standards in §
118.33.
   (B)   The town may require that a license exceed the minimum requirements
set forth in division (A) if so designated in the license.
   (C)   The town may waive minimum requirements set forth in division (A)
where the applicant demonstrates that a waiver is in the public interest or is
unduly burdensome to the operation of their system.

366-05, passed 3-7-2005)
§ 118.28 LICENSE APPLICATION AND PROCESSING FEES.
   (A)   Application fee: Each application for a license to be granted under
the authority of this chapter shall be accompanied by a non-refundable filing
fee in the amount specified below, by a certified or cashier's check made
payable to the town. Nonrefundable filing fees for initial license, transfer or
change of ownership, license and modification (see the Town of Florence
Schedule of Fees).
   (B)   A licensee, fee: The licensee shall pay the town no less than 5% of
the licensee's gross revenues from all sources attributable to operations of
the licensee within its license area during the period of its license. A
licensee must pay the license fee due to the town for the preceding quarter
within 30 days of the end of that quarter.
   (C)   Processing fee: As stated in §
118.25(J), to recover the town's expense in reviewing license applications,
every license application is subject to a license processing fee in an amount
not to exceed the town's reasonable costs, less the amount of the application
filing fee. The processing fee is the cost associated with reviewing and
processing the application and license request. Within 30 days of the date the
grant of the license is approved by the Council, the town must notify the
approved applicant of the amount of the license acceptance fee and its methods
of calculation.
   (D)   Any payment of license fees to adjust for a shortfall in the quarterly
payments for the preceding year must be made no later than the filing date for
the annual financial statements as specified in division (D) of this section.
An adjustment for any overpayment will be credited in one or more subsequent
quarterly payments as determined appropriate by the Finance Director.
   (E)   Unless a license agreement provides otherwise, a licensee must file
with the town within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter, a
comprehensive report including a current financial statement showing the gross
revenues received by the licensee during the preceding quarter and the number
of subscribers.
   (F)   A licensee must file within 45 days of the end of its fiscal year, the
licensee's or the licensee parent's annual financial statements for the
preceding year audited by a certified public accountant. The licensee will bear

calculation of gross revenues, and recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under the license. The reasonable cost of the audit, up to the amount
determined to be due to the town, will be borne by the licensee if the annual
payment to the town for the preceding year is increased by more than 5% as a
result of the audit.
   (H)   In the event that a license payment is not received by the town on or
before the due date, the payment shall be deemed delinquent, and subject to a
late fee. The licensee will pay a late charge of 5% of the amount of the
payment, and interest will be charged from the due date at the annual interest
rate then charged for unpaid federal income taxes. Interest and late charges
will not be imposed for any payment necessary as a result of the yearly
adjustment provided for in division (B) of this section, if the payment to
correct for a shortfall does not exceed 10% of the total payments made during
the year. In the event such payment exceeds 10% of the total payments made
during the year, the licensee will be liable for interest and late charges for
the entire amount due. Licensee shall be responsible for payment or
reimbursement of audit expenses.
   (I)   When a license terminates for any reason, the licensee must file with
the town within 90 days of the date the license operations stop an audited
financial statement showing the gross revenues received by the licensee since
the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments must be made at that time for
license fees due to the date that the licensee's operations ceased.

§ 118.33 CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   It is the policy of the town to require construction of cable systems
designed to serve subscribers in an area licensed by the town as rapidly and
expeditiously as possible. The licensee shall diligently pursue and obtain all
necessary permits from the appropriate governmental agencies, utility
companies, and others as necessary to comply with the provisions of this
chapter and other federal, state and town laws, codes, ordinances and
resolutions.
   (B)   A cable system shall be constructed pursuant to a construction
timetable specified in the license agreement.
   (C)   The town may require licensee to report on construction progress and
provide information showing how the construction schedule is being met.
   (D)   Prior to commencement of construction of the system, the licensee
shall provide the technical specifications, in adequate detail, to be utilized
in the construction of the proposed cable system. At such time that the
licensee applies for a permit to construct a portion of the system, the
licensee shall submit to the Public Works Department, a detailed site plan or
map showing the proposed location of that portion of the system and the
relationship of that portion of the system to all existing roadway systems,
with sufficient information for the Public Works Department to issue the right-
of-way permit, and to inspect the work being performed in the public easements
and public rights-of-way. Upon completion, the applicant shall file “as-built”
plans with the town in both hard copy and, if requested by the town, electronic
mapping format compatible with the town's current electronic mapping format, to
the extent that the provider has such capability, showing the detailed location
of all underground cable plant and active electronics, including but not
limited to, all transmitting and receiving pickup locations, the fiber and
coaxial plant, and coaxial amplifiers and pedestal locations.
   (E)   A licensee must use, with the owner's permission, existing poles,
conduits or other facilities whenever possible. Copies of agreements for use of
poles, conduits or other facilities must be filed with the town as required by
the license agreement.
   (F)   All transmission lines, equipment and structures, including poles,
shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights
and reasonable convenience of property owners.
   (G)   Suitable safety devices and practices as required by local, town,
state and federal laws, regulations, and permits must be used during
construction, maintenance, and repair of a cable system.
   (H)   A licensee must remove, replace, or modify at its own expense, any of
its facilities in a public right-of-way when the town requires it to do so, to
allow the town to change, maintain, repair or improve a public thoroughfare as
long as such requirement also applies to all other utilities including
telephone electric and gas.
   (I)   The licensee must put the cable underground at its expense on streets
and roads where both electrical and telephone utility wiring are underground,
and must move the cable underground after initial installation when electrical
and telephone utility wiring are moved underground. The licensee must put the
cable underground between a street or road and a subscriber's residence if both
electrical and telephone utility wiring are underground. A licensee may install
aerial cables if either electric or telephone utility underground installation
is unavailable and licensee agrees to pay any additional costs for licensees
permits for such aerial installation.
   (J)   A licensee must obtain any required permits before starting
construction work on public and private property and must restore the public
and private property to their former condition after construction is completed.
The town, or private property owner may, after prior written notice to the
licensee, repair any damage done by the licensee at the licensee's expense if
restoration is not satisfactorily performed within a reasonable time.
   (K)   Subject to the supervision and direction of the town, a licensee may
trim trees within public rights-of-way at its own expense as necessary to
protect its wires and facilities. A licensee may trim trees on private property
with the consent of the property owner.
   (L)   At the request of any person holding a valid building moving permit
and upon sufficient notice, the licensee must temporarily raise, lower or cut
its wires as necessary to facilitate a move. The direct expense of these
temporary changes, including standby time, must be paid by the permit holder.
The licensee may require payment in advance.
   (M)   Co-location and joint trenching:
      (1)   Licensee shall cooperate with other communications providers in
making available its signal distribution capabilities if another operator or
the town should so request. The expense of labor and material to effectuate
such juncture shall be the responsibility of the party requiring such services,
who shall indemnify and hold harmless the furnishing licensee from all damages
and liabilities whatsoever stemming from the requesting licensee's use thereof.
      (2)   Licensee shall cooperate with the town and all other persons with
authority from the town to occupy and use the public rights-of-way in the
coordination and construction activities and joint-trenching projects, and
shall provide the town with a proposed construction schedule in, around or that
may affect the public rights-of-way. The Town Engineer shall coordinate all
construction locations, activities, and schedules to minimize public
inconvenience, disruption, or damage to the public rights-of-way of the town.
      (3)   A licensee shall utilize, after obtaining the owner's permission,
existing poles, conduits or such other facilities whenever feasible and shall
make its own facilities available for other licensees or other users of the
streets on reasonable terms. Nothing in this section, however, shall be
interpreted as to grant the right to use any existing easement or to utilize
any poles, conduits, easements, or other facilities without the owner's
permission. Underground streets, sidewalk and driveway crossings not using
existing conduits shall be bored unless specific town approval is received. A
copy of written authorization for any licensee to use facilities other than
their own shall be made available for review with the town within five business
days after the request. The licensee may install its own poles only when
approved by the town and then subject to whatever reasonable terms and
conditions the town requires.

§ 118.34 TECHNICAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Guidelines for system facilities, equipment, and services. The
following performance guidelines shall serve as the initial minimum guidelines
for the design, installation, maintenance and operation of the system:
      (1)   Compliance with FCC rules.
         (a)   The system shall meet FCC requirements as set forth in (but not
limited to) 47 C.F.R. Part 76 or as amended. If federal law is subsequently
amended or minimum technical specifications are no longer mandated by the FCC,
the technical specifications in effect at the time of adoption of the license
agreement shall govern.
         (b)   Should the FCC promulgate amended technical requirements which
exceed the performance guidelines set forth within this license agreement,
licensee shall operate its system in compliance with such FCC requirements.
         (c)   All maintenance performed on the cable system by the licensee
shall be in accordance with FCC regulations governing technical performance and
operating standards, currently in effect or hereinafter amended.
      (2)   Continuous 24-hour operation. The system shall operate continuously

except immediately following extraordinary storms which adversely affect
utility services or which damage major system components to the extent
technically feasible under the circumstances.
      (3)   Scheduled testing. For any scheduled testing of the system which
causes any substantial interruption to subscriber's service, the licensee must
make reasonable efforts to notify subscribers within 30 days prior to such
testing and possible interruption. This notification includes but is not
limited to notification by character generator on the cable system, or
neighborhood flyers in the areas to be tested. Insofar as feasible, licensee
shall voluntarily interrupt the provision of cable service only with good cause
and for the shortest time possible during periods of minimum cable system use.
      (4)   Testing for compliance with FCC standards. Following construction

not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
      (7)   Emergency override. The system shall be installed and operated with
an emergency alert system in compliance with the rules of the Federal
Communications Commission and the state “Emergency Alert System Operation Plan
(“state plan”),” as amended from time to time, provided, however, that,
notwithstanding any such FCC or state rules, the system shall be configured
such that, in the event of a local emergency as reasonably determined by the
town, the town shall be able to interrupt, to the extent not prohibited by FCC
regulations or the state plan, audio and video signals distributed over the
system for the delivery of appropriate signals necessitated by such emergency.
The emergency override system will be operated in accordance with the license

§ 118.35 SECURITY DEPOSIT.
   (A)   The license must post with the town a security deposit, performance
bond, or irrevocable letter of credit in the amount specified in the license
agreement before the license is effective. The town must hold the security
deposit as security for:
      (1)   Faithful performance of all applicable provisions of law and the
license agreement;
      (2)   Compliance with all orders, permits, and directions of the town;
and
      (3)   Payment by the licensee of any claims, liens, or taxes due to the
town because of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.
   (B)   The town shall place any such security deposit in an interest bearing
account such as those in which the town general funds are located. The interest
will accrue to the benefit of the licensee but may not be withdrawn. All
interest is added to and becomes part of the original security deposit during
the term of the license.
   (C)   The town may immediately withdraw an appropriate amount, including
interest and penalties, from the security deposit if:
      (1)   After ten days notice the licensee fails to pay to the town any
fees or taxes due and unpaid, damages, or costs or expenses that the town is
compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the licensee in connection
with this license, unless licensee contests the matter within the ten-day
notice period; or
      (2)   After 30 days notice to the licensee, the licensee fails to comply
with any provision of the license that the town reasonably determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of the security deposit. The town must promptly
notify the licensee of the amount and date of any withdrawal.
   (D)   No automatic replenishment. If the amount is contested then there
needs to be a resolution of that issue first. The parties shall agree to
negotiate in good faith about any replenishment should the initial security
fund be depleted.
   (E)   The town must return the security deposit to the licensee after the
license is terminated if there is no outstanding default or unpaid amounts owed
to the town by the licensee.
   (F)   The rights reserved to the town with respect to the security deposit
are in addition to all other rights of the town under this chapter or other
law. An action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to the security
deposit does not affect any other right the town may have.
(Prior Code, Ch. 18, Art. V, § 18-318) (Ord. 343-04, passed 6-21-2004; Ord.

town may declare the licensee in default, which declaration must be in writing.
In the event that the town declares licensee in default, the town shall have
the right to institute legal proceedings to collect damages from the date of
declaration of default, or to exercise any other rights and remedies afforded
to the town in law or equity, provided, however, that the town may institute
revocation proceedings against licensee only after declaration of default,
pursuant to division (F) and only on the grounds set forth therein.
   (C)   Hearing available to licensee. Within 15 days after receipt of a
written declaration of default from the town, licensee may request, in writing,
a hearing before the town or its agent, in a full public proceeding affording
due process. The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the receipt of the
request therefore and a decision rendered within ten days after the conclusion
of the hearing. Any decision shall be in writing and shall be based upon
written findings of fact.
   (D)   Appeal of default. Licensee may appeal a declaration of default to
arbitration.

of either the town or licensee.
      (4)   At the close of the hearings and within 30 days, the arbitrators

         (b)   The arbitrators fail to select a third arbitrator;
         (c)   One or more arbitrator is unqualified;
         (d)   Designated time limits have been exceeded;
         (e)   The arbitrators have not proceeded expeditiously; or
         (f)   Based upon the record, the arbitrators' decision is arbitrary,

based upon a mistake of law.
         (g)   All costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties
to the arbitration unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrators.
   (F)   Revocation. The town may revoke the license only after declaration of

chapter.
   (G)   Procedures governing revocation.
      (1)   The town shall give written notice to the licensee of its intent to
revoke the license and the lawful grounds therefore. Licensee shall have 30
days from such notice to object, in writing, and to state its reasons for such
objection. In the event the town has not received a response satisfactory to
it, it may then proceed to place its request for termination of the license at
a Council meeting. The town shall cause to be served upon the licensee, at
least ten days prior to the time and place of such meeting, a written notice of
this intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting,
notice of which shall be published by the town at least once, ten days before
such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the town.
      (2)   In addition to the licensee's right to appeal any declaration of
default to arbitration under this section, if the town orders the termination
of the license, the licensee shall have the right to appeal the determination
of the town within 30 days to any agency or court of competent jurisdiction for
de novo review. The town's determination to terminate the license shall not be
effective pending final resolution of all appeals under this section.

626(a)—(g) of the Cable Act, the licensee must notify the town, at least 30
months and no more than 36 months before the license expiration date. When the
town receives a notice from the licensee, or at any time at the town's own
initiative, the town shall take the following actions:
      (1)   The town shall review and evaluate the future cable-related
community needs and interests and the licensee's past performance. The review

to provide the services, facilities, and equipment in its proposal; and
      (4)   The cable operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future
cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of
meeting the needs and interests.
   (C)   If a preliminary decision is made that a license should not be
renewed, at the request of the licensee or on its own initiative, the town must

Cable Act. The town must hold one or more public hearings or provide some other
procedure for public comment on the proposal. After the public hearing or
comment period, the Town Manager must recommend that the Council grant or deny
the license renewal and the terms and conditions of any recommended renewal. A
denial under this division shall not affect licensee's renewal rights under
Sections 626(a)—(g) of the Cable Act.

followed the renewal process and paid the renewal fee. The town shall notify
the licensee of the amount of the renewal fee and procedures for renewal.

recommendation of the Town Manager and with the approval of the Council,

cable system in the same manner required by the town for a renewal or new
license.
   (D)   The town shall have 120 days following the submission of the
application for transfer to render a decision. At the discretion of the Town
Manager, the town shall conduct a public hearing (if necessary) and if the town
does not render a decision within 120 days, the transfer shall be deemed
approved.

license agreement.

Manager and with the approval of the Council, for failure to construct,
operate, or maintain the cable system as required by this chapter or the
license agreement, or for some other material breach of this chapter or the
license agreement. If the town has issued a license specifically conditioned
upon the completion of construction or other specific obligations by a
specified date under §
118.35(C), failure of the licensee to complete construction or comply with
other specific obligations as required will result in the automatic forfeiture
of the license without further action by the town. However, the town, at its
discretion and for good cause shown by the licensee, may grant an extension of
time. The town must give a licensee written notice that it is in material
breach of this chapter or the license agreement. If the licensee does not
correct the breach within 30 days of the notice, or corrective action is not
being actively and expeditiously pursued, the town may give written notice to
the licensee of its intent to revoke the license. The town must give the
licensee written notice of the basis for a revocation, stating its reasons.
   (B)   The Council must hold a public hearing, and then determine by written
resolution whether or not to revoke the license based the recommendations of
the Town Manager, information presented at the public hearing, and other
evidence in the record. The resolution must include reasons for the Council's
decision.
   (C)   The town may revoke any license 120 days after an assignment for the
benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over
the business of the licensee, whether in a receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or
proceeding. The town must hold a public hearing before revoking a license under
this division. The town may not revoke a license under this division if, during
the 120-day period:
      (1)   The assignment, receivership, or trusteeship is vacated; or
      (2)   The assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the license agreement and has executed

judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a licensee, by
serving notice on the licensee and the successful bidder at the sale. The
license and all rights and privileges of the license will be revoked 30 days
after the town serves notice under this division unless:
      (1)   The town has approved a transfer of the license; and by the terms
and conditions of the license.
      (2)   The successful bidder has agreed with the town to assume and be
bound by the terms and conditions of the license.

abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers, the town may:
      (1)   Require the former licensee to remove its facilities and equipment
at the licensee's or surety's expense, or at the expense of both, after
determining that the cable system cannot be economically maintained and
operated;
      (2)   Acquire ownership of the cable system at an equitable market price
on the recommendation of the Town Manager and with the approval of the Council;
      (3)   After a public hearing, sell, assign, or transfer all or part of

obtainable. However, the legal, character, financial, technical, and other
qualifications of the purchaser must meet town approval. The town must pay any
consideration received in excess of the town's costs, and after other creditors
and subscriber claims have been satisfied, to the original licensee.

366-05, passed 3-7-2005)
§ 118.41 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE MANDATORY.
   (A)   It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services
from the licensee if their financial and other obligations to the licensee are
satisfied.
   (B)   If the license is terminated, the licensee must do everything in its
power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service.
The licensee must cooperate with the town to operate the system for a
transition period following termination as necessary to maintain continuity of
service to all subscribers. The transition period must not exceed 12 months
without the licensee's written consent. During the transition period, the cable
system must be operated under terms and conditions to which the town and the
licensee agree, or on such other terms and conditions that will continue, to
the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and that will
provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator.
   (C)   If the licensee discontinues service to its subscribers without town
approval, the license may be terminated immediately, and the town may take
possession of all facilities and property, real and personal, related to the
cable system for the purpose of operating the system. The town may undertake
such operation itself or authorize operation by a contractor.

comply with this chapter or its license agreement shall result in injuries to
the town and the residents, businesses and institutions of the town, the

commercial establishment selling aerosol paint containers, paint sticks or
broad-tipped markers shall store the containers, sticks or markers in an area

markers in an area not accessible to the public in the regular course of
business without employee assistance.

misdemeanor crime punishable by jail of up to 30 days and/or a fine of up to
$500 plus surcharges.”
         (b)   Place a sign in the direct view of such persons responsible for
accepting customer payment for graffiti implements stating: “Selling spray
paint, paintball guns, paint sticks or broad tipped markers to persons under 18

surcharges and/or up to 30 days of jail time.”
      (2)   The town shall provide the signage to merchants at no cost; for

(Ord. 483-08, passed 6-2-2008) Penalty, see §
134.99
§ 134.06 GRAFFITI AS A NUISANCE.
   (A)   The existence of graffiti on public or private property in violation
of this chapter is expressly declared to be a public nuisance and, therefore,
is subject to the removal and abatement provisions in this chapter.
   (B)   It is the duty of both the owner of the property to which the graffiti
has been applied and/or the responsible parties to at all times keep the
property clear of graffiti.
(Ord. 483-08, passed 6-2-2008)
§ 134.07 REMOVAL OF GRAFFITI BY PROPERTY OWNER, RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR TOWN.
   (A)   Property owner responsibility. It is unlawful for any person who is
the owner or who has primary responsibility for the control of property or for
repair or maintenance of property in the town, to permit property that is
defaced with graffiti to remain defaced for a period of ten days after service
by first class mail (return receipt requested) of notice of the defacement or
five days after personal service is effected. The notice shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   The street address and legal description of the property sufficient
for identification of the property.
      (2)   A statement that the property is a graffiti nuisance property with
a concise description of the conditions leading to the finding.
      (3)   A statement that the graffiti must be removed within ten days after
receipt of the notice or within five days if personal service is effected, and
that if the graffiti is not abated within that time, the town will declare the
property to be a public nuisance.
      (4)   If personal service or service by mail cannot be effected on the
owner or responsible party, the notice shall then be posted on the property by
the entrance or in a conspicuous location for ten days before the town will
enter the property to effect removal/remediation.
      (5)   Violations of
Ch. 134 of the town code are a Class 3 misdemeanor offense and punishable by a
fine of up to $500 plus 80% surcharges and by up to 30 days in jail.
   (B)   Exceptions of property owner responsibility. The removal requirements
of division (A) shall not apply if the property owner or responsible party can
demonstrate that:
      (1)   The property owner or responsible party lacks the financial ability
to remove the defacing graffiti; or
      (2)   The property owner or responsible party has an active program for
the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the graffiti as part
of that program, in which case it shall be unlawful to permit the property to
remain defaced with graffiti for a period of ten days after service by first
class mail of notice of the defacement or five days if personal service was
effected.
   (C)   Right of town to remove.
      (1)   Use of public funds. Whenever the town becomes aware or is notified
and determines that graffiti is located on publicly- or privately-owned
property viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the town shall be
authorized to use public funds for the removal of the graffiti, or for painting
or repairing of the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to provide
for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than where the graffiti
is located, unless the Town Manager, or the designee of the Town Manager,
determines in writing that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or
repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or
community, or unless the property owner or responsible party agrees to pay for
the costs of repainting or remediating the more extensive area. Any work that
would be valued at more than $250 in materials and labor shall be performed by
a handyman, licensed contractor or by the owner.
      (2)   Right of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private
property, or property owned by a public entity other than the town for the
purpose of graffiti removal, the town shall attempt to secure the consent of
the property owner or responsible party and a release of the town from
liability for property damage or personal injury. If the property owner or
responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time
specified by this chapter, or if the town has requested consent to remove or
paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party
has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the town and consistent
with the terms of this section, the town shall commence abatement and cost
recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to the provisions
specified in the town code.
   (D)   Due process/order to show cause hearings.
      (1)   The Town Attorney may file a petition in the Municipal Court to
compel the removal of graffiti by the property owner and/or responsible party.
Upon filing the petition, the court shall set a hearing within seven days to
determine if the defacement is graffiti, determine if it is a nuisance and
order its removal by the property owner and/or responsible party within 72
hours. The property owner and/or responsible party shall be entitled to present
evidence and argue that the property does not constitute a public nuisance.
Notice shall be served by mailing a copy of the petition and a summons to the
property owner at the address where the graffiti is located or at the address
to which the most recent tax bill has been mailed, if different. If the
property owner of record or the responsible party cannot be found after a
diligent search, the notice shall be posted on the property by an entrance or
conspicuous place for ten days. The Town Magistrate, upon determining graffiti
exists and is a nuisance, shall issue an order for the remediation of the
graffiti and, within ten days of the order, the town will enter the property
and abate the graffiti.
      (2)   The judgment entered after the hearing may be appealed to the
Superior Court in the same manner as established for the appeal of other
Municipal Court judgments.
(Ord. 483-08, passed 6-2-2008) Penalty, see §
134.99
§ 134.08 DISCRIMINATORY/OBSCENE GRAFFITI; FAST TRACK REMOVAL.
   (A)   Graffiti that is offensive to community standards under an objective,
of the standard of a reasonable person, that consists of verbiage or symbols
that demean or denigrate racial groups, ethnic groups, cultural groups or
depict obscene images, shall be removed/abated within 72 hours of notice to the
property owner or responsible party. Town personnel may assist with materials
and supplies to remove or repair the defacement as part of a graffiti abatement
program funded by the town. Failure to remove graffiti by the property owner
and/or responsible party is a criminal violation pursuant to §
134.07.
   (B)   The Town Attorney may file a “fast track” petition for the removal of
obscene or discriminatory graffiti in the Municipal Court. The Court shall set
the petition for hearing within 72 hours after the date of filing indicated on
the petition. The Town Attorney may request that enforcement personnel be
directed by the Court to personally serve the property owner or responsible
party with the summons giving notice of the date and time of the hearing. The
Magistrate shall conduct a hearing to determine if the graffiti is obscene or
discriminatory and, if so, shall order its removal by the property owner or
responsible party within 72 hours. The order shall state that if the owner or
responsible party fails to remove the graffiti as ordered by the Court, the
town will abate the graffiti after 72 hours.
(Ord. 483-08, passed 6-2-2008)
§ 134.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Police Chief or his or her designee is authorized to enforce this
chapter.
(Ord. 483-08, passed 6-2-2008)

   (E)   Juveniles that are convicted of violations of this chapter shall be

§ 150.016 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. Because there are some uses, which may be beneficial to have
within certain zones, and because these uses may not be completely compatible
with adjoining or nearby permitted uses if not specifically controlled, this
division permits these uses after certain conditions have been met. The process
outlined here will allow the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council to
review and approve or disapprove applications for these uses. It will also
allow for the modification of an application, if desired, to make it more
harmonious and compatible with adjoining and/or nearby uses.
   (B)   Permitted uses. Only those uses listed in the conditional use section
of each zone, or as otherwise specified in this Development Code, shall be
permitted under the process provided for by this division.
   (C)   Application. Application for a conditional use permit shall be made by
a property owner or authorized agent upon forms provided by the municipality.
All information requested on the application form must be completed before the
application will be processed.
   (D)   Public hearing. After receipt of a completed application form under
this division, including filing fee and list of property owners within 300 feet
of the property, items shall be placed on the Planning and Zoning Commission’s
agenda for public hearing within 60 days after receipt of the application.
   (E)   Notice. Notice of the public hearing before the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall be given in the manner established in §
150.015. In proceedings that are not initiated by the property owner, notice of
the public hearing shall also be mailed to the owners of property within 300
feet of the subject property boundary, as recorded with Pinal County. This
mailing shall occur at least 15 days prior to the public hearing.
   (F)   Action by Commission. Within 35 calender days of the public hearing
under this division, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend
approval, approval with conditions or disapproval of the application. Notice of
the recommendation shall be sent to the Council and the applicant.
   (G)   Review. In reviewing an application for a conditional use permit, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider:
      (1)   The site of the proposed use and the surrounding land uses;
      (2)   Access to the site; and
      (3)   The impact on adjoining and surrounding property if the application
is approved.
   (H)   Conditions. In making its recommendation, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may include conditions which are deemed necessary to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare. These conditions may include, but
are not limited to:
      (1)   Regulation of use;
      (2)   Special yard requirements;
      (3)   Special buffers, fences or walls;
      (4)   Special parking areas;
      (5)   Street dedications and/or improvements or appropriate bonds;
      (6)   Regulation of access points;
      (7)   Sign restrictions;
      (8)   Required maintenance of yard;
      (9)   Regulations of odors, noise, light or other special environmental
factors;
      (10)   Restrictions of hours of activity;
      (11)   Duration of use;
      (12)   Completion of development; and
      (13)   Other conditions which will make the proposed use more compatible
and harmonious with the surrounding land uses. In no case, however, shall these
conditions be less restrictive than those found in the existing zoning
classification.
   (I)   General requirements. In addition to any of the above special
conditions, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council shall impose the
following general requirements on every conditional use permit which is
granted:
      (1)   No conditional use approval shall be final until all conditions
imposed have been met;
      (2)   All of the special conditions shall constitute restrictions which
run with the land and which shall be binding upon the owner of the land,
successors or assigns;
      (3)   The special conditions imposed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and/or Council shall be consented to in writing by the applicant
prior to issuance of a conditional use permit; and
      (4)   The resolution of the Council granting the application together
with all consent forms shall be recorded by the Recorder of the county.
   (J)   Action by Council. Upon receipt of a recommendation under this
division from the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Council shall approve,
approve with conditions or deny the application. Before acting on the
application, the Council may hold a public hearing on the application. If it
does, notice of the hearing will be in compliance with § 150.015. If it does or
does not hold a public hearing, the Council will approve, approve with
conditions or disapprove the application within 30 days of receiving a
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (K)   Protests. If written protests are received to an application filed
under this Development Code, the regulations of §
150.015(E) shall apply.
   (L)   Revocation. The Council, acting on the recommendation of the Planning
and Zoning Commission or on its own, may revoke any conditional use permit for
noncompliance with any of the conditions set forth in the resolution granting
the permit. This revocation shall occur by resolution of the Council after a
public hearing, notice for which shall be in accordance with §
150.015. Written notice of the possibility of revocation shall be mailed to the
applicant or successor not less than 30 days prior to the Council meeting at
which the issue will be discussed. The revocation of a conditional use permit
shall have the effect of denying all rights and privileges granted by the
approval of the conditional use permit.
   (M)   Time limit. If an established time limit for development expires or if
a time limit for the duration of the carrying on of the conditional use has
been established as a condition of approval, the permission for the use shall
be considered to be revoked upon the date of expiration without any
notification to the applicant or successor.
   (N)   Alteration of structures.  Any proposed changes, either additions,
enlargements or modifications of the structures approved in any conditional use
permit or any proposed extension of the uses into areas approved in any permit
shall follow the same process as outlined in this division. No building permit
for any change shall be issued unless the Council has approved the change.
(Prior Code, Ch. 4, Art. I, § 4-14) (Ord. 432-06, passed 6-19-2006; Ord. 689-
20, passed 4-6-2020)
§ 150.017 TEMPORARY USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. Because there are certain uses intended to be temporary in
nature, this section establishes a process for review and approval of certain
uses that are intended to be a limited duration of time and will not
permanently alter the character or physical facilities of the site where they
occur. The process outlined here will allow the Community Development Director
and the Planning and Zoning Commission to review and approve or disapprove
applications for temporary uses. It will also allow for the modification of an
application, if desired, to make it more harmonious and compatible with
adjoining and/or nearby uses.
   (B)   Permitted uses. Only those uses listed in the temporary use section of
each zone, or as otherwise specified in this Development Code, shall be
permitted under the process provided for by this division.
   (C)   Permit procedures.
      (1)   Application. Application for a temporary use permit shall be made
by a property owner or authorized agent upon forms provided by the
municipality. All information requested on the application form must be
completed before the application will be processed. Applicant may apply for
approval of a temporary use not less than 45 days before the use is intended to
begin accompanied by payment of the required fee.
      (2)   Required findings. The decision-making authority (Community
Development Director, Planning and Zoning Commission, or Town Council, as
applicable) may approve an application for a temporary use permit to allow a
temporary use for a period of time, only upon making all of the following
findings:
         (a)   The proposed use will not unreasonably affect or have a negative
impact on adjacent properties, their owners and occupants, or the surrounding
neighborhood, and will not in any other way constitute a nuisance or be
detrimental to the health, safety, peace, comfort, or general welfare of
persons residing or working in the area of such use or to the general welfare
of the town;
         (b)   The proposed use is consistent with a land use permitted by the
present zoning district within which the site is located, or a land use
considered permitted by a zoning district listed in the general plan as being
consistent with the general plan land use designation of the site;
         (c)   The proposed use will not unreasonably interfere with pedestrian
or vehicular traffic or circulation in the area surrounding the proposed use,
and will not create a demand for additional parking that cannot be safely and
efficiently accommodated by existing parking areas; and
         (d)   Appropriate controls are in place that will ensure the premises
will be kept clean, sanitary, free of litter, and all circulation and parking
surfaces will include a suitable dust- controlled surface.
      (3)   Approvals. The Community Development Director may approve an
application for a temporary use permit to allow a temporary use for a period of
time not to exceed 45 days. All temporary use requests for a period of time
exceeding 45 days may be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Temporary use permits shall be valid for a maximum of two years.
      (4)   Conditions. In approving a temporary use permit, the decision-
making authority may impose reasonable conditions deemed necessary to achieve
the findings for a temporary use permit listed above, including but not limited
to:
         (a)   Regulation of vehicular ingress and egress and traffic
circulation;
         (b)   Regulation of dust control surfaces;
         (c)   Regulation of lighting;
         (d)   Regulation of solid waste removal;
         (e)   Regulation of hours, total number of events/duration for the
permit, and other characteristics of operation;
         (f)   Submission of final plans to ensure compliance with conditions
of approval;
         (g)   Requirement of bonds or other guarantees for cleanup or removal
of structure or equipment; and
         (h)   Such other conditions as the decision-making authority may deem
necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this section.
      (5)   Appeals. The Director’s decision may be appealed to the Planning
and Zoning Commission if a written request from the applicant is received by
the Community Development Department within 15 calender days after the
Director’s final decision is rendered. Appeals will be heard, and a final
decision will be rendered by the Planning and Zoning Commission at their next
regular meeting after seven calender days from receipt of the appeal. The
Planning and Zoning Commission’s decision may be appealed to the Town Council
if a written request from the applicant is received by the Community
Development Department within 15 calender days after the Commission’s final
decision. Council’s consideration of the appeal will be scheduled at a time to
be determined by the Town Clerk.
   (D)   Notice. Notice of the proposed temporary use permit shall be posted on
the subject property for a period of 15 days prior to the date scheduled for
final decision of the request. Notice shall also be mailed to property owners
within 300 feet of the property boundaries proposed for the temporary use.
Additional notification may be required at the Community Development Director’s
discretion.
   (E)   Revocation. The decision-making authority may revoke any temporary use
permit for noncompliance with any of the conditions set forth in granting the
permit. This revocation shall occur after a public hearing, notice for which
shall be in accordance with § 150.015. Written notice of the possibility of
revocation shall be mailed to the applicant and property owner not less than 30
days prior to the meeting at which the issue will be discussed. The revocation
of a temporary use permit shall have the effect of denying all rights and
privileges granted by the approval of the use permit.
   (F)   Time limit. If an established time limit for the temporary use permit
expires or if a time limit for the duration of the carrying on of the use has
been established as a condition of approval, the permission for the use shall
be considered to be revoked upon the date of expiration without any
notification to the applicant.
   (G)   Effective dates.
      (1)   Permit period 45 days or less. A temporary use permit issued for 45
days or less shall become effective on the date the permit is approved by the
decision-making authority.
      (2)   Permit period more than 45 days. A temporary use permit for more
than 45 days shall become effective seven days from the date the permit is
approved by the decision-making authority.

§ 150.052 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R1-18).
   (A)   Purpose.  The R1-18 district is intended to promote and preserve the
development of single-family residential neighborhoods. The dominant land use
of this zone should be single-family dwellings with the other allowed uses,

to the size of the R1-18 neighborhood, so as to adequately serve the
neighborhood. Each R1-18 neighborhood should be served by a conveniently
located B-1 business area of a size in proportion to the residential area it
serves. This zone provides for the lowest intensity of land use within the
municipality, excepting the RA-10, RA-4 and R1-R districts. Whenever possible,
the R1-18 zone should be protected from high intensity land uses and zones, and
from heavily traveled transportation routes by areas of land zoned with one of
the transitional zones: R1-6, MFR, MHS or NO.
   (B)   Permitted uses. The following are permitted uses in the R1-18
district:

§ 150.053 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R1-6).
   (A)   Purpose. The R1-6 district is intended to allow for medium density
residential development that is compatible with R1-18 zoning districts.
Numerical restrictions have been kept to a minimum so as to allow as much
flexibility as possible in housing design and still ensure adequate protection
to adjacent R1-18 zoned property. This is a transitional zone and should be
used to separate and protect the R1-18 zone from more intense land uses and
zones and from heavily traveled transportation routes.
   (B)   Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in the R1-6 zone:
      (1)   Dwelling, single-family;
      (2)   Accessory buildings (see §
150.258 for property development standards) and uses, including private
swimming pools and home occupations; and
      (3)   Park, playground and community owned buildings.

operated for commercial purpose), including clubhouse and service facilities
which are intended to primarily serve golf course uses and are no closer than

§ 150.054 NEIGHBORHOOD MULTI-FAMILY (R-2).
   (A)   Purpose. The R-2 district is intended to allow for higher density
residential development that is compatible with the R-1 (single-family) zone.
Numerical restrictions have been kept to a minimum so as to allow as much
flexibility as possible in housing design and still ensure adequate protection
to adjacent R-1 zoned districts. This is a transitional zone and should be used
to separate and protect the R-1 districts from more intense land uses and
zones, and from heavily traveled transportation routes.
   (B)   Permitted uses.  The following uses are permitted in the R-2 zoning
district:
      (1)   Accessory buildings (See §

§ 150.055 MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (MFR).
   (A)   Purpose. The MFR district is intended to allow for high density
residential development in close proximity to the downtown commercial center.
This direct relationship provides consumer support for the commercial center
and places necessary services and employment centers within walking distance of
a large number of people. In spite of the high density allowed, the open space
and landscaping requirements of this district are intended to ensure a spacious
residential character.
   (B)   Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in the MFR district:
      (1)   Multiple unit dwellings including apartments, condominiums and town
home housing;

§ 150.056 MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION (MHS).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the manufactured home subdivision zoning
district is intended to encourage unique and creatively developed subdivisions
that are unified by common amenities, operations and associations for the

§ 150.066 OVERLAY DISTRICTS; HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. 
      (1)   It is the purpose of the historic district to promote the
preservation of the unique historical character of the municipality while
encouraging the retention and rehabilitation of historic districts and
individual historic sites or structures in the community. The result of this
preservation and rehabilitation will be to provide for the educational,
cultural, economic and general social benefits which will occur because of the
Code while ensuring an orderly growth for the historic portions of the
community.
      (2)   To achieve these objectives, the historic district zoning
designation is to be superimposed over existing zoning classifications where
there is a recognized group of historic structures. This zoning designation is
not intended to modify or alter those land uses permitted by the existing,
underlying zoning and should not be used to do so. This zone is, however,
intended to encourage the preservation of historic districts and structures, to
promote their use while retaining their original architectural style and
character and to provide for their rehabilitation, if necessary.
      (3)   It is also the intent of this zone to ensure that proposals for new
or remodeled structures which are to be located within designated historic
districts are designed and constructed to harmonize with the existing historic
structures in the immediate vicinity. Achievement of this objective will assist
in the preservation of the historical character of the district while retaining
the property values within the district. It will also provide for future
development in the district. Finally, achieving this objective will promote an
awareness of the unique historical character of the municipality for both its
residents and visitors.
   (B)   Creation of historic district. Based on the information contained in
Florence Townsite, A.T., the 1982 district nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places, and other pertinent material on the history of the
municipality which has been or will be prepared, the historic sites and
structures of the municipality can be delineated. Based on the findings of
these documents, a historic district may be proposed which will include all or
a portion of these identified historic sites or structures.
      (1)   This proposed historic district may be initiated by the direct
action of the Council or by the Commission. It may also be initiated by the
application of not less than 75% of the owners of property in the proposed
district or by the application of not less than 75% of the owners by area in
the proposed
district. For purposes of this calculation of the number of owners of property
within the proposed district and the amount of property which each owns, the
most recent records of the County Assessor’s office shall be used. Also for
this purpose, a single parcel of property held in joint or common tenancy shall
be counted as one owner and only one of the owners shall have to sign the
application for historic district zoning.
      (2)   In approving an application for historic district zoning, the
Council shall follow the same procedures that are used in other zoning cases.
Before initiating the formation of a historically zoned district, however, the
Council and/or the Commission may seek the advice, assistance and participation
of qualified groups or individuals interested in the preservation and
rehabilitation of the historic sites and structures of the community.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context indicates or requires a different

§ 150.069 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the PUD district is intended to accommodate,
encourage and promote developments with innovative design involving residential
and nonresidential land uses, which together form an attractive, harmonious
unit in the community. Such a planned unit development may be designed as a
large-scale separate entity, able to function as an individual community or
neighborhood, as a small-scale project which requires flexibility because of
unique circumstances or design characteristics or as a transitional area
between dissimilar land uses. The planned unit development, if so specified at
the time of zoning approval, may include standards or criteria that differ from
those regulations pertaining to other districts when warranted by circumstances
such as but not limited to, alternative residential lot design, innovative
architectural or subdivision design features, retirement housing, in-fill
development involving a small or irregularly shaped parcel or other
circumstances found by the town through the PUD approval to merit departure
from the regulations pertaining to other districts. The PUD may be used either
as an overlay district to provide flexibility in an otherwise established land
use district, or it can be used as an independent district. This district,
which may only be developed in accordance with an approved development plan is
further established to provide both the developer and the town with reasonable
assurances that specific, proposed uses, intensities and phasing are consistent
with the adopted general plan.
   (B)   General applicability. The provisions of this Development Code shall
apply to all planned unit development documents and any additional or
supplemental information that is deemed necessary by the Planning Director, or
designee, to meet the following objectives: to accommodate variations in
building design, lot arrangements and land uses for a maximum choice in the
types of environments for residential, commercial, industrial uses and
facilities, to provide for a coordinated and compatibly arranged variety of
land uses with efficient and safe traffic circulation, including the separation
of pedestrian from vehicular traffic through innovative site planning, to
maintain quality of living excellence with the provision of usable open space
standards to minimize adverse environmental impact on surrounding areas and, to
assist in fulfilling the goals, objectives and policies of the town’s general
plan and amendments thereto.
   (C)   Permitted uses. All uses permitted within the PUD district are
determined by the underlying zoning district, or by an approved development
plan for the site. In the development of a balanced community, a variety of
housing within one project shall be deemed most in keeping with the objectives
of this Development Code. All other uses shall be determined by the
compatibility of the uses with each other as well as with surrounding land uses
and shall conform to policies established in the town’s general plan.
   (D)   Density and intensity. Densities and intensities permitted in the PUD
district shall conform with the town’s general plan except as to portions of
the PUD specifically covered by a plan of development, development agreement,
standards or stipulations adopted prior to June 19, 2006.
   (E)   Procedures. A PUD proposal shall be submitted to the Planning Director
in the form of a preliminary development plan consisting of a graphic layout
with accompanying narrative. For small-scale or single phase projects, the PUD
shall be filed as a zoning application and be reviewed and considered for
approval in conjunction with the Committee, Planning and Zoning Commission and
Town Council procedures. For large, multi-phase projects, the zoning
application may be filed as a conceptual preliminary plan with sufficient
description and documentation to identify the nature, mix and general
arrangement, density, open space and quality of the project, which may be
approved upon review by the Committee, Planning and Zoning Commission and Town
Council.
   (F)   Pre-application meeting. A pre-application meeting shall be held
between the owner or owner’s representative(s) and the town. Formal application
shall then be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department, at which time
the application shall be forwarded to the Committee for review and
recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission at a public hearing, in
accordance with §
150.019. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear the case and forward its
recommendation to the Council. Within two years of preliminary PUD approval,
the applicant shall submit the final PUD to the Planning Commission. The
Commission’s recommendations on the final development plan shall be referred to
the Town Council for review and approval. Failure to initiate and complete all
improvements within the time limits stipulated as part of the final PUD
approval shall be cause for the Council to rescind the re-zoning, unless
extension of time is granted by the Council.
   (G)   Preliminary application. A preliminary PUD (showing general land use
concepts, but not requiring lotting plans at this stage) shall be submitted to
and reviewed by the Planning Director, or designee, for consistency with town
codes, policies and plans and shall indicate the following:
      (1)   Locational information including an area map showing adjacent
property ownership and existing uses within 300 feet of the parcel, and a legal
description of the metes and bounds of the parcel;
      (2)   Physical constraints to the site’s development: existing
topographical features, including any portions of the site that are subject to
flooding (indicating the extent and frequency, retention areas, calculations
and maintenance responsibility), proposed roadway or major utility line
extensions which may impact development and areas within aircraft approach and
holding patterns and the other impediments to the property’s use and
improvement as may be present or planned for the future;
      (3)   Proposed site development addressing the location and nature of the
various uses and their areas in acres (summarizing land use areas, total number
of dwelling units and approximate percentage allocation by dwelling type,
calculation of the residential density in dwelling units per gross acre as
defined in the general plan;
      (4)   The proposed circulation system, including any improvements (public
or private) needed to accommodate additional traffic;
      (5)   The open space system (including a general statement regarding
ownership and maintenance) with indication of responsiveness to general plan
recreation and/or open space and perimeter treatments;
      (6)   Relationship of the project to surrounding land uses; and
      (7)   Evidence of proposed land use compatibility with existing and
projected community requirements, with the goals of the general plan.
   (H)   Preliminary review. The preliminary PUD shall be reviewed by the Town
Planning Department with staff comments forwarded to the Committee as well as
any other agencies deemed appropriate by the Department. The Department shall
compile and forward written comments within 30 days.
   (I)   Waiver. The Planning Director or designee, in writing, may waive any
of the above required information which is not applicable or require additional
information when necessary to clarify any aspect of the project or its
potential impacts on the community.
   (J)   Committee review. The Committee shall conduct a meeting to review and
make a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission of the findings.
   (K)   Planning and Zoning Commission review. Thereafter, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the preliminary PUD and
transmit recommendations to the Town Council for review.
   (L)   Town Council review. The Town Council may adopt the recommendations of
Planning and Zoning Commission without holding a second public hearing if there
is no objection, request for public hearing or protest pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-
462.04(D). The Council shall hold a public hearing if requested by the
applicant, any person appearing in opposition at the Commission hearing or who
has filed a written protest, or any member of the Town Council.
   (M)   Town Council approval. The Town Council may approve a PUD only upon
finding that the proposal meets the intent, objectives and general requirements
of the PUD district and is in conformance with the town general plan,
amendments thereto and all pertinent codes and policies.

initial development phases, for preliminary plat approval within two years from
Council adoption.
   (N)   Final approval. Final PUD review and approval, may be processed
simultaneously with preliminary plat review. The plans required under this
Development Code may be submitted in a form which satisfies the requirements of
the subdivision regulations for final plat approval if submitted at the same
time. Portions of the PUD which are intended for development at later stages,
one year or more from the date of approval, shall not be required to show
precise lot or site dimensions but shall be individually processed prior to the
issuance of development permits. The applicant shall submit 25 copies of the
final development plan, not less than 11 inches by 17 inches in dimension, and
one color transparency to the Planning and Zoning Department containing the
following information, unless specifically provided otherwise:

§ 150.070 TERRITORY SQUARE (TS).
   (A)   Adoption. The territory square zoning district zoning book is adopted
by reference.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of the territory square zoning district is to
allow for a more creative and flexible hybrid zoning mechanism that can be
utilized to effectively implement the town-endorsed North End Framework Vision
Plan. This zoning district is intended to accommodate, encourage and promote
high quality and innovative residential, non-residential and mixed use
development within a centralized area of Florence that is critical for the
ultimate connectivity of historic and downtown Florence with suburbanizing
areas of Florence north of the Gila River. Furthermore, the purpose of the
territory square zoning district is to encourage social, physical and economic
advantages resulting from the comprehensive and orderly planned use of land
resources and land development strategies as reflected in the North End
Framework Vision Plan.
   (C)   General applicability.  The provisions of the territory square zoning
district shall apply only to those properties within the indicated boundaries
of the territory square area as indicated within the territory square zoning
district zoning book and as identified as part of the Territory Square MPC
(Master Planned Community) on the town’s general plan future land use map. All
development within the territory square area shall be subject to the provisions
in the territory square zoning district code book, except where applicable
provisions are not expressly stated in the territory square zoning district
code book. In the case of the latter, the town will refer to other applicable
codes within the town's code of ordinances, such as the town's Development
Code.
   (D)   Permitted uses.  Permitted uses within the territory square zoning
district are defined within the territory square zoning district code book.
Furthermore, any municipal use or any infrastructure use necessary to support
development within the territory square area shall be considered a principally
permitted use. Because no list of uses can be exhaustive, interpretations on
unspecified uses shall be rendered by the Community Development Director, with
the right to appeal to the Planning and Zoning Commission and Town Council.
   (E)   Development standards.  Development standards within the territory
square zoning district are defined within the territory square zoning district
code book.
      (1)   Setbacks. Setback ranges are defined within the territory square
zoning district zoning book. Final setbacks for each development block or
subdivision shall conform to the specified ranges and be precisely defined as
each development block or subdivision is processed through the town's
subdivision and/or design review application process. This flexibility affords
increased latitude in establishing setbacks that work best for the type of
development being proposed with each land use group area.
      (2)   Parking. Parking shall be in compliance with applicable sections of
the town's Development Code, except that community or municipal parking areas
will be encouraged within the core land use group and the town, upon review,
may approve the usage of alternative parking surfaces. Parking deviations from
the town's Development Code can be proposed for consideration by the Planning
and Zoning Commission by means of a design review application process.
      (3)   Roadways.  The Town Engineer shall be allowed to consider, and
where appropriate, approve alternate roadway development standards as indicated
within the territory square zoning district zoning book or as proposed as part
of a subdivision or design review application.
      (4)   Signs.  General language regarding the character of signage is
indicated in the territory square zoning district zoning book. Signage cannot
deviate from or exceed that allowed by town code, except as may be allowed by
comprehensive sign plans for territory square approved through the design
review process. Comprehensive sign plans may apply by land use group or
development blocks within a land use group.
      (5)   Design review.  All future development shall be subject to the
town's design review process, which shall consider, amongst other things, site
design, architectural designs, building materials, lighting, parking,
landscaping, grading, drainage, access, circulation, building colors, signage,
building locations, buffering, sanitation, walls, fences, fire protection and
compatibility with surrounding properties. Design review approval is required
prior to the issuance of building permits for the site.
   (F)   Density and intensity.  Densities and intensities permitted in the
territory square zoning district shall conform to those set forth within the
territory square zoning district zoning book.
   (G)   Procedures.  Application of the territory square zoning district to
properties shall be subject to the rezoning process as defined with the town's
code of ordinances and per applicable state statutes. Amendments to the
territory square zoning district code book shall be processed as text
amendments to the town's Development Code.

shall be screened and oriented in a manner as to not be visible from the
adjacent public streets. Call box speakers shall be directed away from adjacent
residential zoned land and residences. The maximum aggregate sign area for both
signs (per lane) shall not exceed 50 square feet or a maximum height of eight
feet per sign. These signs shall not be included in calculating the total
aggregate sign area for signage allowed on a parcel, lot or for a particular
business.

PART 7. PARKING; LOADING AND UNLOADING
§ 150.156 PARKING; LOADING AND UNLOADING.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to minimize congestion on
public streets, provide minimum requirements for off-street vehicle parking
facilities, and to promote the safety and welfare of the public.
   (B)   Requirements for off-street parking.
      (1)   No building permit shall be issued until the applicant has
presented satisfactory evidence to the Community Development Director or
designee, that he or she owns or has otherwise available for his or her use,
sufficient property to provide required parking, required landscaping, and
other site improvements required by this code.
      (2)   No additions to or enlargement of an existing building or use shall
be permitted unless parking requirements are met for the entire building or
use.
      (3)   For new buildings, building expansion or conversions, and changes
of use, plans must show the arrangement of required parking spaces, and
indicate sufficient space for turning and back-up maneuvers, refuse screening,
and adequate ingress and egress by patrons and delivery vehicles to the parking
area before a permit is granted. Plans shall be submitted to scale and fully
dimensioned to the Community Development Director or designee, for approval
prior to the permit being granted.
      (4)   When the use of an existing building, structure, or premises is
changed such that the change requires an increase in the total number of
required parking spaces for the parcel of greater than 10% or 20 spaces,
whichever is greater, then such additional parking spaces and parking and
loading areas shall be provided for the entire building, structure, or premises
either on the premises or by joint off-site parking agreement. When the use of
any existing building, structure, or premises is changed such that an increase
in parking spaces is less than 10% of the total required for the site or 20
spaces, whichever is less, then the change of use or intensity is exempt from
the requirements of this section related to parking quantities.
      (5)   All parking and loading spaces, maneuvering areas, driveways, and
fire lanes shall be paved with asphaltic concrete; pavers; cement concrete;
penetration treatment of bituminous material and seal coat of bituminous binder
and a mineral aggregate; and/or a stabilization method approved by the town.
Through the site plan and design review process, the town may permit up to 20%
of the required parking to be of a pervious surface to reduce heat-island and
run-off effects. All parking surfaces must be designed to a sufficient
thickness to withstand repeated vehicular traffic and receive approval from the
Town Engineer.
      (6)   All vehicular egress from parking lots to public rights-of-way
shall be by forward motion only, except in the case of single-family and two-
family residences fronting on a local street or a primary or secondary
collector street.
      (7)   Tandem arrangement of required parking spaces is prohibited, except
as otherwise permitted by this Development Code.
      (8)   The use of an off-street parking space for the storage of
merchandise, supplies, equipment, vehicles for sale or rent, vehicles used for
business identification signage, or for repair of vehicles, is prohibited. The
temporary use of on-site parking spaces for the purposes of construction
staging may be permitted in conjunction with an active building permit. Minimum
required on-site parking spaces shall be maintained for all active uses for the
duration of construction. A vehicle for sale may be parked in an approved
residential parking space for non-commercial purposes, for a period not to
exceed 30 days. No more than one vehicle may be advertised for sale on the same
residential property during a period of one year.
      (9)   All parking areas and landscaping shall be maintained in good
condition. Maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, fixing potholes,
filling cracks, landscaping, and maintaining the appearance of the parking
area.
      (10)   Construction of required parking areas shall be completed in
accordance with this section prior to commencement of the use or occupancy of
the parcel, building, or structure.
   (C)   Parking standards for multi-family, non-residential, mixed-uses, and
PUDs.
      (1)   Uses computed separately. In case of multiple uses on a site, the
total requirements for off-street parking space shall be the sum of the
requirements of the various uses computed separately.
      (2)   Maintenance. It shall be the joint and separate responsibility of
the lessee and owner of the principal use, uses, or building to maintain in a
neat and adequate manner, the parking space, access ways, striping,
landscaping, and required fences or screening.
      (3)   Parking area improvements. For multi-family residential,
commercial, industrial, and PUD districts, the following shall apply:
         (a)   Parking areas shall be screened from street view and residential
development by a berm and/or wall (minimum of three feet in height), with
landscaping;
         (b)   Lights illuminating a parking space shall be arranged and
shielded to reflect light away from adjoining residences and streets. Light
standards shall be a maximum height of 24 feet. Refer to §
150.090 for additional parking area lighting requirements; and
         (c)    Except where a wall is required, a minimum six-inch high curb
or permanently attached or affixed bumper guard shall be constructed so that no
part of a vehicle extends beyond the property line.

      (4)   Access. Off-street parking spaces shall be connected with a public
street by a paved driveway, which affords safe and reasonably convenient
ingress and egress. The minimum width of driveways shall be 40 feet where
ingress and right and left turn egress is proposed. If only a single ingress
and egress lane is proposed, the minimum width required shall be 32 feet. If
ingress and egress are by separate drives, then the minimum width of each drive
shall be 20 feet.
      (5)   Parking space location. All required parking spaces for non-
residential or mixed uses shall be located on the lot upon which the use is
located or on an adjacent lot. Required parking spaces for multi-family,
commercial, or industrial use may be located on an adjacent lot in another
district (other than in a single-family residential district).
      (6)   Joint use parking for mixed use or PUD.
         (a)   If an applicant for a mixed use PUD or in any multi-family or
employment/commercial district can demonstrate through a parking study supplied
by the applicant and approved by the Community Development Director or
designee, that the peak parking demand for the mixed uses will be less than the
sum of the parking spaces required for each use served, a reduction in spaces
may be allowed.
         (b)   The approved joint use parking plan shall specify the typical
hours of operation with anticipated periods of greatest parking demand for all
uses within the development, and shall indicate the number, location, and
convenience of pedestrian access of all spaces available to serve each use.
         (c)   The joint use parking plan shall remain on file with the town
for the purpose of monitoring the continued adequacy of available parking.
         (d)   At the time of joint use parking plan approval, or at any
subsequent time when uses, intensities of use, or hours of operation may be
expanded or otherwise changed, or upon findings that the parking facilities are
inadequate, the Community Development Director or designee may require
additional site area to be provided, and as necessary, improved to supply
additional parking facilities.
         (e)   Joint use parking plans shall include the necessary perpetual
cross-access and shared parking easements as required by the town and recorded
in a form approved by the Town Attorney. Any request for reduction of minimum
required parking shall be substantiated by calculations based on Urban Land
Institute (ULI) standards and in a manner acceptable to the town.
         (f)   Off-site parking areas may be approved by the Community
Development Director if the parking area is within 300 feet of the associated
business or use as part of a development plan when it can be demonstrated to be
of benefit to the public interest.
   (D)   Parking standards for single-family and two-family residential uses.
      (1)   Parking space location. All residential parking spaces shall be
paved or surfaced in a manner approved by the Town Engineer. Each residential
unit shall have a driveway not less than 18 feet in length, as measured from
the back of the sidewalk. If no sidewalk exists, the driveway length shall be
measured from the back of the curb. No vehicle shall be parked in a manner to
encroach within the right-of-way or obstruct the sight visibility of a sidewalk
or right-of-way in accordance with the town’s engineering standards.
      (2)   Parking space allocation and/or improvement standards. Requirements
and directions for the allocation and design of parking spaces in all
residential districts are described for various land uses in division (F).
   (E)   Parking standards; calculations. Calculations to determine the
required number of parking spaces, and the design of the space shall consider
the following.
      (1)   Minimum standards for parking space allocation shall be subject to
the requirements of this Development Code.
      (2)   The maximum number of parking spaces provided shall not exceed the
minimum number of spaces required plus an additional 20% of parking spaces,
except as otherwise provided in this Development Code, without specific
approval by the Community Development Director or designee. Parking spaces
exceeding 120% of the minimum required may be approved at the discretion of the
Planning and Zoning Commission through the design review process.
      (3)   Parking lots shall be designed with a clear hierarchy of
circulation with major access drives providing access from the major street,
major circulation drives forming circulation through the parking area and
parking aisles, whose purpose is to provide access to parking spaces.
      (4)   An agreement for reciprocal access between adjacent commercial
developments is required.
      (5)   Large parking lots shall be divided into a series of smaller lots
of approximately 150 spaces each, using landscape island(s) at least ten feet
in width, and at least 380 square feet in total area, located along the parking
areas to break up large expanses of parking. A hierarchy of drive aisles shall
be used to identify the primary on-site circulation routes from secondary drive
aisles that provide direct access and maneuvering for parking spaces. Walkways
may be located within these landscape areas. Landscape islands at least five
feet wide and at least 95 square feet in total area, shall be located between
spaces at regular intervals and on the ends of parking rows, extending the full
length of parking spaces.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2665.png]
 
   (6)   Diamond shaped tree planters shall be provided in the interior of the
individual parking areas to provide shade. Diamond planters in multi-family,
commercial, office, and industrial developments shall be uniformly distributed
between landscape islands. Such planters shall be a minimum of five square feet
in size, oriented in a diagonal fashion, and shall occur at the following
minimum frequencies:
 
Frequency                                     Type of Development
1 island per 12 spaces                        Multi-family residential
1 island and 2 diamond planters per 15 spaces Commercial
1 island and 2 diamond planters per 15 spaces Office
1 island per 20 spaces                        Industrial
 
      (7)   Parking lots with more than 20 spaces shall provide an equal number
of landscape islands and planters as prescribed above. Refer to §
150.138 for additional parking area landscape requirements. As part of design
review, town staff shall review parking lot and landscape layouts to determine
if they are in keeping with the requirements of this Development Code.
      (8)   Parking areas may be combined and share the required landscape
buffers.
      (9)   Parking lots shall be separated from the sides of buildings by a
raised walkway with a minimum width of six feet.
      (10)   All commercial, office, multi-family, and manufactured home
developments shall provide a minimum six-foot wide sidewalk connection through
the parking lot from the public right-of-way or public sidewalk, where
provided, to the building entry or interior sidewalk network.
      (11)   To provide flexibility in design and development of projects,
additional parking spaces may be considered through the design review process.
The total number of parking spaces may be increased by 10% above the maximum
allowed for each additional 2.5% increase in total landscape area, in addition
to the minimum required landscape area. However, in no case may the total
number of parking spaces be increased by more than 40% above the base maximum
allowed.
            (a)   In the case of fractional results in calculating parking
requirements, the required number shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
number if the fraction is 0.5 or greater.
            (b)   All uses not specifically designated or similar to a
specified use shall have parking space requirements determined by the Community
Development Director or designee.
   (F)   Parking space allocation requirements.
      (1)   General allocation requirements.

PART 9. WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
§ 150.180 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish general requirements for the
installation of wireless communications facilities, including towers and
antennas. The goals of this subchapter are to:
   (A)   Minimize the adverse visual effects of towers through careful design,
siting, and screening, while preserving the rights of wireless
telecommunications providers;
   (B)   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas;
   (C)   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
   (D)   Strongly encourage the joint use (co-location) of new and existing
tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-
use towers;
   (E)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
   (F)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful
design, siting, screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
   (G)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
and
   (H)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.

equipment to be located at the site as of the date of application;
         (c)   Written authorization for the use from the site owner; and
         (d)   Provide the town with a plan for the total build-out in the
town. This allows the town to coordinate tower locations with other applicants.
      (2)   Proof that:
         (a)   Reasonable measures have been taken to assure that the proposed
structure will be placed in a location which will minimize the visual impact on
the surrounding area;
         (b)   The proposed antenna and equipment could not be placed on a
preexisting facility under control of the applicant and function under
applicable regulatory and design requirements without unreasonable
modification;
         (c)   If the application is for siting in a residential area, the area
cannot be adequately served by a facility placed in a non-residential area; and
         (d)   A new tower is designed to accommodate the applicant's potential
future needs, is of suitable construction and should be adapted to allow the
co-location of additional antennae.
      (3)   A written agreement that:
         (a)   The tower and/or antenna shall be removed within 180 days of
cessation of use, and to return the area to its condition prior to the
construction of the tower;
         (b)   The applicant's service is subordinate to essential public
communications services and agreement to suspend use of any site which may be
in conflict with the services, regardless of the reason for the conflict, until
the conflict is resolved; and
         (c)   All applicable health, nuisance, fire and safety codes are met.
If upon inspection, the town determines that a wireless communications facility
fails to comply with the agreements or applicable codes, the owner of the
facility will have 30 days to bring the facility into compliance. Failure to
bring the facility into compliance within 30 days will constitute grounds for
the removal of the facility at the owner's expense.

to carry the peak 100 year flow without endangering life or property outside
the easement or tract; and
      (2)   The easement or tract set aside will accommodate usual maintenance
equipment.
   (D)   Home owners association. If a development will have a property owners
association, then land set aside for surface drainage should be in tracts owned
and maintained by the property owners association and not in an easement (where
maintenance responsibility would be split among several property owners).
   (E)   Identify areas to be used for storm drainage retention or detention.
These areas will be tracts owned and maintained by a property owners
association. Sufficient dimensions and other information must be provided
owners association. Dimensions and other information must be provided to
describe the size of the area, the approximate depth and the slope of the
sides.
   (F)   Layout for water and sewer lines. Show the proposed layout of water
and sewer lines for the development. Indicate the size of the lines and
direction of flow.

direction by arrows and indicate those points where concentrated flow is added
or removed from the street.
   (H)   Bikeways and multi-use trails. Show proposed locations of bikeways and
multi-use trails within the plat boundaries and that must conform to the town's
general plan.
   (I)   Notification of property owner’s association. If the subdivision will
have a property owner's association, indicate this on the plat with an
appropriate statement as it relates to the duties and requirements as outlined
in the CC&R's i.e. the ownership and maintenance of tracts.
   (J)   Notification of private street. If street will be private, indicate
this with a note on the plat, and state that the property owner's association
will maintain streets and any street lights located within the private rights-
of-way.
   (K)   Indicate any temporary cul-de-sacs, infrastructure lines, valves and
the like. If the developer intends to have one recorded plat for the entire
subdivision, but plans to phase the improvements, the plat must have a
statement indicating this and suitable markings showing the proposed phasing.
   (L)   Submit master plan. Submit a master plan for large parcel of land that
will be subdivided with several recorded plats over a period of time.
   (M)   Submit preliminary plat. Submit a preliminary plat for only the first
phase that the developer intends to secure a recorded plat. Submit subsequent
preliminary plats that conform to the approved subdivision or PUD.

   (A)   Utility improvement plan (UIP). In conjunction with the other
engineering plans prescribed in this Development Code, the developer must
provide a UIP that illustrates the physical relationship of all proposed
utility improvements for the proposed subdivision. The intent of this plan is
to cumulatively index all proposed utility improvements for easy reference and
to provide for a coordinated development effort.
   (B)   UIP requirements. At a minimum, the UIP should depict the proposed
location and separation of all public improvements and how they relate to the
lots or blocks of the subdivision. The UIP should provide approximate distances
and measurements of all proposed rights-of-way, easements, 100-year floodplain
limits for regulatory flows, utility placements, edge of pavement, curb, gutter
and sidewalk (if required), drainage structures and the building footprint. The
UIP should be overlaid on a topographic map with a contour interval of not less
than five feet. The topographic mapping should extend 50 feet beyond the
subdivision boundaries. Spot elevations for the proposed grading should be
provided at various locations to assist in determining the suitability of
topography to the proposed subdivision. Finally, if the project is to be
phased, the phase lines must be shown on the UIP. The criteria and requirements
for streets, drainage, water and sewer may be found in §
150.239.

§ 150.234 PERFORMANCE CONTRACT.
   (A)   In order to ensure proper installation of subdivision improvements,
the developer shall designate the type of assurance in a form and method
acceptable to the Town Attorney and approved by Town Council in conjunction
with review of the final plat.
   (B)   A final copy of the assurance shall be submitted to staff within 90
days of Council approval, and prior to the recordation of any final plat
approved by the Town Council. The amount of the assurance shall be based on a
cost estimate prepared by a registered civil engineer in an amount to cover
120% of the complete installation of the improvements. This assurance shall
provide for its forfeiture to the town in the event the improvements are not
accepted by the town by the declared completion date due to the default of the
developer. Any portion of the forfeiture in excess of the expenses incurred by
the town in connection with the installation of the improvements shall be
returned to the developer. The owner must provide the town with one of the
following types of financial assurances for the completion of the construction
of the improvements required for the development of the subdivision:
      (1)   Cash or surety bond. The developer shall deposit with the Town
Clerk cash or a surety bond. The surety bond shall be executed by the developer
with a corporation duly licensed and authorized to transact surety business in
the state, as surety. The bond shall be in favor of the town, shall be
continuous in form and shall require that the total aggregate liability of the
surety for all claims shall be limited to the face amount of the bond,
regardless of the number of years the bond is in force and shall provide that:
         (a)   The bond or cash shall be released upon satisfactory performance
of the work and its acceptance by the Town Council;
         (b)   Progress payments may be made to the developer upon request from
any cash deposit made. The progress payments shall be made in accordance with
standards established by the Town Engineer;
         (c)   The bond may be cancelled by the developer upon 30 days written
notice to the town, provided that other security satisfactory to the town has
been deposited which will cover the obligations of the developer which remain
to be performed; and
         (d)   Any work abandoned or not completed by the developer may be
completed by the town, which shall recover the construction costs from the
developer or the bonding agent.
      (2)   Assurance of construction through loan commitment. In lieu of
providing assurance of construction in the manner provided above, the developer
may provide assurance of construction of all required utility and
infrastructure improvements, by delivering to the town in a manner described
above, an appropriate agreement acceptable to the Town Attorney between an
approved lending institution and the developer which provides a statement that
funds sufficient to cover the entire cost of installing the required
improvements, including engineering and inspection costs and the cost of
replacement or repairs of any existing streets or improvements demanded by the
town in the course of development of the subdivision have been deposited with
the approved lending institution by the developer. The agreement shall provide
that the funds in the approved amount are specifically allocated and will be
used by the developer, or on their behalf, only for the purpose of installing
the subdivision improvements. The town shall be the beneficiary of the
agreement or the developer's rights shall be assigned to the town, and the Town
Engineer shall approve each disbursement of the funds. The agreement may also
contain terms, conditions and provisions normally included by the lending
institutions in loan commitments for construction funds, or as may be necessary
to comply with statutes and regulations applicable to the lending institutions.
      (3)   Alternative assurances. In lieu of providing a surety bond or an
agreement between the subdivision developer and an approved lending
institution, the Town Attorney may approve and recommend to Town Council the
alternative assurances that it deems sufficient to guarantee and assure
construction of the required improvements, including a contractual agreement by
an approved lender guaranteeing the performance of the subdivision developer,
or a performance deed of trust, in first lien position, or the other assurances
as the Town Council shall deem sufficient and appropriate.
      (4)   Assurance of warranty. The developer shall warranty all work
against defective workmanship or materials for a period of one year from the
date of its final acceptance.

adopted in the form of impact fee schedules.
   (F)   Administration.
      (1)   Separate accounts. Development impact fees collected pursuant to
this section shall be placed in separate, interest-bearing accounts for each
capital facility category within each service area.
      (2)   Limitations on use of fees. Development impact fees and any
interest thereon collected pursuant to this section shall be spent to provide
capital facilities associated with the same category of necessary public
services in the same service area for which they were collected, including
costs of financing or debt used by the town to finance such capital facilities
and other costs authorized by this section that are included in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (3)   Time limit. Development impact fees collected after July 31, 2014

determine whether changes are necessary. If, after general evaluation, the town
determine that the land use assumptions are still valid, the town shall issue
the report required in this chapter.
      (3)   Required modifications to land use assumptions. If the town
determines that changes to the land use assumptions are necessary in order to
adopt or amend an Infrastructure Improvements Plan, it shall make such changes
as necessary to the land use assumptions prior to or in conjunction with the
review and approval of the Infrastructure Improvements Plan pursuant to this
chapter.
   (H)   Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (1)   Infrastructure Improvements Plan contents. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall be developed by qualified professionals and may be
based upon or incorporated within the town’s Capital Improvements Plan. The

         (a)   Specify the categories of necessary public services for which
the town will impose a development impact fee, which may include any or all of
the following:
            1.   Water;
            2.   Wastewater;
            3.   Road facilities;
            4.   Fire protection;
            5.   Police; and
            6.   Park.
         (b)   Define and provide a map of one or more service areas within
which the town will provide each category of necessary public services for
which development impact fees will be charged. Each service area must be
defined in a manner that demonstrates a substantial nexus between the capital
facilities to be provided in the service area and the development unit to be
served by those capital facilities. For libraries and for parks larger than 30
acres, each service area must be defined in a manner that demonstrates a direct
benefit between the capital facilities and the development unit to be served by
those capital facilities. The town may cover more than one category of capital
facilities in the same service area provided that there is an independent
substantial nexus or direct benefit, as applicable, between each category of
necessary public services and the development unit to be served.
         (c)   Identify and describe the land use assumptions upon which the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based in each service area.
         (d)   Analyze and identify the existing level of service provided by
the town to existing development unit for each category of necessary public
services in each service area.
         (e)   Identify the level of service to be provided by the town for
each category of necessary public services in each service area based on the
relevant land use assumptions and any established town standards or policies
related to required levels of service. If the town provides the same category
of necessary public services in more than one service area, the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall include a comparison of the levels of service to be
provided in each service area.
         (f)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the existing capacity of the capital facilities in each service area,
the utilization of those capital facilities by existing development unit, and
the available excess capacity of those capital facilities to serve new
development unit including any existing or planned commitments or agreements
for the usage of such capacity. The Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall
additionally identify any changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities
that will be needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to
existing development unit, or to meet new safety, efficiency, environmental, or
other regulatory requirements for services provided to existing development
unit; and those portions of capital facilities that will be necessary to serve
any new public school, private school, or town facility for which development
impact fees will not be assessed.
         (g)   Identify any grandfathered facilities and the impact thereof on
the need for necessary public services in each affected service area.
         (h)   Estimate the total number of existing and future development
units within each service area based on the town's land use assumptions and
projected new development unit in each service area.
         (i)   Based on the analysis in divisions (H)(1)(c) through (H)(1)(f)
above, provide a summary table or tables describing the level of service for
each category of necessary public services by relating the required capital
facilities to development unit in each service area, and identifying the
applicable development unit factor associated with each category of
development.
         (j)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing
capital facilities, and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be
required to provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service
area as a result of the new projected development unit in that service area,
for a period not to exceed ten years. Nothing in this division shall prohibit
the town from additionally including in its Infrastructure Improvements Plan
projected utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer
than ten years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded
from the calculation of the plan-based cost per EDU.
         (k)   For each category of necessary public services, estimate the
total cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital
facilities that will be required to serve new development unit, including costs
of land acquisition, improvements, engineering and architectural services,
studies leading to design, design, construction, financing, and administrative
costs, as well as projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not
include costs for ongoing operation and maintenance of capital facilities, nor
for replacement of capital facilities to the extent that such replacement is
necessary to serve existing development unit. If the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan includes changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities
that will be needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to
existing development unit, or to meet new regulatory requirements for services
provided to existing development unit, such costs shall be identified and
distinguished in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
         (l)   Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments, or other
sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities
identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, which shall include
estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad
valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes, and
the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based
on the approved land use assumptions. The Infrastructure Improvements Plan
shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct, and
implement the new or expanded capital facilities.
         (m)   Calculate required offsets as follows.
            1.   From the forecasted revenues in division (H)(1)(l) of this
section, identify those sources of revenue that are attributable to new
development, and will contribute to paying for the capital costs of necessary
public services.
            2.   For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to
division (H)(1)(m)1., calculate the relative contribution of each category of
development to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services in
each service area.
            3.   Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to
division (H)(1)(m)2., for each category of necessary public services, calculate
the total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service
area.
            4.   For each category of necessary public services, convert the
total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service
area into an offset amount per development unit by dividing the total offset
for each category of development by the number of development unit associated
with that category of development.
            5.   Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the
required offset, if the town imposes a construction, contracting, or similar
excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege
tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax
classifications in the town, the entire excess portion of the construction,
contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the
capital costs of necessary public services provided to new development unless
the excess portion is already utilized for such purpose pursuant to this
section.
            6.   In determining the amount of required offset for land included
in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter
4, Article 6, the town shall take into account any capital facilities provided
by the district that are included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
the capital costs paid by the district for such capital facilities, and shall
offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district
proportionally.
         (n)   Calculate the plan-based cost per development unit by:
            1.   Dividing the total projected costs to provide capital
facilities to the new development unit for each category of necessary public
services in each service area as determined pursuant to division (H)(1)(j) into
the number of new development unit projected for that service area over a
period not to exceed ten years, considering the specific development unit
factor(s) associated with such development unit for each category of necessary
public services; and
            2.   Subtracting the required offset per development unit
calculated pursuant to division (H)(1)(m).
      (2)   Multiple plans. An Infrastructure Improvements Plan adopted
pursuant to this division may address one or more of the town's categories of
necessary public services in any or all of the town's service areas. Each
capital facility shall be subject to no more than one Infrastructure
Improvements Plan at any given time.
      (3)   Reserved capacity. The town may reserve capacity in an
Infrastructure Improvements Plan to serve one or more planned future
developments, including capacity reserved through a development agreement
pursuant to division (M) of this section. All reservations of existing capacity
must be disclosed in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan at the time it is
adopted.

charges assessed pursuant to division (K)(2)(e) below, shall be calculated and
collected prior to issuance of permission to commence development;
specifically:
         (a)   Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement
adopted pursuant to this section, development impact fees shall be paid prior
to issuance of a building permit according to the current development impact
fee schedule for the applicable service area(s) as adopted pursuant to this
section, or according to any other development impact fee schedule as
authorized in division (K)(4).
         (b)   If a building permit is not required for the development, but
water or wastewater connections are required, any and all development impact
fees due shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased.
If only a wastewater connection is required, the development impact fees shall
be paid prior to approval of a connection to the sewer system.
         (c)   No building permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of
occupancy shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed
in the previous paragraphs.
         (d)   If the building permit is for a change in the type of building
use, an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a
residential or nonresidential point of demand to the water or wastewater
system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service
units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development
impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type.
         (e)   For issued permits that expire or are voided, development impact
fees and administrative charges shall be as follows:
            1.   If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or
voided permit, and the development impact fees paid for the development have
not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any
development impact fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the
fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed.
            2.   If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being
sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit applicant
shall pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in
effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original
permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit
applicant, the new permit applicant shall pay development impact fees as if it
were the original permittee.
      (3)   Exemptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either
of the following conditions:
         (a)   Development impact fees have been paid for the development and
the permit(s) which triggered the collection of the development impact fees
have not expired or been voided.
         (b)   The approvals that trigger the collection of development impact
fees involve modifications to existing development that do not result in an
increase in the number of service units.
      (4)   Temporary exemption from fee increases. New developments in the
town shall be temporarily exempt from increases in development impact fees that
result from the adoption of new or modified development impact fee schedules,
as follows.
         (a)   Single-family uses. On or after the day that the first building
permit is issued for a single-family residential development, the town shall,
at the permittee's request, provide the permittee with an applicable
development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24
months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which
shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter.
During the effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule,
any building permit issued for the same single-family residential development
shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee schedule.
         (b)   Nonresidential and multi-family uses. On or after the day of
approval of a site plan, or if no site plan is required for the development the
approval of the final subdivision plat, for a nonresidential or multi-family
development, the town shall, at the permitee's request. provide the permittee
with an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a
period of 24 months beginning on the day that final development approval of a
site plan or final subdivision plat is given, and which shall expire at the end
of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter. During the effective
period of the applicable development impact fee schedule, any building permit
issued for the same development shall not be subject to any new or modified
development impact fee schedule.
         (c)   Changes to site plans and subdivision plats. Notwithstanding the
other requirements of this section, if changes are made to a development's
final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service
units after the issuance of a grandfathered development impact fee schedule,
the town may assess any new or modified development impact fees against the
additional service units.
         (d)   Fee reductions provided. If the town reduces the amount of an
applicable development impact fee during the period that a grandfathered
development impact fee schedule is in force, the town shall assess the lower
development impact fee.
   (L)   Credits and credit agreements.
      (1)   Eligibility of capital facility. All development impact fee credits
must meet the following requirements.
         (a)   One of the following is true:
            1.   The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward the
capital facility, that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit
will be issued must be identified in an adopted Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and fee report as a capital facility for which a development impact fee
was assessed: or
            2.   The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town
that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility
should have been included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan in lieu of a
different capital facility that was included in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject
capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the
town shall amend the Infrastructure Improvements Plan to (i) include the
subject replacement facility and (ii) delete the capital facility that will be
replaced.
         (b)   The subject development is located within the service area of
the eligible capital facility.
         (c)   Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided
by a developer if the cost of the infrastructure will be repaid to the
developer by the town through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent
that the developer will be paid or reimbursed by the town or an improvement
district for any contribution, payment, construction, or dedication from any
town funding source, any credits claimed by the developer shall be reduced by
any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the town or improvement district.
      (2)   Calculation of credits. Credit amounts will be based on that
portion of the costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted
Infrastructure Improvements Plan for which a development fee was assessed
pursuant to the fee report. If the gross impact fee for a particular category
of necessary public service is adopted at an amount lower than the net cost per
service unit, the amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to the
difference between the net cost per service unit and the gross impact fee
adopted. A credit shall not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in
providing the eligible capital facility. The amount of the credit shall be
determined by the Town Engineer.
      (3)   Application of credits. Unless otherwise provided in a development
agreement, credits shall be applied to reduce the amount of the development
impact fees otherwise due for the subject development. Credits shall be applied
on a first-come, first-served basis until the amount of the credit has been
exhausted or the subject development has been completed. Credits shall not be
transferable to another development.
      (4)   Effective date of credits. Unless otherwise provided in a
development agreement, credits shall become effective when the amount of the
credit has been determined by the Town Engineer and the improvement, dedication
or financial contribution has been accepted by the town. Prior to credits
becoming effective, development impact fees for the subject development shall
be due and payable in full, but shall be refunded to the fee paver in whole or
part, as applicable, after the credits become effective.
      (5)   Issuance of credits. Credits may be issued and applied toward the
gross impact fees due from a development, subject to the following conditions.
         (a)   Credits issued for an eligible capital facility may only be
applied to the development impact fee due for the applicable category of
necessary public services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another
category of necessary public services.
         (b)   Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to
another permit or parcel, except that credits may be released for reuse on the
same subject development if a building permit for which the credits were issued
has expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a refund under this
section.
      (6)   Life of credits. Unless otherwise provided in a development
agreement, credits must be used within ten years from their effective date.
   (M)   Development agreements. Development agreements containing provisions
regarding development impact fees, development impact fee credits, and/or
disbursement of revenues from development impact fee accounts shall comply with
the following provisions.
      (1)   Development agreement required. A development agreement is required
to authorize any of the following:
         (a)   To issue credits prior to the town's acceptance of an eligible
capital facility, provided that the development agreement specifically states
the form and value of the security (i.e. bond, letter of credit, and the like)
to be provided to the town prior to issuance of any credits. The town shall
determine the acceptable form and value of the security to be provided.
         (b)   To transfer credits to a parcel that is within the same service
area but outside the subject development.
         (c)   To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using
funds from development impact fee accounts. Funds reimbursed to developers from
impact fee accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be
utilized in accordance with applicable law for the use of town funds in
construction or acquisition of capital facilities, including A.R.S. §§ 34-201
et seq.
         (d)   To allocate different credit amounts within a subject
development in a manner other than first-come, first-served.
         (e)   To allow development impact fees for a single-family residential
development to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit,
provided that a development impact fee may not be paid later than the 15 days
after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for that dwelling unit. The
development agreement shall provide for the value of any deferred development
impact fees to be supported by appropriate security, including a surety bond,
letter of credit, or cash bond.
         (f)   To waive development impact fees. If the town agrees to waive
any development impact fees assessed on development in a development agreement,
the town shall reimburse the appropriate development impact fee account for the
amount that was waived.
         (g)   To allow the use of credits to extend beyond ten years of their
effective date.
      (2)   General requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared
and executed in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and any applicable
requirements of the Town Code.
      (3)   No obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the town to enter
into any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit arrangement
permitted by this section.
   (N)   Appeals. A development impact fee determination by town staff may be
appealed in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   Limited scope. An appeal shall be limited to disputes regarding the
appropriate land use category or other matters relating to the determination of
the number of new service units for a specific development, or the amount of a
credit.
      (2)   Form of appeal. An appeal shall be initiated on such written form
as the town may prescribe, setting forth, with particularity, the basis of the
protest, the development impact fees involved and the relief requested. The
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the determination was made, in
writing and prior to paving the development impact fees.
      (3)   Decision. The Town Manager shall approve or deny the protest, in
whole or in part, within 60 days after its submittal to the town. The Town
Manager's determination shall be provided in writing to the property owner and
the Town Council and shall be final unless, within 30 days after the Town
Manager's determination, a majority of the Town Council votes to hold a public
hearing on the appeal. In such case, the Town Council shall hold a public
hearing and shall make a determination within 30 days after the public hearing.
The decision of the Town Council shall be based on the applicable provisions of
this section, and shall be final.
      (4)   Fees during pendency. Building permits may be issued during the
pendency of an appeal if the applicant (a) pays the full impact fee calculated
by the town at the time the appeal is filed or (b) provides the town with
financial assurances in the form acceptable to the Town Manager or authorized
designee equal to the full amount of the impact fee. Upon final disposition of
an appeal, the fee shall be adjusted in accordance with the decision rendered,
and a refund paid if warranted. If the appeal is denied by the Town Council,
and the applicant has provided the town with financial assurances, the
applicant shall deliver the full amount of the impact fee to the town within
ten days of the final decision on the appeal. If the applicant fails to deliver
the full amount of the impact fees when required by this section, the town may
draw upon such financial assurance instrument(s) as necessary to recover the
full amount of the impact fees due from the applicant.
   (O)   Refunds.
      (1)   Generally. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current
owner of property within the town who submits a written request to the town and
demonstrates that one of the following applies.
         (a)   The permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development
impact fee have expired or been voided prior to the commencement of the
development for which the permits were issued and the development impact fees
collected have not been expended, encumbered, or pledged for the repayment of
financing or debt; or
         (b)   The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in
interest paid a development impact fee for the applicable capital facility on
or after August 1, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists:
            1.   The capital facility designed to serve the subject real
property has been constructed, has the capacity to serve the subject real
property and any development for which there is reserved capacity, and the
service which was to be provided by that capital facility has not been provided
to the subject real property from that capital facility or from any other
infrastructure.
            2.   After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility the
town fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time
period identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, as it may be
amended, and the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject
real property from that capital facility or any other infrastructure.
            3.   For a category of necessary public services other than water
or wastewater facilities, any part of a development impact fee is not spent
within ten years of the town's receipt of the development impact fee.
            4.   Any part of a development impact fee for water or wastewater
facilities is not spent within 15 years of the town's receipt of the
development impact fee.
            5.   The development impact fee was calculated and collected for
the construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital
facility serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs
for the capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the
infrastructure improvements plan by a factor of 10% or more. In this event, the
current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request, be entitled to
a refund for the difference between the amounts of the development impact fee
charged for and attributable to the construction cost and the amount the
development impact fee would have been calculated to be if the actual
construction cost had been included in the fee report. The refund contemplated
by this section shall relate only to the costs specific to the construction of
the applicable capital facility and shall not include any related design,
administrative, or other costs not directly incurred for construction of the
capital facility that are included in the development impact fee as permitted
by A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
      (2)   Earned interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include
any interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development impact
fee by the town from the date of collection to the date of refund. All refunds
shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is
paid.
      (3)   Refund to government. If a development impact fee was paid by a
governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity.
   (P)   Oversight.
      (1)   Annual report. Within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year, the
town shall file with the Town Clerk an unaudited annual report accounting for
the collection and use of the fees for each service area and shall post the
report on its website in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05(N) and (O), as
amended.
      (2)   Biennial audit. In addition to the annual report described in
division (1) above, the town shall provide for a biennial, certified audit of
the town's land use assumptions, Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
development impact fees.
         (a)   An audit pursuant to this section shall be conducted by one or
more qualified professionals who are not employees or officials of the town and
who did not prepare the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
         (b)   The audit shall review the collection and expenditures of
development fees for each project in the plan and provide written comments
describing the amount of development impact fees assessed, collected, and spent
on capital facilities.
         (c)   The audit shall describe the level of service in each service
area, and evaluate any inequities in implementing the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan or imposing the development impact fee.
         (d)   The town shall post the findings of the audit on the town's
website and shall conduct a public hearing on the audit within 60 days of the
release of the audit to the public.
         (e)   For purposes of this section a certified audit shall mean any
audit authenticated by one or more of the qualified professionals conducting
the audit.

      (3)   An application for appeal by an aggrieved person shall be based on
a claim that the true intent of the relevant technical code or the rules
legally adopted by the town have been incorrectly interpreted, the provisions
of the code do not fully apply, an equally good or better form of construction
is proposed, or an equivalent method of protection or safety is proposed. The
Board shall provide a means by which aggrieved persons, after having proceeded
through the administrative appeal process, may have a method by which to appeal
said decision or regulations.
      (4)   The administrative appeal is the start of the appeal process to the
town's adopted technical codes. It is a weekly, no fee, informal procedure in
which the applicant and Building Official and/or Fire Code Official meet to
resolve the item under consideration.
      (5)   Appeals to the administrative appeal process or Board of Appeals

suitability, strength, effectiveness, fire-resistance, durability, safety, and
sanitation.
      (2)   The Board on request or on its own motion, may provide reasonable
interpretation of the technical provisions of the adopted technical codes in
special cases when it appears that the provisions of the code are inadequate
and do not cover the point in question. TECHNICAL PROVISIONS shall mean all
provisions except the administrative provisions.

application to appeal is filed in the office of the Town Clerk within 20 days
after the decision, notice, or order was served. Application for appeal shall
be based on a claim that: the true intent of the relevant technical code or the
rules legally adopted by the town have been incorrectly interpreted, the
provisions of the code do not fully apply, an equally good or better form of
construction is proposed, or an equivalent method of protection or safety is
proposed. The Board shall have no authority to waive the requirements of the
technical codes.
      (6)   The Board shall render all decisions and findings in writing to the
appellant with a duplicate copy to the Building Official and Fire Code
