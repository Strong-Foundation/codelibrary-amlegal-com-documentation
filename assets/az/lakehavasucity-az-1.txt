§ 1.12.050 ABATEMENT.
   A.   Notice to abate.
      1.   In addition to or in lieu of filing a civil citation or criminal
complaint, the city may serve a notice to abate any violation of this code.
      2.   The notice to abate shall contain the following information:
         a.   A detailed description of the conditions constituting the
violations along with legal citations of applicable code, statutory, or
regulatory provisions.
         b.   The period of time, not less than 30 calendar days from the
service of the notice to abate, in which the person responsible for the
violation must abate or correct the violation.
         c.   Identification of the property in violation by legal description
and street address, if known, and if unknown, then by book, map, and parcel
number.
         d.   Re-inspection date, if any.
         e.   Name, business address, and business phone number of the Code
Official who issued the notice.
         f.   A warning statement that if the violations are not corrected
within the period stated, the city may abate the nuisance itself or by private
contractor, assess the owner for the cost of such abatement, and record a lien
on the property for the assessment.
      3.   Prior to the date set for compliance on the notice to abate, the
person responsible for the violation may appeal in writing to the Council. The
Council shall, at its next regular meeting no less than 7 calendar days after
receiving the appeal, hear the appeal and issue a decision of the Council,
which shall be final. The Council may either affirm or reverse the notice or
may modify the scope of the work required under the notice to abate. The 30
days given to perform the work shall be stayed during the time from the date
the appeal is received by the City Clerk until written notice of the Council’s
decision is served in the same manner upon the person responsible for the
violation as set forth in §
1.12.050H. The Council may grant an extension of time for compliance at the
time of its disposition of the appeal.
      4.   Nothing in this section shall require the issuance of notice of
violation prior to commencement of other enforcement proceedings, including
civil or criminal proceedings.
   B.   Summary abatement. Whenever any violation of the code causes a
condition constituting an immediate and emergent threat to the public’s health,
safety or welfare or to the environment, the city may summarily and without
prior notice abate the condition. Notice of abatement, including the reason for
it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as
reasonably possible after the abatement. For violations of Title 12: Buildings
and Construction, all notices, if any, required under Title 12: Buildings and
Construction shall be given in accordance with such provision before the city
may summarily abate a violation.
   C.   Court ordered abatement.
      1.   In addition to any other abatement procedure provided in this
chapter, the City Manager or designee, or the City Attorney’s Office, may apply
to the Municipal Court for an order permitting the city to abate any condition
that constitutes a violation of this code.
      2.   After notice to the person responsible for the violation, the judge
or court hearing officer shall conduct a hearing. The hearing shall be informal
and open to the public. Evidence may be taken from any interested party and
considered in determining whether a condition in violation of the public
nuisance ordinance exists and what, if any, abatement action should be
permitted. Any person who fails to appear after notice of the hearing may be
deemed to have waived any right to introduce evidence. The court’s
determination shall be based on the preponderance of evidence.
   D.   Upon finding that abatement is appropriate, the court may order
demolition, board-up, clean-up or any other action the court deems reasonably
necessary to correct the violation.
   E.   Statement of account.
      1.   When the city has undertaken action to abate a violation, the City
Manager or designee shall prepare a verified statement of the actual costs of
abatement, including associated legal, inspection, and other incidental
connected costs. That statement shall further set forth the following:
         a.   The street address and legal description of the property.
         b.   Reference to attachment of the notice to abate and order to abate
and applicable invoices, contracts, or other documentation of the work done.
         c.   The date the work was completed.
         d.   A summary and total of the costs of abatement.
         e.   That the statement of account is an assessment upon the lots and
tracts of land from which the city corrected or abated the violation.
         f.   That the party has 15 calendar days from the date of service to
pay the total cost of abatement.
         g.   In the event payment is not received in 15 calendar days, the
city will place a lien on the property in the amount of the assessment.
         h.   The right and procedures for appeals of statement of account.
      2.   The statement of account shall be served in the same manner as
prescribed in §
1.12.050H.
      3.   The statement of account is subject to the same appeal process as
outlined in §
1.12.050A.3. If no written and timely request for hearing is made under this
section, then the statement of account is final and binding. The city is
authorized to record an assessment in the amount specified in the statement of
account with the Mohave County Recorder’s Office.
      4.   From the date of recording, the assessment shall be a lien on the
property and shall bear interest at the legal rate until paid. The recorded
assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited
therein and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to recording thereof.
      5.   An assessment under this section shall not be a bar to subsequent
assessments hereunder and any number of liens on the same property may be
enforced in a single action.
      6.   The city may bring an action to enforce the lien in the superior
court at any time after the recording of the assessment, but failure to enforce
the lien by such action shall not affect its validity.
   F.   Recording of violation or lien of assessment. The notice to abate and
statement of account and any assessment lien recorded by the city shall run
with the land. The city, at its sole discretion, may record a notice to abate,
order to abate, and a statement of account with the Mohave County Recorder and
thereby cause compliance by an entity thereafter acquiring such property. When
the property is brought into compliance, a satisfaction of notice to abate
shall be recorded with the Mohave County Recorder. When an assessment lien is
paid off, a satisfaction of the lien shall be recorded.
   G.   Appeal of court decision. Any party may appeal the judgment of the
court to the superior court. Appeals from civil proceedings shall be in
accordance with the Superior Court Rule of Appellate Procedure—Civil. Execution
of any judgment shall be stayed pending appeal.
   H.   The notice to abate and the statement of account shall be served per
the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure to the person responsible for the
violation. Service is deemed effective and complete on the date it is received
by the person responsible for the violation.

of the removal by the city if the owner, occupant, or lessee does not comply.
The notice may be recorded in the County Recorder’s Office, and if satisfied,
the city must record a release of the notice.
      2.   Prior to the date set for compliance on the notice, the owner,
occupant, or lessee of the property may appeal in writing to the Council unless
the removal or abatement is ordered by a court. The Council shall, at its next
regular meeting no less than 7 calendar days after receiving the appeal, hear
the appeal and issue a decision of the Council, which shall be final. The
Council may either affirm or reverse the notice or may modify the scope of the
work required pursuant to the notice. The 30 days given to perform the work
shall be stayed during the time from the date the appeal is received by the
City Clerk until written notice of the Council’s decision is provided, as set
forth in §
1.12.055A.1., upon the owner, occupant, or lessee. The Council may grant an
extension of time for compliance at the time of its disposition of the appeal.
      3.   That any person that recklessly places or causes to be placed any
rubbish, trash, filth or debris on any property not owned or under the control
of that person:
         a.   Is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor or a civil violation unless
that person immediately removes or causes to be removed the rubbish, trash,
filth or debris from that property. One hundred percent of any assessed fine or
civil penalty shall be deposited in the general fund of the city. At least 50%
of the fine or civil penalty shall be used by the city for the purposes of
illegal dumping cleanup.
         b.   In addition to any fine or penalty imposed for a violation of
this section, the person is liable for all costs that may be assessed pursuant
to this section for removing, abating or enjoining the rubbish, trash, filth or
debris and for all costs incurred by the owner, lessee, occupant or lienholder
of the property in the removal and disposal of the rubbish, trash, filth or
debris.
         c.   If required to remove any rubbish, trash, filth or debris
pursuant to this section, the person must provide the city a receipt from a
disposal facility or other documentation evidencing lawful disposal of the
rubbish, trash, filth or debris.
   B.   In the event that any person with interest in the property fails to
remove the rubbish, trash, weeds, filth, debris, or dilapidated structures and
abate the condition which constitutes a hazard to public health and safety,
after notice as provided herein has been given, the city may, at the expense of
the owner, occupant, or lessee, remove, abate, enjoin, or cause the removal
thereof.
   C.   The cost of removal, abatement, or injunction of the rubbish, trash,
weeds, filth, debris or dilapidated builds from any property, and associated
legal, inspection, and other incidental connected costs, shall be assessed on
the property and may be recorded in the Mohave County Recorder’s Office.
Service of the assessment shall be in manner prescribed in §
1.12.055A.1. and appeal of the assessment shall be in the manner prescribed in
§
1.12.055A.2.
   D.   Assessments run against the property until paid. A prior assessment for
the purposes provided in this section shall not be a bar to subsequent
assessments, and any number of assessments on the same property may be enforced
in the same action.

   A.   1.   Authority. Under powers granted to Lake Havasu City by A.R.S. § 9-
240 A and B(29), this section is herein established.
      2.   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to establish an
administrative fee schedule whereby the Municipal Court may defray costs
associated with the additional work related to issuing and processing numerous
failure to appear warrants and the suspension of driving privileges. It further
establishes a Court enhancement fee to provide funds supplemental to budgetary
funds for advancing Court operations in the areas of technology, Court
security, and programs designed to improve Court efficiency. This section also
provides for the recovery of the actual per diem costs of incarceration as the
result of a person being convicted and sentenced to a term of incarceration in
the Mohave County Jail by the City Magistrate.
      3.   Jurisdiction. This section shall apply to all cases arising within
the Jurisdiction of the Municipal Court.
   B.   1.   Warrant fee. The Municipal Court may collect a warrant fee of $150
for each warrant the court is required to issue as the result of a failure to
appear, which includes any failure to appear at scheduled, or otherwise
required, court appearance. This fee applies to all forms and types of warrants
and shall be added to the amount set forth in the arrest warrant.
      2.   Default fee. The Municipal Court may collect a default fee of $50
for civil traffic violations, water violations, and local ordinance violations
as a result of a failure to pay civil sanction or default judgment in a civil
matter.
      3.   Deposit into General Fund. All warrant and default fees collected
under this section shall be received by the Municipal Court in a manner
consistent with the Arizona Supreme Court Accounting Standards and deposited
with the Treasurer in a timely manner, consistent with Municipal Court deposit
policies and procedures, into the City General Fund.
   C.   1.   Court enhancement fee. The Municipal Court may collect a Court
enhancement fee of $20 which shall be assessed in addition to any fine,
sanction, or penalty imposed by the Court. The Court enhancement fee shall be
collected after the statutory priorities of restitution and time payment fees
if applicable. The Court enhancement fee shall be received by the Court in a
manner consistent with the Arizona Supreme Court Accounting Standards and
deposited with the Treasurer on a monthly basis for deposit into the Court
Enhancement Fund.
      2.   Court Enhancement Fund. The Court Enhancement Fund shall be
established as a separate fund so designated by the City Treasurer for the
purpose of receiving the Court enhancement fee. Interest earned on fund monies
invested with the Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP) shall be deposited
into the fund. The Court Enhancement Fund shall be used to the limit of
available fund balance, as appropriated in the annual Court budget. The City
Magistrate may use Court enhancement funds in conjunction with any other Courts
in any common projects, programs, or uses which may benefit the Municipal
Court’s operations.
   D.   1.   Jail costs recovery fee. The Municipal Court may require any
person who is convicted of a misdemeanor criminal offense and sentenced to a
term of incarceration in the Mohave County jail, or any other facility
authorized by law, to reimburse Lake Havasu City for all or any part of the
actual expenses the city has or will incur by reason of the incarceration. The
maximum amount ordered for reimbursement under this section shall not exceed
the number of days the misdemeanant is actually incarcerated, multiplied by the
actual costs per day, including any part of a 24-hour period which shall be
considered 1 day.
      2.   Factors to be considered. The City Magistrate may determine the
amount of incarceration costs to be paid based on the following factors: The
per diem per person cost of incarceration incurred by the City. The person’s
ability to pay all or part of the incarceration costs.
   E.   Collection fees. Any defendant who defaults in his or her obligation
for the payment of monies owed or due the Municipal Court, including but not
limited to, restitution, fines, surcharges, assessments, penalties, bond, costs
and fees is liable for all costs of collection including attorney fees and
costs and/or any fees and charges assessed by a collection agency that is
licensed pursuant to A.R.S. §§ 32-1001 et seq., and that is engaged legally by
contract or otherwise to act on behalf of the Municipal Court for the purpose
of collecting the aforementioned obligations. All such costs and fees,
including legal fees and Court costs related to collection, assessed by the
collection agency may be added to the sum or sums due from and chargeable to
the defendant.
   F.   Waive, suspend, and deferring fees. The City Magistrate or Associate
City Magistrate or Hearing Officer may waive, suspend, or defer payment of all
or part of any fee upon a determination of economic hardship on the part of the
defendant, or in the interests of justice.
   G.   Community service conversion. The City Magistrate may convert all or
part of any fee to community service time at a rate consistent with the Court’s
community service program. Upon approval of the Judge, a Court collections
officer may convert all or part of any fee to community service time.
   H.   Prosecution assessment recovery fee. Any person who is convicted of a
misdemeanor criminal offense following a trial or a plea agreement, or whose
criminal case in the Municipal Court is resolved through an agreement to defer
prosecution or entry of a guilty plea, shall pay to the Municipal Court a
prosecution assistance recovery fee in the sum of $100 for each conviction
following trial or plea agreement, or any agreement to defer prosecution or
entry of a guilty plea. A prosecution assessment fee in an amount higher than
$100 may be imposed by mutual agreement of the prosecutor and the defendant
convicted of a criminal offense as part of a plea agreement or agreement to
defer prosecution or entry of a guilty plea. The prosecution assessment
recovery fee shall be collected by the Municipal Court for deposit into the
city general fund.
   I.   Severability. If any fee imposed herein is determined by a Court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable in whole or in part, the other fees
imposed herein shall not be affected and shall remain fully enforceable.

   C.   All proposals submitted to the City Manager must be in writing and in a
form which can be incorporated into a memorandum of understanding.
   D.   Upon receiving a proposal from a designated employee organization and/

   J.   The Mayor and Council may accept, reject or modify those areas of
agreement within the proposed memorandum of understanding or may take whatever
action they feel appropriate with regard to any areas in dispute. Final action
by the Mayor and Council shall constitute the memorandum of understanding for a
budget year.
   K.   If there is a claim of breach of a memorandum of understanding and the
employee organization's existing memorandum of understanding does not provide a
process for resolution of the breach, the breach process in division L shall
apply. If the matter is submitted for resolution to the Mayor and City Council
either through the breach process established in division L or a breach process
established in a memorandum of understanding, the decision of the Mayor and
City Council shall be final and binding upon the parties and employees.
   L.   In the event that there is a claim of breach of a memorandum of
understanding that the employee organization and the city have been unable to
informally resolve, the following process shall be followed:

claims that the memorandum of understanding has been breached, the parties
shall:

parties.

regardless of the number of rental units located on that platted parcel. If one
structure is located on multiple parcels in a manner such that ownership of an
individual parcel cannot be sold or transferred without requiring alteration to

inability resulted from inaccurate or inadequate books, records, or
documentation maintained by the taxpayer.

(b)   Any person who claims and receives an exemption, deduction, exclusion, or
credit to which he is not entitled under this Chapter, shall be subject to,
liable for, and pay the tax on the transaction as if the vendor subject to the
tax had passed the burden of the payment of the tax to the person wrongfully
claiming the exemption. A person who wrongfully claimed such exemption shall be
treated as if he is delinquent in the payment of the tax and shall be subject
to interest and penalties upon such delinquency. However, if the tax is
collected from the vendor on such transaction it shall not again be collected

(Ord. 15-1132, passed 5-26-2015; Ord. 21-1252, passed 4-13-2021)
Sec. 3.03-372. Proof of exemption: sale for resale; sale, rental, lease, or
license of rental equipment.
A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for
rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to persuade
a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being acquired for
resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course of business. The
fact that the acquiring person possesses a Privilege License number, and makes
a verbal claim of “sale for resale or lease” or “lease for re-lease” does not
meet this burden and is insufficient to justify an exemption. The “reasonable
evidence” must be evidence which exists objectively, and not merely in the mind
of the vendor, that the property being acquired is normally sold, rented,
leased, or licensed by the acquiring person in the ordinary course of business.
Failure to obtain such reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will
be a basis for disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such
transactions.
(Ord. 15-1132, passed 5-26-2015; Ord. 21-1252, passed 4-13-2021)
Sec. 3.03-380. Inadequate or unsuitable records.
In the event the records provided by the taxpayer are considered by the Tax
Collector to be inadequate or unsuitable to determine the amount of the tax for
which such taxpayer is liable under the provisions of this Chapter, it is the
responsibility of the taxpayer either:
   (a)   To provide such other records required by this Chapter or Regulation;
or
   (b)   To correct or to reconstruct his records, to the satisfaction of the
Tax Collector.

results from extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of provisions of this
Chapter it may enter into closing agreements with those taxpayers under the

   (1)   Extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws occurs if
the Tax Collector determines that more than sixty percent (60%) of the persons
in the affected class have failed to properly account for their taxes owing to
the same misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws.
   (2)   The Tax Collector shall publicly declare the nature of the possible
misapplication and the proposed definition of the class of affected taxpayers

class of affected taxpayers has failed to comply with their tax obligations
because of extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws it
shall issue a tax ruling announcing that finding and publish the ruling in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City and through the next two model
city tax code updates.
   (4)   A closing agreement under this Section may abate some or all of the

tax obligations for these tax periods shall be offered the opportunity to enter
into an equivalent closing agreement providing for a pro rata credit or refund
of their taxes previously paid.
   (6)   The closing agreement shall require the taxpayers to properly account
for and pay such taxes in the future. If a taxpayer fails to adhere to such a
requirement, the closing agreement is voidable by the Tax Collector and he may

a proposed assessment within six months after the date that he declares that
closing agreement void or within the period prescribed by Section

Audits)
(a)   Once the Tax Collector completes an examination authorized by Section
3.05-555 and a written notice of the determination of a deficiency has been
issued to the taxpayer pursuant to Section
3.05-545(a) or
3.05-555(f), the taxpayer's liability for the time period subjected to the
examination is fixed and determined, and no additional audit or examination may
be conducted by the Tax Collector with respect to such time period except under
the following circumstances.
   (1)   If a taxpayer files a claim for refund under Section

presented in the refund claim.
   (2)   If the taxpayer failed to disclose material information during the
initial examination, falsified books or records, or otherwise engaged in
conduct which prevented the Tax Collector from conducting an accurate
examination. The applicability of this subsection, and the Tax Collector's
right to proceed thereunder, may be raised and contested by the taxpayer in a
subsequent administrative review brought pursuant to Section
3.05-570.
(b)   An audit or examination conducted by any other taxing jurisdiction will
not preclude the Tax Collector from conducting an audit or examination for the
same time period.
(c)   If the Tax Collector issues a notice of deficiency pursuant to either
Section
3.05-545(a) or Section
3.05-555(f), the Tax Collector may not increase the proposed deficiency except

Court issued a decision, the applicability of which causes the deficiency
initially proposed to increase.
Sec. 3.05-560. Erroneous payment of tax; credits and refunds; limitations.
(a)   Except as provided in Section
3.05-565, the period within which a claim, meeting the requirements of
subsection (c) of this Section, for credit may be filed, or refund allowed or
made if no claim is filed, shall be as provided in A.R.S. Sections 42-1106 and
42-1118. For purposes of this Section, "claimant" means a taxpayer that has
paid a tax imposed under this article and has submitted a credit or refund
claim under this Section. Except where the taxpayer has granted a customer a
power of attorney to pursue a credit or refund claim on the taxpayer's behalf,
claimant does not include any customer of such taxpayer, whether or not the
claimant collected the tax from customers by separately stated itemization.
(b)   (Reserved)
(c)   A credit or refund claim submitted by a claimant for credit or refund of
any taxes, penalties, or interest paid must be in writing and:

of A.R.S. Section 42-1119.
(h)   Claimants shall be subject to the State taxpayer bill of rights (A.R.S.
Section 42-2051 et. seq.), except that reasonable fees and other costs may be
awarded and are not subject to the monetary limitations of A.R.S. Section 42-
2064 if the Tax Collector's position was not substantially justified or was
brought for the purpose of harassing the claimant, frustrating the credit or
refund process or delaying the credit or refund. For the purposes of this
Section, "reasonable fees and other costs" means fees and other costs that are
based on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the furnished
services, not to exceed the amounts actually paid for expert witnesses, the
cost of any study, analysis, report, test, project or computer program that is
found to be necessary to prepare the claimant's case and necessary fees for
attorneys or other representatives.

by the wrong taxpayer, any taxes erroneously paid shall be transferred by the
City to the privilege tax account of the person who actually owes and should
have paid such taxes, provided that the City receives an assignment and waiver
signed by both the person who actually paid the tax and the person who should
have paid the tax.
(b)   An assignment and waiver provided under this Section, must:
   (1)   Identify the name and City privilege license number of the person who
erroneously paid the tax and the person who should have paid the tax.

such person may have to a refund of the taxes erroneously paid.
   (3)   Authorize the City Treasurer to transfer the erroneously paid tax to
the privilege tax account of the person who should have paid the tax.
(c)   When it is determined that taxes have been reported and paid to the wrong
Arizona city or town, such taxes shall be remitted to the correct city or town,
provided that the city or town to whom the taxes were erroneously paid receives
an assignment and waiver signed by both the person who actually paid the tax
and the person who should have paid the tax. Where the person who actually paid
the tax and the person who should have paid the tax are one and the same, no
assignment and waiver need be provided. The City shall neither pay nor charge
any interest or penalty on any overpayment or underpayment except such interest
and penalty actually paid by the taxpayer relating to such tax.
(d)   This Section in no way limits or restricts the applicability of any
remedies which may otherwise be available under A.R.S. Section 42-6003. The
limitations and procedures set forth in A.R.S. Section 42-6003 shall apply to
all payments under this Section.

Sec. 3.05-570. Administrative review; petition for hearing or for
redetermination; finality of order. (Local Audits)
For the purposes of this section, "Municipal Tax Hearing Office" means the
administrative offices of the Municipal Tax Hearing Officer.
(a)   Informal Conference. A taxpayer shall have the right to discuss any
proposed assessment with the auditor prior to the issuance of any assessment,
but any such informal conference is not required for the taxpayer to file a
petition for administrative review.
(b)   Administrative Review.
   (1)   Filing a Petition. Other than in the case of a jeopardy assessment, a
taxpayer may contest the applicability or amount of tax, penalty, or interest
imposed upon or paid by him pursuant to this Chapter by filing a petition for a
hearing or for redetermination with the Tax Collector as set forth below:
      (A)   Within forty-five (45) days of receipt by the taxpayer of notice of
a determination by the Tax Collector that a tax, penalty, or interest amount is
due, or that a request for refund or credit has been denied; or
      (B)   By voluntary payment of any contested amount when accompanied by a
timely filed return and a petition requesting a refund of the protested portion
of said payment; or
      (C)   By petition accompanying a timely filed return contesting an amount
reported but not paid; or
      (D)   By petition requesting review of denial of waiver of penalty as
provided in subsection 3.05-540(g).
   (2)   Extension to file a petition. In all cases, the taxpayer may request
an extension from the Tax Collector. Such request must be in writing, state the
reasons for the requested delay, and must be filed with the Tax Collector
within the period allowed above for originally filing a petition. The Tax
Collector shall allow a forty-five (45) day extension to file a petition, when
such written request has been properly and timely made by the taxpayer. The Tax
Collector may grant an additional extension and may determine the corresponding
time of any such extension at his sole discretion.
   (3)   Requirements for petition.
      (A)   The petition shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons
why any correction, abatement, or refund should be granted, and the amount of
reduction or refund requested. The petition may be amended at any time prior to
the time the taxpayer rests his case at the hearing or such time as the Hearing
Officer allows for submitting of amendments in cases of redeterminations
without hearings. The Hearing Officer may require that amendments be in
writing, and in that case, he shall provide a reasonable period of time to file
the amendment. The Hearing Officer shall provide a reasonable period of time
for the Tax Collector to review and respond to the petition and to any written
amendments.
      (B)   The taxpayer, as part of the petition, may request a hearing which
shall be granted by the Hearing Officer. If no request for hearing is made the
petition shall be considered to be submitted for decision by the Hearing
Officer on the matters contained in the petition and in any reply made by the
Tax Collector.
      (C)   The provisions of this Section are exclusive, and no petition
seeking any correction, abatement, or refund shall be considered unless the
petition is timely and properly filed under the Section.
   (4)   Transmittal to Hearing Officer. The city/town shall designate a
Hearing Officer, who may be other than an employee of the City. The Tax
Collector, if designated to receive petitions, shall forward any petition to
the Municipal Tax Hearing Office within twenty (20) days after receipt,
accompanied by documentation as to timeliness. In cases where the Hearing
Officer determines that the petition is not timely or not in proper form, he
shall notify both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector; and in cases of petitions
not in proper form only, the Hearing Officer shall provide the taxpayer with an
extension up to forty-five (45) days to correct the petition.
   (5)   Hearings shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer and shall be
continuous until the Hearing Officer closes the record. The taxpayer may be
heard in person or by his authorized representative at such hearing. Hearings
shall be conducted informally as to the order of proceeding and presentation of
evidence. The Hearing Officer shall admit evidence over hearsay objections
where the offered evidence has substantial probative value and reliability.
Further, copies of records and documents prepared in the ordinary course of
business may be admitted, without objection as to foundation, but subject to
argument as to weight, admissibility, and authenticity. Summary accounting
records may be admitted subject to satisfactory proof of the reliability of the
summaries. In all cases, the decision of the Hearing Officer shall be made
solely upon substantial and reliable evidence. All expenses incurred in the
hearing shall be paid by the party incurring the same.
   (6)   Redeterminations upon a "petition for redetermination" shall follow
the same conditions, except that no oral hearing shall be held.
   (7)   Hearing Ruling. In either case, the Hearing Officer shall issue his
ruling not later than forty-five (45) days after the close of the record by the
Hearing Officer.
   (8)   Notice of Refund or Adjusted Assessment. Within sixty (60) days of the
issuance of the Hearing Officer's decision, the Tax Collector shall issue to
the taxpayer either a notice of refund or an adjusted assessment recalculated
to conform to the Hearing Officer's decision.
(c)   Stipulations that future tax is also protested. A taxpayer may enter into
a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature are
also at issue in any protest or appeal. However, unless such stipulation is
made, it is presumed that the protest or appeal deals solely and exclusively
with the tax specifically protested and no other. When a taxpayer enters into
such a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature
will be included in any redetermination, hearing, or court case, it is the
burden of that taxpayer to identify, segregate, and keep record of such income
or protested taxable amount in his books and records in the same manner as the
taxpayer is required to segregate exempt income.
(d)   When an assessment is final.
   (1)   If a request for administrative review and petition for hearing or
redetermination of an assessment made by the Tax Collector is not filed within
the period required by subsection (b) above, such person shall be deemed to
have waived and abandoned the right to question the amount determined to be due
and any tax, interest, or penalty determined to be due shall be final as
provided in subsections
3.05-545(a) and
3.05-555(f).
   (2)   The decision made by the Hearing Officer upon administrative review by
hearing or redetermination shall become final thirty (30) days after the
taxpayer receives the notice of refund or adjusted assessment required by
subsection (b)(8) above, unless the taxpayer appeals the order or decision in
the manner provided in Section
3.05-575.
(e)   The provisions of the State Taxpayer Bill of Rights (A.R.S. Section 42-
2051 et. seq.) shall not apply.

Sec. 3.05-571. Jeopardy assessments. (State Administration and Audits)
(a)   If the Tax Collector believes that collection of any amounts imposed by
this Chapter will be jeopardized by delay, he shall issue notice to the
taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1111.
(b)   In cases where such jeopardy notice has been issued, the taxpayer must
meet the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1111, concerning appeals of jeopardy
assessments, before any request for administrative review shall be honored. Any
bond or collateral that may be required shall meet the provisions of A.R.S.
Section 42-1102.
(c)   (Reserved)
(d)   (Reserved)
(e)   (Reserved)
Sec. 3.05-571. Jeopardy assessments. (Local Audits)
(a)   If the Tax Collector believes that the collection of any assessment or
deficiency of any amounts imposed by this Chapter will be jeopardized by delay,
he shall deliver to the taxpayer a notice of such finding and demand immediate
payment of the tax or deficiency declared to be in jeopardy, including
interest, penalties, and additions.
(b)   Jeopardy assessments are immediately due and payable, and the Tax
Collector may immediately begin proceedings for collection. The taxpayer,
however, may stay collection by filing, within ten (10) days after receipt of
notice of jeopardy assessment, or within such additional time as the Tax
Collector may allow, by bond or collateral in favor of the City in the amount
Tax Collector declared to be in jeopardy in his notice.
(c)   "Bond or Collateral", as required by this Section,
   (1)   Shall mean either:
      (A)   A bond issued in favor of the City by a surety company authorized
to transact business in this State and approved by the Director of Insurance as
to solvency and responsibility, or
      (B)   Collateral composed of securities or cash which are deposited with,
and kept in the custody of, the Tax Collector.
   (2)   Shall be of such form that it may, at any time without notice, be
applied to any tax, penalties, or interest due and payable for the purposes of
this Chapter. Securities held as collateral by the Tax Collector must be of a
nature that they may be sold at public or private sale without notice to the
taxpayer.
(d)   If bond or collateral is not filed within the period prescribed by
subsection (b) above, the tax collector may treat the assessment as final for
purposes of any collection proceedings. The taxpayer nevertheless shall be
afforded the appeal rights provided in Sections
3.05-570 and
3.05-575. The filing of a petition by the taxpayer under Section
3.05-570, however, shall not stay the tax collector's rights to pursue any
collection proceedings.
(e)   If the taxpayer timely files sufficient bond or collateral, the jeopardy
requirements are deemed satisfied, and the taxpayer may avail himself of the
provisions of Section
3.05-570, including requests for additional time to file a petition.
Sec. 3.05-572. (Reserved) (State Administration and Audits)
Sec. 3.05-572. Expedited review of jeopardy assessments. (Local Audits)
(a)   Within thirty (30) days after the day on which the Tax Collector
furnishes the written notice required by Section
3.05-571(a), the taxpayer, pursuant to Section
3.05-570, may request the Tax Collector to review the action taken. Within
fifteen (15) days after the request for review, the Tax Collector shall
determine whether both the jeopardy determination and the amount assessed are
reasonable.
(b)   Within thirty (30) days after the Tax Collector notifies the taxpayer of
the determination he reached pursuant to subsection (a) above, the taxpayer may
bring a civil action in the appropriate court. If the taxpayer so requests, the
City shall stipulate to an accelerated and expedited resolution of the civil
action. If the court determines that either the jeopardy determination or the
amount assessed is unreasonable, the court may order the Tax Collector to abate
the assessment, to redetermine any part of the amount assessed or to take such
other action as the court finds to be appropriate. A determination made by the
court under this subsection is final except as provided in Arizona Revised
Statutes Section 12-170.
Sec. 3.05-575. Judicial review. (State Administration and Audits)

(c)   (Reserved)
(d)   (Reserved)
(e)   The City has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in
any court proceeding regarding any factual issue relevant to ascertaining the
tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any requirement
of this Chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item of gross
income, exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit. This subsection applies to
a factual issue if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that:
   (1)   The taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute regarding the issue.
   (2)   The taxpayer has fully cooperated with the tax collector regarding the
issue, including providing within a reasonable period of time, access to and
inspection of all witnesses, information and documents within the taxpayer's
control, as reasonably requested by the tax collector.
   (3)   The taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by the City.
(f)   The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of refund
due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the decision
of the Hearing Officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the City or the
Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or estoppel to
the institution of an action or counterclaim by the City to recover any amounts
claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original assessment.
(g)   After the initiation of any action in the appropriate court by either
party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be allowed
pursuant to the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure.
Sec. 3.05-575. Judicial review. (Local Audits)
(a)   A taxpayer may seek judicial review of all or any part of a Hearing
Officer's decision by initiating an action against the City in the appropriate
Court of this County. A taxpayer is not required to pay any tax, penalty, or
interest upheld by the hearing officer before seeking such judicial review.
(b)   The Tax Collector may seek judicial review of all or any part of a
Hearing Officer's decision by initiating an action in the appropriate Court of
this County.
(c)   An action for judicial review can not be commenced by either the taxpayer
or the Tax Collector more than thirty (30) days after receipt by the taxpayer
of notice of any refund or assessment recalculated or reduced to conform to the
Hearing Officer's decision, unless the time to commence such an action is
extended in writing signed by both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector. Failure
to bring the action within thirty (30) days or such other time as is agreed
upon in writing shall constitute a waiver of any right to judicial review,
except as provided in subsection (g) below.
(d)   The court shall hear and determine the appeal as a trial de novo;
however, the Tax Collector cannot raise in the court any grounds or basis for
the assessment not asserted before the Hearing Officer. Nothing in this
subsection, however, shall preclude the Tax Collector from responding to any
arguments which are raised by the taxpayer in the appeal.
(e)   The City has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in
any court proceeding regarding any factual issue relevant to ascertaining the
tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any requirement
of this Chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item of gross
income, exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit. This subsection applies to
a factual issue if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that:
   (1)   The taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute regarding the issue.
   (2)   The taxpayer has fully cooperated with the tax collector regarding the
issue, including providing within a reasonable period of time, access to and
inspection of all witnesses, information and documents within the taxpayer's
control, as reasonably requested by the tax collector.
   (3)   The taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by the City.
(f)   The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of refund
due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the decision
of the Hearing Officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the City or the
Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or estoppel to
the institution of an action or counterclaim by the City to recover any amounts
claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original assessment.
(g)   After the initiation of any action in the appropriate court by either
party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be allowed
pursuant to the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure.

Sec. 3.05-578. Reimbursement of fees and other costs; definitions. (Local
Audits)
(a)   A taxpayer who is a prevailing party may be reimbursed for reasonable
fees and other costs related to any administrative proceeding brought by the
taxpayer pursuant to Section
3.05-570(b). For purposes of this Section, a taxpayer is considered to be the
prevailing party only if both of the following are true:
   (1)   The Tax Collector's position was not substantially justified.
   (2)   The taxpayer prevails as to the most significant issue or set of
issues.
(b)   Reimbursement under this Section may be denied if any of the following
circumstances apply:
   (1)   During the course of the proceeding the taxpayer unduly and
unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter.
   (2)   The reason that the taxpayer prevailed is due to an intervening change
in the applicable law.
(c)   The taxpayer shall present an itemization of the reasonable fees and
other costs to the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer within thirty (30) days
after receipt by the taxpayer of a notice of refund or recalculated assessment
issued by the Tax Collector pursuant to Section
3.05-570(b)(8). The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer shall determine the
validity of the fees and other costs within thirty (30) days after receiving
the itemization. The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision is
considered a final decision. Either the taxpayer or the Tax Collector may seek
judicial review of the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision. An
action for judicial review, however, shall not be commenced more than thirty
(30) days after receipt of the resolution officer's decision.
(d)   In the event judicial review is not sought pursuant to subsection (c)
above, the City shall pay the fees and other costs awarded as provided in this
Section within thirty days after demand by a person who has received an award
pursuant to this Section.
(e)   Reimbursement to a taxpayer under this Section shall not exceed twenty
thousand dollars or actual monies spent, whichever is less. The reimbursable
attorney or representative fees shall not exceed one hundred dollars per hour
or actual monies spent, whichever is less, unless the Taxpayer Problem
Resolution Officer determines that an increase in the cost of living or a
special factor such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or
representatives for the proceeding involved justifies a higher fee.
(f)   For purposes of this Section "reasonable fees and other costs" means fees
and other costs that are based on prevailing market rates for the kind and
quality of the furnished services, but not exceeding the amounts actually spent
for expert witnesses, the cost of any study, analysis, report, test or project
that is found to be necessary to prepare the party's case and necessary fees

Sec. 3.05-590. Civil actions. (State Administration and Audits)
(a)   Liens.
   (1)   Any tax, penalty, or interest imposed under this Chapter which has
become final, as provided in this Chapter, shall become a lien when the City
perfects a notice and claim of lien setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the
amount of the tax, penalty, and interest, the period or periods for which the
same is due, and the date of accrual thereof, the amount of the recording costs
by the county recorder in any county in which the taxpayer owns real property
and the documentation and lien processing fees imposed by the City council and
further, stating that the City claims a lien therefor.

notice and claim of lien is recorded or filed, the taxes, penalties, interest
and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above in the amounts
specified therein shall be a lien on all real property of the taxpayer located
in such county where recorded, and all tangible personal property of the
taxpayer within the State, superior to all other liens and assessments recorded

(a)   Liens.
   (1)   Any tax, penalty, or interest imposed under this Chapter which has

taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs and lien processing fees referred
to above and lien release fees imposed by the county recorder in any county in
which the lien was recorded, thereby, be released by the Tax Collector in the

property, for partial payment of moneys due the City.
(b)   Actions to recover tax. An action may be brought by the City Attorney or
other legal advisor to the City designated by the City Council, at the request
of the Tax Collector, in the name of the City, to recover the amount of any
taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs, lien processing fees and lien
release fees due under this Chapter; provided that:
   (1)   No action or proceeding may be taken or commenced to collect any taxes
levied by this Chapter until the amount thereof has been established by
assessment, correction, or reassessment; and
   (2)   Such collection effort is made or the proceedings begun:
      (A)   Within six (6) years after the assessment of the tax; or
      (B)   Prior to the expiration of any period of collection agreed upon in
writing by the Tax Collector and the taxpayer before the expiration of such six
(6) year period, or any extensions thereof; or
      (C)   At any time for the collection of tax arising by reason of a tax
lien perfected, recorded, or possessed by the City under this Section.
Sec. 3.05-595. Collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or cessation
of business.
(a)    In addition to any remedy provided elsewhere in this City Code that may
apply, the Tax Collector may apply the provisions of subsections (b) through
(d) below concerning the collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or
cessation of business.
(b)    The taxes imposed by this Chapter are a lien on the property of any
person subject to this Chapter who sells his business or stock of goods, or
quits his business, if the person fails to make a final return and payment of
the tax within fifteen (15) days after selling or quitting his business.
(c)    Any person who purchases, or who acquires by foreclosure, by sale under
trust deed or warranty deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by any other method,
improved real property or a portion of improved real property for which the
Privilege Tax imposed by this Chapter has not been paid shall be responsible
for payment of such tax as a speculative builder or owner builder, as provided
in Sections
3.04-416 and
3.04-417.
   (1)   any person who is a creditor or an affiliate of creditor, who acquires
improved real property directly or indirectly from the creditor's debtor by any
means set forth in this subsection, shall pay the tax based on the amount
received by the creditor or its affiliate in a subsequent sale of such improved
real property to a party unrelated to the creditor, regardless of when such
subsequent sale takes place. Such tax shall be due in the month following the
month in which the sale of the improved real property by the creditor or its
affiliate occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the real property meets the
definition of partially improved residential real property in Section
3.04-416(a)(4) and all of the requirements of Section
3.04-416(b)(4) are met by the parties to the subsequent sale transaction, then
the tax shall not apply to the subsequent sale.
   (2)   In the event a creditor or its affiliate uses the acquired improved
real property for any business purpose, other than operating the property in
the manner in which it was operated, or was intended to be operated, before the
acquisition or in any other manner unrelated to selling the property, the tax
shall be due. The gross income upon which the tax shall be determined pursuant
to Sections
3.04-416 and
3.04-417 shall be the fair market value of the improved real property as of the
date of acquisition. The tax shall be due in the month following the month in
which such first business use occurs. When applicable, the credit bid shall be
deemed to be the fair market value of the property as of the date of
acquisition.
   (3)   Once the subsequent sale by the creditor or its affiliate has occurred
and the creditor or its affiliate has paid the tax due from it pursuant to this
subsection, neither the creditor nor its affiliate, nor any future owner, shall
be liable for any outstanding tax, penalties or interest that may continue to
be due from the debtor based on the transfer from the debtor to the creditor or
its affiliate.
    (4)   If the tax liability imposed by either Section
3.04-416 or Section
3.04-417 on the transfer of the improved real property to the creditor or its
affiliate, or any part thereof, is paid to the tax collector by the debtor
subsequent to payment of the tax by the creditor or its affiliate, the amount
so paid may constitute a credit, as equitably determined by the tax collector
in good faith, against the tax imposed on the creditor or its affiliate by
either paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this subsection.
   (5)   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, if a
creditor or its affiliate is subject to tax as described in paragraph 1 or
paragraph 2 of this subsection and such creditor or affiliate has not
previously been required to be licensed, such creditor or affiliate shall
become licensed no later than the date on which the tax is due.
(d)   A person's successors or assignees shall withhold from the purchase money
an amount sufficient to cover the taxes required to be paid, and interest or
penalties due and payable, until the former owner produces a receipt from the
Tax Collector showing that all City tax has been paid or a certificate stating
that no amount is due as then shown by the records of the Tax Collector. The
Tax Collector shall respond to a request from the seller for a certificate
within fifteen (15) days by either providing the certificate or a written
notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued.
   (1)    If a subsequent audit shows a deficiency arising before the sale of
the business, the deficiency is an obligation of the seller and does not
constitute a liability against a buyer who has received a certificate from the
Tax Collector.
   (2)   If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to obtain a
certificate as provided by this Section, he is personally liable for payment of
the amount of taxes required to be paid by the former owner on account of the
business so purchased, with interest and penalties accrued by the former owner
or assignees.

the agreement except as otherwise provided in this Section.

(rr)   Machinery, equipment, materials and other tangible personal property
used directly and predominantly to construct a qualified environmental
technology manufacturing, producing or processing facility as described in
A.R.S. Section 41-1514.02. This subsection applies for ten (10), full
consecutive calendar or fiscal years after the start of initial construction.

Reg. 3.07-100.1. Brokers
(a)   For the purposes of proper administration of this Chapter and to prevent
evasion of taxes imposed, brokers shall be wherever necessary treated as
taxpayers for all purposes, and shall file a return and remit the tax imposed
on the activity on behalf of the principal. No deduction shall be allowed for
any commissions or fees retained by such broker, except as provided in Section
3.04-405, relating to advertising commissions.
(b)   Brokers for vendors. A broker acting for a seller, lessor, or other
similar person deriving gross income in a category upon which this Chapter
imposes a tax shall be liable for such tax, even if his principal would not be
subject to the tax if he conducted such activity in his own behalf, by reason
of the activity being deemed a "casual" one. For example:
   (1)   An auctioneer or other sales agent of tangible personal property is
subject to the tax imposed upon retail sales, even if such sales would be
deemed "casual" if his principal had sold such items himself.
   (2)   A property manager is subject to the tax imposed upon rental, leasing,
or licensing of real property, even if such rental, leasing, or licensing would
be deemed "casual" if his principal managed such real property himself.
(c)   Brokers for vendees. A broker acting solely for a buyer, lessee, tenant,
or other similar person who is a party to a transaction which may be subject to
the tax, shall be liable for such tax and for filing a return in connection
with such tax only to the extent his principal is subject to the tax.
(d)   The liability of a broker does not relieve the principal of liability
except upon presentation to the Tax Collector of proof of payment of the tax,
and only to the extent of the correct payment. The broker shall be relieved of
the responsibility to file and pay taxes upon the filing and correct payment of
such taxes by the principal.
(e)   (Reserved)
(f)   Location of Business. Retail sales by brokers acting for another person
shall be deemed to have occurred at the regular business location of the
broker, in a manner similar to that used to determine "out-of-City sales";
provided, however, that an auctioneer is deemed to be engaged in business at
the site of each auction.
Reg. 3.07-100.2. Delivery, installation, or other direct customer services.
(a)   "Delivery Charges" exist only when the total charges to the ultimate
customer or consumer include, as separately charged to the ultimate customer,
charges for delivery to the ultimate consumer, whether the place of delivery is
within or without the City, and when the taxpayer's books and records show the
separate delivery charges.
   (1)   Identification to the customer or consumer that the listed price has
"delivery included" or other similar expression is insufficient to show the
delivery as a separate charge. Only the separately stated charge for the
delivery shall be deemed a "delivery charge".
   (2)   Freight in. Charges for delivery from place of production or the
manufacturer to the vendor either directly or through a chain of wholesalers or
jobbers or other middlemen are deemed "freight-in" and are not considered
delivery.
(b)   "Installation", as used in this definition, relates only to tangible
personal property. Installation to real property is deemed construction
contracting in this Chapter. Examples of installation relating to tangible
personal property are: installing a radio in an automobile; applying sun
screens on the windows of a boat; installing cabinets, carpeting, or "built-in
appliances" to a camper or motorized recreational vehicle.
(c)   Repair of tangible personal property is not included in this definition.
See Regulation
3.07-465.1.
(d)   "Direct Customer Services" means services other than repair rendered
directly to the customer. Services or labor provided by any person prior to the
transfer of tangible personal property to the customer or consumer are not
included in this definition. In the following examples, the requirements of
subsection (e) below are referred to by the words "identify" or
"identification."
   (1)   A retailer sells a customer a $100 "plug-in" appliance, with a $25
delivery and installation charge. If the retailer identifies the $25 delivery
and installation charge, it is a charge for direct customer services.
   (2)   A caterer charges his customer $1,000 for the food and drink served,
$300 for setup and site cleanup, and $500 for bartender and waiters. If all
charges are properly identified, only the $300 for set up and cleanup is a
charge for direct customer services, and the $1,500 for food and service is
restauranting gross income.
   (3)   Persons engaged in engraving on wood, metal, stone, etc. or persons
engaged in retouching photographs or paintings may consider such charges for
labor as direct customer services.
   (4)   All charges by a photographer resulting in the sale of a photograph
(sitting charges, developing, making enlargements, retouching, etc.) for
services that occur prior to transfer of tangible personal property are not
direct customer services.
   (5)   An equipment rental company charging $25 for delivery may consider
such delivery charge as a charge for direct customer service only if such
charge is properly identified.
   (6)   Even if identified, charges for labor incurred in the production of
any manufactured article or of a custom-made article (jewelry, artwork,
tailoring, draperies, etc.) are not included in this definition, as such labor
occurs prior to the transfer of property.
(e)   Recordkeeping requirements.
   (1)   Any person who engages in transactions involving these services must:
      (A)   Separately bill, invoice, or charge the customer for such services
in a manner by which the customer or consumer may readily identify the specific
dollar amount of the service charge; and
      (B)   Maintain business books and records in a manner in which the
separate charge for such services can be clearly identified, to the
satisfaction of the Tax Collector.
   (2)   Rendering a statement to a customer for a transaction involving such
services and the transfer of tangible personal property which only indicates
the total amount of the charges with words such as "services included" or
"charge includes labor and parts" or similar a expression does not satisfy the
requirements of this subsection.
Reg. 3.07-100.3. Retailers.
When in the opinion of the Tax Collector it is necessary for efficient
administration of this Chapter, he may regard any salesman, representative,
peddler, canvasser, or agent of any dealer, distributor, supervisor, or
employer under whom he operates or from whom he obtains tangible personal
property for sale, rental, lease, or license as a retailer for the purposes of
this Chapter, irrespective of whether he is making sales, rentals, leases, or
licenses on his own behalf or on behalf of others. The Tax Collector may also
regard such dealer, distributor, supervisor, or employer as a retailer for the
purposes of this Chapter.
Reg. 3.01-100.4. Out-of-City/Out-of-State Sales: Sales to Native Americans.
Sales to Native Americans or tribal councils by vendors located within the City
shall be deemed sales within the City, unless all of the following conditions
exist:
   (1)   The vendor has properly accounted for such sales, in a manner similar
to the recordkeeping requirements for out-of-City sales; and,
   (2)   All of the following elements of the sale exist:
(a)   Solicitation and placement of the order occurs on the reservation; and
(b)   Delivery is made to the reservation; and
(c)   Payment originates from the reservation.
Reg. 3.07-100.5. Remediation Contracting.
The following activities are considered remediation contracting and are exempt:
   (1)   Excavation, transportation, treatment, and/or disposal of contaminated
soil for purposes of site remediation (rather than characterization);
   (2)   Installation of groundwater extraction and/or injection wells for
purposes of groundwater remediation;
   (3)   Installation of pumps and piping into groundwater extraction wells for
remediation purposes;
   (4)   Installation of vapor extraction wells for the purpose of soil or
groundwater remediation;
   (5)   Construction of remediation systems, such as groundwater treatment
plants, vapor extraction systems, or air injection systems;
   (6)   Connection of remediation systems to utilities;
   (7)   Abandonment of groundwater or vapor extraction wells;
   (8)   Removal/demolition of remediation systems;
   (9)   Capping/closure construction activities; and
   (10)   Service or handling charges for subcontracted remediation contracting
activities.
Reg. 3.07-115.1. Computer hardware, software, and data services.
(a)   Definitions.
   (1)   "Computer Hardware" (also called "computer equipment" or
"peripherals") is the components and accessories which constitute the physical
computer assembly, including but not limited to: central processing unit,
keyboard, console, monitor, memory unit, disk drive, tape drive or reader,
terminal, printer, plotter, modem, document sorter, optical reader and/or
digitizer, network.
   (2)   "Computer Software" (also called "computer program") is tangible
personal property, and includes:
      (A)   "Operating Program (Software)" (also called "executive program
(software)"), which is the programming system or technical language upon which
or by means of which the basic operating procedures of the computer are
recorded. The operating program serves as an interface with user applied
programs and allows the user to access the computer's processing capabilities.
      (B)   "Applied Program (Software)", which is the programming system or
technical language (including the tape, disk, cards, or other medium upon which
such language or program is recorded) designed either for application in a
specialized use, or upon which or by means of which a plan for the solution of
a particular problem is based. Typically, applied programs can be transferred
from one computer to another via storage media. Examples of applied programs
include: payroll processing, general ledger, sales data, spreadsheet, word
processing, and data management programs.
   (3)   "Storage Medium" is any hard disk, compact disk, floppy disk,
diskette, diskpack, magnetic tape, cards, or other medium used for storage of
information in a form readable by a computer, but not including the memory of
the computer itself.
   (4)   A "Terminal Arrangement" (also called "'on-line' arrangement") is any
agreement allowing access to a remote central processing unit through
telecommunications via hardware.
   (5)   A "Computer Services Agreement" (also called "data services
agreement") is an agreement allowing access to a computer through a third-party
operator.
(b)   For the purposes of this Chapter, transfer of title and possession of the
following are deemed sales of tangible personal property and any other transfer
of title, possession, or right to use for a consideration of the following is
deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property:
   (1)   Computer hardware or storage media. Rental, leasing, or licensing for
use of computer hardware or storage media includes the lessee's use of such
hardware or storage media on the lessor's premises.
   (2)   Computer software which is not custom computer programming. Such
prewritten ("canned") programs may be transferred to a customer in the form of
punched cards, magnetic tape, or other storage medium, or by listing the
program instructions on coding sheets. Transfer is deemed to have occurred
whether title to the storage medium upon which the program is recorded, coded,
or punched passes to the customer or the program is recorded, coded, or punched
on storage medium furnished by the customer. Gross income from the transfer of
such prewritten programs includes:
      (A)   The entire amount charged to the customer for the sale, rental,
lease, or license for use of the storage medium or coding sheets on which or
into which the prewritten program has been recorded, coded, or punched.
      (B)   The entire amount charged for the temporary transfer or possession
of a prewritten program to be directly used or to be recorded, coded, or
punched by the customer on the customer's premises.
      (C)   License fees, royalty fees, or program design fees; any fee present
or future, whether for a period of minimum use or of use for extended periods,
relating to the use of a prewritten program.
      (D)   The entire amount charged for transfer of a prewritten ("canned")
program by remote telecommunications from the transferor's place of business to
or through the customer's computer.
      (E)   Any charge for the purchase of a maintenance contract which
entitles the customer to receive storage media on which prewritten program
improvements or error corrections have been recorded or to receive telephone or
on-site consultation services, provided that:
(i)   If such maintenance contract is not optional with the customer, then the
charges for the maintenance contract, including the consultation services, are
deemed gross income from the transfer of the prewritten program.
(ii)   If such maintenance contract is optional with the customer but the
customer does not have the option to purchase the consultation services
separately from the storage media containing the improvements or error
corrections, then the charges for the maintenance contract, including the
consultation services, are deemed gross income from the transfer of the
prewritten program.
(iii)   If such maintenance contract is optional with the customer and the
customer may purchase the consultation services separately from the storage
media containing the improvements or error corrections, then only the charges
for such improvements or error corrections are deemed gross income from the
transfer of a prewritten program and charges for consultation are deemed to be
charges for professional services.
(c)   Producing the following by means of computer hardware is deemed to be the
activity of job printing for the purposes of this Chapter:
   (1)   Statistical reports, graphs, diagrams, microfilm, microfiche,
photorecordings, or any other information produced or compiled by a computer;
except as provided in subsection (e) below.
   (2)   Additional copies of records, reports, manuals, tabulations, etc.
"Additional Copies" are any copies in excess to those produced simultaneously
with the production of the original and on the same printer, whether such
copies are prepared by running the same program, by using multiple printers, by
looping the program, by using different programs to produce the same output, or
by other means.
(d)   Charges for the use of communications channel in conjunction with a
terminal arrangement or data services agreement are deemed gross income from
the activity of providing telecommunication services.
(e)   The following transactions are deemed direct customer services, provided
that charges for such services are separately stated and maintained as provided
by Regulation
3.07-100.2(e):
   (1)   "Custom (Computer) Programming", which is any computer software which
is written or prepared for a single customer, including those services
represented by separately stated charges for the modification of existing
prewritten programs.
      (A)   Custom computer programming is deemed a professional service
regardless of the form in which the programming is transferred.
      (B)   Custom programming includes such programming performed in
connection with the sale, rental, lease, or license for use of computer
hardware, provided that the charges for such are separately stated from the
charges for the hardware.
      (C)   Custom computer programming includes a program prepared to the
special order of a customer who will use the program to produce copies of the
program for sale, rental, lease, or license. The subsequent sale, rental,
lease, or license of such a program is deemed the sale, rental, lease, or
license of a prewritten program.
   (2)   Training services related to computer hardware or software, provided
further that:
      (A)   The provider of such training services is deemed the ultimate
consumer of all tangible personal property used in training others or provided
to such trainees without separately itemized charge for the materials provided.
      (B)   Training deemed a direct customer service does not include:
         (i)   Training materials, books, manuals, etc. furnished to customers
for a charge separate from the charge for training services.
         (ii)   Training provided to customers without separate charge as part
of the sale, rental, lease, or license of computer hardware or software, or as
part of a terminal arrangement or data services agreement.
   (3)   The use of computer time through the use of a terminal arrangement or
a data service agreement, but not charges for computer hardware located at the
customer's place of business (for example, the terminal, a printer attached to
the terminal, a modem used to communicate with the remote central processing
unit over a telephone line).
   (4)   Compiling and producing, as part of a terminal arrangement or computer
services agreement, original copies of statistical reports, graphs, diagrams,
microfilm, microfiche, photorecordings, or other information for the same
person who supplied the raw data used to create such reports.
(f)   The purchase, rental, lease, or license for use of computer hardware,
storage media, or computer software which is not deemed custom programming is
deemed the use or storage of tangible personal property for the purpose of this
Chapter, and the amount which may be subject to Use Tax shall be determined in
the same manner as the determination of the gross income from the sale, rental,
lease, or license for use of such.
Reg. 3.07-200.1. When deposits are includable in gross income.
(a)   Refundable deposits shall be includable as gross income of the taxpayer
for the month in which the deposits are forfeited by the lessee.
(b)   (Reserved)
Reg. 3.07-250.1. Excess tax collected.
If a taxpayer collects taxes in excess of the combined tax rate from any
customer in any transaction, all such excess tax shall be paid to the taxing
jurisdictions in proportion to their effective rates. The right of the taxpayer
to charge his customer for his own liability for tax does not allow the
taxpayer to enrich himself at the cost of his customers. Tax paid on an
activity that is not subject to tax or that qualifies for an exemption,
deduction, exclusion or credit is not excess tax collected.
Reg. 3.07-270.1. Proprietary activities of municipalities are not considered
activities of a governmental entity.
The following activities, when performed by a municipality, are considered to
be activities of a person engaged in business for the purposes of this Chapter,
and not excludable by reason of Section
3.02-270:
(a)   Rental, leasing, or licensing for use of real property to other than
another department or agency of the municipality.
(b)   Producing, providing, or furnishing electricity, electric lights,
current, power, gas (natural or artificial), or water to consumers or
ratepayers.

personal property is available for sale by other persons, as, for example, at
police or surplus auctions.
(d)   Providing wastewater removal services to consumers or ratepayers by means
of sewer lines or similar pipelines.

Reg. 3.07-270.2. Proprietary clubs.
(a)   Equity requirements. In order to qualify for exclusion under Section
3.02-270, a proprietary club must actually be owned by the members. For the
purposes of qualification, a club will be deemed to be member-owned if at least
eighty-five percent (85%) of the equity of the total amount of club-owned
property is owned by bona fide individual members whose membership is
represented in the form of shares, certificates, bonds, or other indicia of
capital interest. A corporation may be considered an individual owner provided
that it owns a membership solely for the benefit of one or more of its
employees and it is not engaged in any business activity connected with the
operation of the club.
(b)   Gross revenue requirements. In computing gross revenue for the
computation of this fifteen percent (15%) rule of subsection
3.02-270(c)(1),
   (1)   The following shall be excluded:

charge, corkage and catering charges, and similar receipts.
      (F)   Locker and locker room fees and attendants charges if paid to the
club.
      (G)   Tournament entry fees other than entry fees for the one annual

Reg. 3.07-300.1. Who must apply for a license.
(a)   For the purposes of determining whether a license is required under
Section
3.03-300, a person shall be deemed to be "engaged in or continuing in business"
within the City, if he meets any of the following conditions:

principal or broker.
   (2)   He has or maintains within the City directly, or if a corporation by a

City under the authority of such person or if a corporation its subsidiary,
irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative
is located here permanently or temporarily or whether such person or subsidiary
is authorized or licensed to do business in this State or this City.
   (3)   He is soliciting sales, orders, contracts, leases, and other similar
forms of business relationships, within the City from customers, consumers, or
users located within the City, by means of salesmen, solicitors, agents,
representatives, brokers, and other similar agents or by means of catalogs or
other advertising, whether such orders are received or accepted within or
without this City.
   (4)   He is regularly engaged in any activity subject to the City's Use Tax;
provided, however, that individuals are not normally required to obtain a
license because they acquire items outside the City for their own or their
family's personal use and enjoyment.
   (5)   He is required to report and pay the tax upon Rental Occupancy imposed
by Section
3.04-440.
(b)   For the purposes of obtaining a Privilege License, a person who has less
than three (3) apartments, houses, trailer spaces, or other lodging spaces
available for rent, lease, or license within the State is not considered to be
regularly engaged in business and need not obtain a Privilege License;
provided, however, if that person is also receiving income from the activity of
renting, leasing, or licensing one (1) or more commercial properties or units

by Regulation.
   (2)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt for any other reason:
      (A)   The name, business address, and business activity of the customer,
and
      (B)   Evidence which would establish the applicability of the exemption

Reg. 3.07-350.3. Recordkeeping: out-of-City and out-of-State sales.
(a)   Out-of-City Sales. Any person engaging or continuing in a business who
claims out-of-City sales shall maintain and keep accounting records or books
indicating separately the gross income from the sales of tangible personal
property from such out-of-City branches or locations.
(b)   Out-of-State Sales. Persons engaged in a business claiming out-of-State

Reg. 3.07-360.1. Proof of exemption: sale for resale; sale, rental, lease, or
license of rental equipment.
A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for
rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to persuade
a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being acquired for
resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course of business. The
fact that the acquiring person possesses a Privilege License number, and makes
a verbal claim of "sale for resale or lease" or "lease for re-lease" does not
meet this burden and is insufficient to justify an exemption. The "reasonable
evidence" must be evidence which exists objectively, and not merely in the mind
of the vendor, that the property being acquired is normally sold, rented,
leased, or licensed by the acquiring person in the ordinary course of business.
Failure to obtain such reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will
be a basis for disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such

Reg. 3.07-407.1. (Reserved)
Reg. 3.07-415.1. Distinction between the categories of construction
contracting.
For the purposes of this Chapter, transactions involving improvements to, or
sales of, real property are designated into one of the following categories,
and these categorizations shall apply, whether or not a person designates
himself as a contractor, construction manager, developer, or otherwise:
(a)   A person performing improvements to real property is one of the
following:
   (1)   An "Owner-Builder" when the work is performed by the owner or lessor
or lessee-in-possession. An "owner-builder" may also be a "speculative
builder".
   (2)   A "Construction Contractor" when performing work for the owner or
lessor or lessee-in-possession of the real property, unless that person has
provided a written declaration stating that:
      (A)   The owner-builder is improving the property for sale; and
      (B)   The owner-builder is liable for the tax for such construction
contracting activity; and
      (C)   The owner-builder has provided the contractor his City Privilege
License number.
   (3)   A "Subcontractor" as provided in Section
3.04-415 (c).
(b)   An owner or lessor ("owner-builder") of improved real property is one of
the following:
   (1)   A "Speculative Builder" as provided in Section
3.01-100; or
   (2)   An "owner builder who is not a speculative builder" in all other
cases.
(c)   The terms "owner", "lessor", and "lessee-in-possession" shall be deemed
to include any authorized agent for such person.
Reg. 3.07-415.2. Distinction between construction contracting and certain
related activities.
(a)   Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with
construction contracting. Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving
equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting activity.
Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal property (with or
without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an operator shall be
deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property. For
example:
   (1)   Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving equipment with
operator is construction contracting. Rental of these items without an operator
is rental of tangible personal property.
   (2)   Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is rental of
tangible personal property.
   (3)   Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal property,
whether or not an operator is provided with the equipment rented.
(b)   Distinction between construction contracting, retail, and certain direct
customer service activities.
   (1)   When an item is attached or installed on real property, it is a
construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or
replacement of that item is construction contracting.
   (2)   Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are retail
sales.
   (3)   Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached or
installed are considered direct customer service activities (for example:
carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, landscaping maintenance).
   (4)   Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are considered
construction contracting.
(c)   Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real property is
considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. Examples of
consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air conditioning coolant,
but not paint.
(d)   Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has
independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.
   (1)   "Tangible personal property which has independent functional utility"
must be able to substantially perform its function(s) without attachment to
real property. "Attachment to real property" must include more than connection
to water, power, gas, communication, or other service.
   (2)   Examples of tangible personal property which has independent
functional utility include artwork, furnishings, "plug-in" kitchen equipment,
or similar items installed by bolts or similar fastenings.
   (3)   Examples of tangible personal property which does not have independent
functional utility include wall-to-wall carpeting, flooring, wallpaper, kitchen
cabinets, or "built-in" dishwashers or ranges.
   (4)   The installation of window coverings (drapes, mini-blinds, etc.) is
always a retail activity.
Reg. 3.07-415.3. Construction contracting; tax rate effective date.
(a)   In the event of a tax rate change, the rate imposed on gross income from
construction contracting shall be computed based upon the rate in effect when
the contract was executed, subject to the "enactment date" as defined in this
section. Gross income from a contract executed prior to the enactment date
shall not be subject to the tax rate change, provided the contract contains no
provision that entitles the construction contractor to recover the amount of
the tax.
(b)   In the event of a rate increase, in order to qualify for the lower rate,
the construction contractor shall, upon request, provide sufficient
documentation, in a manner and form prescribed by the tax collector, to verify
that a contract was entered into before the enactment date.
(c)   For purposes of this section, "enactment date" shall be:
   (1)   In the event an election is held, the date of election.
   (2)   In the event no election is held, the date of final adoption by the
mayor and council.
   (3)   Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this section shall be construed
to prevent the town from establishing a later enactment date.
Reg. 3.07-416.1. Speculative builders: homeowner's bona fide non-business sale
of a family residence.
(a)   A sale of a custom home, regardless of the stage of completion of such
home shall be considered a "homeowner's bona fide non-business sale" and not
subject to the tax on speculative builders if:
   (1)   The property was actually used as the principal place of family
residence or vacation residence by the immediate family of the seller for the
six (6) months next prior to the offer for sale; and
   (2)   The seller has not sold more than two (2) such residences (or, if the
residence is a vacation residence, two (2) such vacation residences) within the
thirty-six (36) months immediately prior to the offer for sale; and
   (3)   The seller has not licensed, leased, or rented the sold premises for
any period within twenty-four (24) months prior to the offer for sale.
(b)   In the event that a homeowner of a family residence contracts with a
licensed construction contractor for improvements to a residence, the
construction contracting on a family residence shall be presumed to be for an
owner's bona fide non-business purpose and all construction contractors shall
be required to report and pay the tax imposed on all such improvements.
(c)   Purchases by a homeowner of tangible personal property for inclusion in
any construction, alteration, or repair of his residence shall be subject to
tax as retail sales to the ultimate consumer.
(d)   "Owner" and "Homeowner" as used in this Regulation shall only mean an
individual, and no other entity, association, or representative shall qualify;
except that an administrator, executor, personal representative, or guardian in
guardianship or probate proceedings, for the estate of a deceased or
incompetent person or a minor, may claim "homeowner" status for such person if
such person would have otherwise qualified with respect to the specific
property involved.
Reg. 3.07-416.2. Reconstruction contracting.
(a)   "Reconstruction (of Real Property)" shall mean the subdividing of real
property and, in addition, all construction contracting activities performed
upon said real property; provided, however, that each of the following
conditions are met:
   (1)   A structure existed on said real property prior to the reconstruction
activity; and
   (2)   The "prior value" of said structure exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of
the "prior value" of the integrated property (land, improvements, and
structure); and
   (3)   The total cost of all construction contracting activities performed on
said real property in the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the sale of
any part of the real property exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the "prior
value" of the real property; and
   (4)   The structure which existed on the real property prior to the
reconstruction activity still exists in some form upon the property, and is
included, in whole or in part, in the property sold.
(b)   Except as provided in subsection (c) below, "prior value" means the value
of the total integrated property, with improvements, as existing immediately
prior to any reconstruction activity. Where, according to Title 42 of the
Arizona Revised Statutes, a property's full cash value for secondary tax
purposes is intended to represent the property's fair market value, "prior
value" shall be the property's full cash value for secondary property tax
purposes as determined by the County Assessor in the year immediately preceding
the year in which the reconstruction improvement(s) are or could have been
included in the County Assessor's valuation. If the County Assessor's valuation
is contested or appealed, the final determination at either the administrative
or judicial level shall apply. Where, according to Title 42 of the Arizona
Revised Statutes, a property's full cash value for secondary property tax
purposes is not intended to represent the property's fair market value, "prior
value" shall be the property's fair market value prior to the reconstruction
improvement(s).
(c)   "Alternative Prior Value" shall mean that as an alternative to the "prior
value" defined above, the taxpayer may use his actual cost of the reconstructed
property prior to the reconstruction, provided that evidence of such cost is
presented to the Tax Collector and is determined by the Tax Collector, in his
sole discretion, to be satisfactory. Such evidence shall consist, at a minimum,
of proof of the actual, arms-length acquisition price, accompanied by a full
appraisal of all property involved which appraisal shall have been performed by
a real estate broker or MAI appraiser specifically for the purpose of assisting
in the acquisition and further shall have been performed on behalf of the
seller or a lending institution which has lent at least sixty-five percent
(65%) of the acquisition price. (Only long term lending- not interim or
construction financing will be considered.) This alternative value shall be
used only if the property was acquired by the reconstruction taxpayer not more
than thirty-six (36) months prior to a "sale" as defined below.
(d)   A "sale" for the purpose of determining "alternative prior value" or
"reconstruction" only shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of the
execution of a contract of sale or a deed (joint tenancy or warranty) whichever
is earlier, to a purchaser or grantee of any single residential or other
occupancy unit. In addition to the foregoing, a lease with option to purchase a
single residential unit shall be considered a "sale" at the date of execution
of such lease if said option is exercisable by the lessee in not later than
nine (9) months. Further in the case of cooperative apartments, the sale date
shall be the date of execution of the contract selling (subject or not to
encumbrances, liens or security interests) of a share, or a sufficient number
of shares which entitle the purchaser to the occupancy of a residential unit.
In all cases a person shall include a husband and wife as a community, or any
co-occupants of a single unit as joint tenants.
Reg. 3.07-425.1. Distinction between job printing and certain related
activities.
(a)   Computerized Printing. Computerized versions of all items which would be
taxable under Section
3.04-425 if performed without computerized assistance are considered taxable
under that Section, and therefore, are not exempt services.
(b)   Book publishing. The printing of books shall be deemed job printing.
Sales of books shall be deemed retail sales.
(c)   Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not be
considered job printing for the purposes of this Chapter.
Reg. 3.07-435.1. Distinction between publishing of periodicals and certain
related activities.
(a)   Book publishing shall not be considered publication of newspapers,
magazines, or other periodicals for purposes of this Chapter. Sales of books
shall be deemed retail sales. The printing of books shall be deemed job
printing.
(b)   Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not be
considered job printing for the purposes of this Chapter.
Reg. 3.07-435.2. Advertising income of publishers and distributors of
newspapers and other periodicals.
Publishers and distributors of newspapers and other periodicals shall be
subject to the tax upon advertising imposed by Section
3.04-405 and such tax shall be allocated in the manner prescribed by subsection
(e) of Section
3.04-435.
Reg. 3.07-445.1. When the rental, leasing, and licensing of real property is
exempt as "casual".
(a)   The person who has less than three (3) apartments, houses, trailer
spaces, or other lodging spaces rented, leased or licensed or available for
rent, lease, or license within the State and no units of commercial property
for rent lease, or license within the State is deemed not to be in the business
of renting, leasing, or licensing real property, and is therefore exempt from
the tax imposed by Section
3.04-445 on such income. However, a person who has one (1) or more units of any
other real property is deemed to be in the business of renting, leasing, or
licensing real property, and subject to the tax imposed by Section
3.04-445 on rental, lease, and license income from all such lodging spaces and
commercial units of real estate even though said person may have fewer than
three (3) lodging spaces within the state.
(b)   (Reserved)
Reg. 3.07-445.3. Rental, leasing, and licensing of real property as lodging:
room and board; furnished lodging.

3.04-444 or Section
3.04-445. The charge for meals is subject to the tax upon restaurants and bars
prescribed by Section
3.04-455.
(b)   Furnished lodging. A person who provides lodging with furnishings shall
be deemed to be only in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing of
lodging, and not in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing of such
furnishings as tangible personal property, unless:
   (1)   Any tenant of any lodging space may choose to rent, lease, or license
such lodging space either furnished or unfurnished; and
   (2)   The lessor separately charges tenants for lodging and for furnishings;
and
   (3)   The lessor separately maintains his gross income from lodging and from
furnishings separately in his accounting books and records.
If all of the above conditions are met, such person shall report both sources
of income separately to the City.
Reg. 3.07-447.1. (Repealed Effective 01-01-2007)
Reg. 3.07-450.1. Distinction between rental, leasing, and licensing for use of
tangible personal property and certain related activities.
(a)   Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with
construction contracting. Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving
equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting activity.
Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal property (with or
without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an operator shall be
deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property. For
example:
   (1)   Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving equipment with
operator is construction contracting. Rental of these items without an operator
is rental of tangible personal property.
   (2)   Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is rental of
tangible personal property.
   (3)   Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal property,
regardless of whether or not an operator is included with the equipment rented.
(b)   Distinction between equipment rental, leasing, or licensing for use and
transporting for hire. The hiring of mobile equipment (cranes, airplanes,
limousines, etc.) is considered rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible
personal property whenever the charge is for a fixed sum or hourly rate. By
comparison, the activity of a common carrier conveying goods or persons for a
fee based upon distance, and not time, shall be considered transporting for
hire.
Reg. 3.07-450.2. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal
property: membership fees; other charges.
(a)   Membership, admission, or other fees charged by any rental club or
limited access lessor are considered part of taxable gross income.
(b)   Gross income from rental, leasing, or licensing for use of tangible
personal property must include all charges by the lessor to the lessee for
repair, maintenance, or other service upon the tangible personal property
rented, leased, or licensed.
(c)   Sale of a warranty, maintenance, or service contract as a requirement of,
or in conjunction with, a rental, leasing, or licensing contract is exempt.
Reg. 3.07-450.3. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of equipment with
operator.
In cases where the tangible personal property is rented, leased, or licensed
with an operator provided by the lessor, the charge for the operator shall not
be includable in the gross income from the rental, lease, or license of such
tangible personal property if the charge for the operator and the charge for
the use of the equipment are separately itemized to the lessee and separately
maintained on the books and records of the lessor.
Reg. 3.07-450.4. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal
property: semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible personal property.
(a)   The term "semi-permanently or permanently installed" means that the item
of tangible personal property has and is expected to have at the time of
installation a permanent location at the site installed, as under a long-term
lease agreement, except that the person using or applying said property may
eventually replace it because it has become worn out or has become obsolete or
the person ceases to have the right to possession of said property.
(b)   An item of tangible personal property is deemed permanently installed if
its installation requires alterations to the premises.
(c)   Examples of "semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible personal
property" include, but are not limited to: computers, duplicating machines,
furniture not of portable design, major appliances, and store fixtures.
(d)   The term does not include mobile transportation equipment or tangible
personal property designed for regular use at different locations or
customarily used at different locations, as under numerous short-term rental,
lease, or license agreements, whether or not such property is in fact so used.
   (1)   For example, use of a mobile crane, trencher, automobile, or other
similar equipment shall be considered a rental, lease, or license transaction
subject to taxation only by the city or town in which such business office of
the lessor is based.
   (2)   Other similar examples include, but are not limited to: camping
equipment, contracting equipment, chain saw, forklift, household items, invalid
needs, janitorial equipment, reducing equipment, furniture of portable design,
trucks or trailers, tools, towbars, sump pumps, arc welders.
(e)   A rental, lease, or license agreement which specifies that the item in
question shall remain, under the terms of the agreement, located within the
same city or town for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days shall
be sufficient evidence that such rented, leased, or licensed item is
"permanently or semi-permanently installed" in said city or town, except when
the item is mobile transportation equipment or one of the other types of
portable equipment or property described in subsection (d) above.
Reg. 3.07-450.5 Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal
property: delivery, installation, repair, and maintenance charges.
(a)   Delivery and installation charges in connection with the rental, leasing,
and licensing of tangible personal property are exempt from the tax imposed by
Section
3.04-450; provided that the provisions ofRegulation

contract in connection with the rental, leasing, and licensing of tangible
personal property shall be exempt.
(c)   Separately stated charges for repair not included as part of a warranty,
maintenance, or similar service contract relating to the rental, leasing, or
licensing of tangible personal property are exempt from the tax imposed by
Section
3.04-450; however, such income is subject to the provisions of Sections 3.04-
460 and 3.04-465, and the provisions ofRegulation
3.07-465.1.
Reg. 3.07-455.1. Gratuities related to restaurant activity.
Gratuities charged by or collected by persons subject to the tax imposed by
Section
3.04-455 may be excluded from gross income if:

the customer, and such amounts are maintained separately in the books and
records of the taxpayer; and
   (2)   Such gratuities are distributed in total to employees of the taxpayer
in addition to customary and regular wages.
Reg. 3.07-460.1. Distinction between retail sales and certain other transfers
of tangible personal property.
(a)   Charges for transfer of tangible personal property included in the gross
income of the business activity of persons engaged in the following business

   (1)   Tangible personal property incorporated into real property as part of
reconstruction or construction contracting, per Sections
3.04-415 through

construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or
replacement of that item is construction contracting.
   (2)   Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are retail
sales.
   (3)   Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached or
installed are considered direct customer service activities (for example:
carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, and landscape maintenance).
   (4)   Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are considered
construction contracting.
(c)   The sale of sand, rock, and gravel extracted from the ground shall be
deemed a sale of tangible personal property and not mining or metallurgical
activity.
(d)   Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real property is
considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. Examples of
consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air conditioning coolant,
but not paint.
(e)   Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has
independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.

the trading stamp company a retailer. All taxes imposed by this Chapter
applicable to retail transactions are therefore applicable to such exchange
transactions.

tangible personal property.
Reg. 3.07-460.4. Retail sales: professional services.
(a)   "Professional Services" refer to services rendered by such persons as
doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects, etc. for their customers or clients
where the services meet particular needs of a specific client and only apply in
the factual context of the client and the final product has no retail value in
itself. For example, opinion letters, workpapers, reports, etc. are not in a
form which would be subject to retail sales to customers. However, transfer of
items in a form which would be subject to retail sales (e.g., artwork, forms,
manuals, etc.) would not be considered professional services. The issue is one
of fact which must be resolved in each situation.
(b)   Creative ("idea") labor and design labor that do not result in tangible
personal property that will be or can be sold are deemed professional services
and, if charged separately and maintained separately in the taxpayer's books
and records, are not includable in gross income.
(c)   "Professional services" shall be deemed to include those items of
tangible personal property which are incidental to the services rendered,
provided such tangible personal property is "inconsequential".
   (1)   Incidental transfers of tangible personal property shall be regarded
as "inconsequential" if,
      (A)   The purchase price of the tangible personal property to the person
rendering the professional services represents less than fifteen percent (15%)
of the charge, billing, or statement rendered to the purchaser in connection
with the transaction, and
      (B)   The tangible personal property transferred is not itself in a form
which is subject to retail sale.
   (2)   In cases where the tangible personal property transferred is deemed
inconsequential, the provider of the tangible personal property so transferred
is deemed the ultimate consumer of such tangible personal property, and subject
to all applicable taxes imposed by this Chapter upon such transfer.
(d)   Examples:
   (1)   The transfer of paper embodying the result or work product of the
services rendered by an attorney or certified public accountant is regarded as
inconsequential to the charges for professional services.
   (2)   An appraisal report issued by an appraiser, reflecting such
appraiser's efforts to appraise real estate, is regarded inconsequential.
   (3)   Use of a hair care product on a client's hair by a barber or
beautician in connection with performing professional services is usually
inconsequential. On the other hand, if the barber or beautician supplies the
customer with a bottle of the product for the client's use thereafter and
without the professional's assistance, the transfer of the bottle of hair care
product is deemed not inconsequential.
   (4)   If a mortician properly segregates his professional services from
other taxable activities on his bill (invoice, contract), his gross income
would include only the income derived from the sale of tangible personal
property (casket, cards, flowers, etc.) and rental, leasing, or licensing of
real and tangible personal property. His charges for professional services
(embalming, cosmetic work, etc.) would not be includable in gross income.
Reg. 3.07-460.5. Retail sales: monetized bullion; numismatic value of coins.
(a)   "Monetized Bullion" means coins or other forms of money manufactured or
minted from precious metals or other metals and issued as legal tender or a
medium of exchange by or for any government authorized to do so.
(b)   Any coin shall be considered to have been transferred or acquired
primarily for its "Numismatic value" if the sale or acquisition price:
   (1)   Is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) the value of the metallic
content of the coin as of the date of transfer or acquisition; and
   (2)   Is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) its face value, in the
case of a coin which, at the time of transfer or acquisition, was legal tender
or a medium of exchange of the government issuing or authorizing its issuance.
Reg. 3.07-460.6. Retail sales: consignment sales.
Sales of merchandise acquired on consignment are taxable as retail sales. In
cases where the merchant is acting as an agent on behalf of another dealer,
sales of the consigned merchandise are taxable to the principal, provided the
merchant makes full disclosure to customers that he is acting only as an agent
for the named principal. However, when the principal is not deemed to be a
dealer, such sales are considered to be those of the merchant and are taxable
to him.
Reg. 3.07-465.1. Retail sales: repair services.
(a)   Fair market value of parts and labor charges. The Tax Collector may
examine the reporting of all transactions covered by this Section to determine
if an "arms-length" price is charged for the parts and materials. The
applicable tax may not be avoided by pricing a part, which ordinarily sells to
the customer at $10, at $5 and including the difference as "service" or
"labor". In the absence of satisfactory evidence supplied by the taxpayer as to
industry or business practice, the Tax Collector may use the cost of the part
or materials to the taxpayer marked up by a reasonable profit, to estimate the
gross income subject to tax.
(b)   (Reserved)
Reg. 3.07-465.2. Retail sales: warranty, maintenance, and similar service
contracts.
(a)   Gross income from sales of warranty, maintenance, and service contracts
is exempt from the tax imposed by Section
3.04-460.
(b)   Transfers of tangible personal property in connection with a service,
warranty, guaranty, or maintenance agreement between a vendor and a vendee
shall be subject to tax under Section
3.04-460 only to the extent of gross income received from separately itemized
charges made for the items of property transferred.
(c)   The gross income derived from a maintenance insurance agreement, which
agreement is entered into between the purchaser and any person other than the
seller is not subject to tax imposed by Section
3.04-460. If the provider of the maintenance insurance agreement pays for
tangible personal property on behalf of the insured in the performance of the
agreement, such sales are subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this
Chapter.
(d)   Charges for tangible personal property provided under the terms of a
warranty, maintenance, or service contract exempted under Section
3.04-465 are subject to tax as retail sales.
(e)   However, gross income received by a dealer from a manufacturer for work
performed under a manufacturer's warranty is not taxable under Section
3.04-460.
Reg. 3.07-465.3. Retail sales: sale of containers, paper products, and labels.
(a)   The sale of a container or similar packaging material which contains
personal property and which is transferred to the customer with the sale of the
product is not taxable as a sale for resale. Examples of such nontaxable
containers include but are not limited to:
   (1)   Packaging materials sold to a manufacturer of video equipment for
containment of the product during shipment.
   (2)   Cellophane-type wrap sold to a meat department or butcher for
containment of the individually wrapped or contained meat.
   (3)   Bags used to contain loose fungible goods such as fruits, vegetables,
and other products sold in bulk, where such bags or containers are used to
contain and measure the amount purchased by the customer.
   (4)   Shopping bags and similar merchandising bags sold to grocery stores,
department stores or other retailers.
   (5)   Gift wrappings and gift boxes sold to department stores or other
retailers.
(b)   Sales of non-returnable or disposable paper (and similar products such as
plastic or styrofoam) cups, lids, plates, bags, napkins, straws, knives, forks
and other similar food accessories to a restaurant or others taxable under
Section
3.04-455 for transfer by the restaurant to its customer to contain or
facilitate the consumption of the food, drink or condiment are sales for resale
and not taxable.
(c)   Where a retailer imposes a charge for gift wrapping and the charge
includes the container, paper, and other appropriate materials, the wrapping
charge shall be considered a sale.
(d)   Charges for returnable containers, where the charges are imposed on the
customer, are subject to tax at the time of the transaction. A credit may be
taken for the amount of refund after such refund is made.
(e)   The sale of labels to a purchaser who affixes them to a primary container
is a sale for resale and not taxable. Directional or instructional material
included with products sold are considered to be part of the product and a sale
for resale. However, the sale of items such as price tags, shipping tags, and
advertising matter delivered to the customer in connection with the retail sale
is taxable to the retailer as a retail sale to it, and is not exempt as a sale
for resale.
Reg. 3.07-465.4. Retail sales: aircraft acquired for use outside the State.
"Aircraft acquired for use outside the State" means aircraft, navigational and
communication instruments, and other accessories and related equipment sold to:

mobile in nature (for example, mobile telephones, portable hand-held two-way

effective date of the change.
(b)   The Tax Collector may postpone such approval to allow for examination of
the records of the taxpayer and may further require that all tax liability be
satisfied up to the effective date of the change.
(c)   Failure of the taxpayer to notify the Tax Collector and await approval
before changing the method of reporting will subject the taxpayer to interest
and penalties if his original method of reporting would produce higher taxes
due the City. When a person makes such change without the consent of the Tax
Collector, the Tax Collector may audit his books and records to verify the tax
liability as of the date of the change.
(d)   Any taxpayer who has failed to indicate a choice of reporting method upon
the application for a Privilege License shall be deemed to have chosen the
accrual method of reporting.

CHAPTER 3.30: EMPLOYMENT OF UNAUTHORIZED ALIENS
Section
   
3.30.010   Purpose and legislative findings.
   
3.30.020   Definitions.
   
3.30.030   Compliance.
   
3.30.040   Proof of verification of employment eligibility.
   
3.30.050   Compliance with applicable federal law sufficient to establish
compliance with the requirements of city ordinance.
   
3.30.060   Non-compliance.
   
3.30.070   Penalties.
§ 3.30.010 PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   A.   The City Council hereby finds that there has been an ongoing national
debate regarding the inherent inequities which exist between employers that
comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations in connection
with the hiring of their employees and employers that fail to comply with those
laws and regulations.
   B.   The City Council further finds and determines that these inequities
result in a financial disadvantage for those employers who comply with all
applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations in the hiring of their
employees while reciprocally providing an unfair financial advantage to those
employers who did not comply with the law.
   C.   The City Council also finds and determines that employer noncompliance
with federal, state, and local laws and regulations that regulate the hiring of
employees results in diminished protections of employees from unfair labor
practices and fosters the circumvention of minimum wage, prevailing wage, and
health insurance coverage requirements.
   D.   Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to provide a means of
facilitating and encouraging compliance with federal law including, but not
limited by enumeration to, the Simpson-Mazoli Act, also known as the
Immigration and Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) appearing at 8 U.S.C.
1101, et seq., by requiring businesses to verify that their employees are
legally eligible to be employed in the United States, and establishing an
enforcement mechanism at the municipal level against non-compliant businesses,
which the City Council finds will:
      1.   Help to promote the federal policy of requiring employers to verify
the employment status of potential employees;
      2.   Help to eliminate unfair competitive advantages between businesses;
      3.   Help to eliminate unfair labor practices and the exploitation of
workers;
      4.   Help to assure taxpayers that employers and employees are paying
their fair share of taxes by complying with tax laws.

receive discharges from the fixtures or equipment requiring pretreatment.
         e.   The city shall, from time to time, establish the maximum
quantities of certain substances, which may be discharged into the sewer system
or treatment works operated by the city. Discharge into the sewer system or
treatment works of any such substance in a quantity or concentration in excess
of that set forth in this chapter shall constitute a violation of this section.
      2.   Every building must be separately connected with a public sewer,
however, 1 or more buildings located on lots or parcels of land belonging to
the same owner may be served with the same building sewer during the period of
said ownership. If the property is subdivided and different ownerships are
created, sewer service can be provided by separate connection of each building
to the public sewer, or by an onsite collection system, which collects sewerage
from 2 or more buildings and conveys it to the public sewer.
         a.   Ownership and maintenance of the onsite collection system shall
remain with the property owner(s), under the authority of a duly created
property owners association, unless prior to approval/construction of the
onsite collection system, formal written request is made to the City Council to

hours or police department at other times. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective
actions.
            iv.   Follow-up. Within 5 days following notification, the
permittee shall submit to the Director a detailed written report containing
such information and describing the cause of the discharge and measures to be
taken by the permittee to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the permittee of any expense, loss, damage, fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the treatment works or any other person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the permittee of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
         b.   The permittee shall report all instances of noncompliance at the
time monitoring reports are submitted. The reports shall contain the
information listed in this section.
         c.   Where the permittee becomes aware that it failed to submit any

permit application or in any report to the Director, it shall promptly submit
such facts or information.
      3.   Bypass.
         a.   The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provisions of this section.
         b.   If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice, at least 10 business days before the date of the
bypass.
         c.   The permittee shall submit notice of an unanticipated bypass as
required in this section.
      4.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action
against a permittee for bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life or personal
injury, or to prevent severe substantial physical property damage, causing them
to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
substantial property damage does not mean economic loss by delays in
production;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The permittee submitted notices as required under this section.
      5.   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the 3
conditions listed in this section.

assigned or transferred without first obtaining the written permission of the
Director. Fees shall be assessed pursuant to the Master Fee Schedule.
   G.   Monitoring, recording and reporting of discharges.
      1.   The Department may, by order or permit, require the owner or
operator of any source of a discharge to:
         a.   Establish and maintain such records;
         b.   Make such reports;
         c.   Install, calibrate, use and maintain such monitoring equipment or
methods, including, where appropriate, biological monitoring methods;
         d.   Provide such other information relating to discharges as the
Director prescribes or as is necessary to determine the existence, nature and
frequency of any discharges.
      2.   The cost of all testing and sampling as may be required by the
Department shall be provided and paid for by the discharger.
   H.   Issuance, reapplication, modification, suspension and revocation.
      1.   The Director may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing,
modify, suspend or revoke any permit, in whole or in part, during its term for
cause or for failure or refusal of the permittee to carry out the requirements
of this chapter.
      2.   The Director may, upon request of the permittee, revise or modify a
schedule of compliance in an issued permit if he determines good and valid
cause (such as an act of God, strike, flood, materials shortage or other event
over which the permittee has little or no control) exists for such revision.
      3.   Permittee must apply for and obtain a new permit prior to the
expiration date of current permit. The application must be submitted to the
Department at least 90 days before the expiration date of the current permit,
unless written permission for an extension of the time is requested prior to
the expiration of the current permit and the Department grants the extension.
      4.   Subject to the Director's right to modify, revoke or terminate the
current permit, it shall continue to remain in full force and effect after the
date of expiration if the permittee has applied for a new permit in accordance
with the time frame required by this section, and a new permit has not been
issued prior to the expiration date of the current permit.
   I.   Variances. Any event in which average waste characteristics and
corresponding surcharge rate is disputed by a User granted a permit, the user
may be granted a variance by the Director under certain conditions. The
conditions are pursuant to City Code §
4.12.120.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.080 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER SAMPLING, ANALYSIS AND FLOW MEASUREMENTS.
   A.   All wastewater analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the
methods promulgated under Section 304(g) of the Act or 40 CFR 136. If no
appropriate procedure is contained therein, the standard procedure of the
industry or a procedure judged satisfactory by the Department shall be used to
measure wastewater constituents. Any independent laboratory or discharger
performing tests shall furnish any required test data or information on the
test methods or equipment used if requested to do so by the Department.
   B.   All dischargers making periodic measurements shall furnish and install
in a monitoring and sampling vault or other approved location a calibrated
flume, weir, flow meter or similar device approved by the Department and
suitable to measure the industrial wastewater and total volume. A flow
indicating, recording and totalizing register shall be required by the
Department. The discharger shall install and maintain facilities to allow
inspection and monitoring of the wastewater. The flow measuring facility shall
meet the requirements of city sewer system design.
   C.   The sampling, analysis and flow measurement procedures, equipment and
results shall be subject at any time to inspection by the Department. Sampling
and flow measurement facilities shall be such as to provide safe access to
authorized personnel.
   D.   When required by the Director, the owner of any property served by a
building sewer carrying potentially harmful or industrial wastes shall install
a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
measurement and sampling of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the Director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the
owner's expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.090 DISCHARGES.
   A.   The city shall, from time to time, establish the maximum quantities of
certain substances which may be discharged into the sewer system or treatment
works operated by the Department.
   B.   Discharge into the sewer system or treatment works of any such
substance in a quantity or concentration in excess of the established maximum
quantity shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   C.   An industrial wastewater treatment surcharge shall be paid to the city
on a monthly basis by those industrial wastewater dischargers whose
contribution of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS)
create costs in excess of the value of their sewer service charges. The
individual waste discharge shall be considered as creating cost in excess of
the value of their sewer service charges when the concentration of BOD and SS
exceed the following:
      1.   BOD: 275 mg/l.
      2.   SS: 200 mg/l.
   D.   The treatment surcharge shall be based on the appropriate city sewerage
system's total maintenance, operation, and capital expenditures for providing
industrial wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal services as described
in §
4.12.130. The annual industrial wastewater treatment surcharge shall be
computed by the following formula:
      Rate per 1000 gallons of water consumption =
      {'{'}RFLOW+[(RBOD)(CBOD)(8.34)]/1000 + [(RSS)(CSS)(8.34)]/1000{'}'}/1000
(Z)
 
      Where:
         RFLOW = Unit costs associated with wastewater flow per million gallons
per year.
         RBOD = Unit costs associated with BOD per 1000 pounds per year.
         RSS = Unit costs associated with SS per 1000 pounds per year.
         CBOD = BOD concentration in mg/l over 275 mg/L.
         CSS = SS concentration in mg/l over 200 mg/L.
         Z = The estimated ratio between wastewater flow and water consumption.
   E.   The quantity for total flow shall be the quantity of water measured at
the water meter. Where no meter exists, the surcharge will be calculated based
on 950 gallons per month per fixture unit.
   F.   1.   The quantities for BOD and suspended solids for certain classes of
users shall be based on typical strengths as listed herein:
BOD (ppm) Suspended Solids (ppm)
          BOD (ppm) Suspended Solids (ppm)
BOD (ppm)                                     Suspended Solids (ppm)

(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.100 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   Right of entry: inspection and sampling.
   A.   The Director, upon presentation of credentials, shall have the right of
entry to, upon, or through the facilities of any user to determine whether the
user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any individual
wastewater discharge permits, other permit, or order. Users shall allow the
Director ready access to all parts of the facilities for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
   B.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its facilities, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its staff so that, upon presentation of
credentials, the Director shall be permitted to enter for the purposes for
exercising all inspection and review authorities under this chapter.
   C.   The Director shall have the right to set up on the user's property,
and/or require the user to permit installation of the city equipment at the
user's expense, of such devices as determined necessary by the Director to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   D.   The Director may require the user to install monitoring equipment on
the user's property as determined necessary by the Director, at the user's
expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall always be
maintained in a safe and proper operating condition as specified by the

calibrated per manufacturer specifications to ensure their accuracy. Proof of
the current calibrations shall be maintained by the user and provided to the
city when requested.
   E.   User shall maintain their facilities to ensure the city staff have safe
and easy access and ample room in or near the monitoring facility to perform
independent monitoring activities and allow for accurate sampling and
preparation of samples and inspection. Any temporary or permanent obstruction
to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Director
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the user.
   F.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.110 ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIT CHARGE RATES FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER
TREATMENT SURCHARGE.
   A.   Unit charge rates "RFLOW," "RBOD," and "RSS" in the industrial
wastewater surcharge shall remain unchanged if no significant changes occur for
the sewerage system by the procedure described herein.
   B.   For the sewerage system, appropriate unit charge rate parameters for
flow, biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids, respectively designated
"RFLOW" (in dollars per million gallons per year), "RBOD" (in dollars per 1,000
pounds per year), and "RSS," (in dollars per 1,000 pounds of suspended solids
per year), shall be determined by the following method:
      1.   The total capital outlay for construction of sewerage facilities,
including debt principal and interest, shall be estimated and distributed among
the 3 parameters in accordance with the city's determination of the percentage
of the total existing capital facilities of the sewerage system predominately
related to each parameter.
      2.   The total operation and maintenance costs of the system shall be
distributed among the 3 parameters in accordance with the city's determination
as to which charges are predominately related to each parameter.
      3.   The sum of the capital costs and operation and maintenance costs
determined for each parameter in subsections B.1. and B.2. above, shall be
divided by the total volume of wastewater and weight of BOD and suspended
solids to be treated by the sewerage system in order to obtain the unit charge
rates "RFLOW," "RBOD," and "RSS," for the system.
   C.   The city may require industrial users to pay an additional fee, in
accordance with the Master Fee Schedule, to recover the costs of administering
the industrial pretreatment program.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.120 VARIANCES.
   A.   In the event that the average waste characteristics and corresponding
surcharge rate is disputed by a permittee, the permittee may be granted a
variance by the Director under certain conditions. A variance will be granted
if all the following conditions are met:
      1.   The permittee shall apply to the city industrial waste inspector for
a variance. The permittee shall state why a variance is being requested.
      2.   The permittee, at permittee's expense, shall provide supporting data
as outlined herein or as may be requested by the industrial waste inspector to
show cause why a variance should be granted.
      3.   The permittee shall sample the wastewater to determine
representative 5-day biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids
concentrations.
      4.   Wastewater sampling shall be for at least 3, 24-hour periods. The
periods shall be representative of the nature of the business and shall be
approved in advance by the industrial waste inspector. Samples shall be made up
of a 24-hour sampling period. The sampler shall have the capability to clear
the tubing prior to drawing a sample into the sampling container, either
manually or by automatic sampling equipment, with at least 1 sample collected
hourly or by automatic integrated sampling equipment approved by the industrial
waste inspector.
      5.   The sampling point shall be approved by the industrial waste
inspector. If no sampling point exists, the permittee shall construct such at
permittee's expense.
      6.   The analysis shall be performed by a laboratory approved by the
state.
      7.   The handling, storage and analysis of all samples shall be in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for Examination of
Water and Wastewater," as published by the American Public Health Association,
American Water Works Association, and Water Environment Federation and 40 CFR
136, as applicable.
      8.   Based on the analysis, a variance will be permitted if the resulting
surcharge rate calculated by the industrial waste inspector would result in
charges fifteen percent less than those using rates adopted by the city.
   B.   The permittee shall continue to demonstrate that a variance is
justified by performing the above analysis once every 3 years or when any
modifications are done to the structure requiring a building permit.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.130 RATES AND FEES.
   A.   User charges and fees. All properties receiving sewer service, whether
in or outside the city limits, shall be required to pay all sewer rates, user
charges, fees, and capacity or development fees as adopted from time to time by
the city. Properties outside the city limits shall also be required to pay any
additional fees as set forth in their Wastewater Service Agreement; in no event
shall sewer service be provided to properties outside the city limits at rates
and fees less than those inside the city. The City Council, pursuant to
Chapter 3.20, is hereby authorized to impose a user charge system for the
calculation of sewer user charges. These charges shall be revised on a regular
basis consistent with the adopted sewer user charge system per
Chapter 3.20. Sewer user charges shall apply to all property/facilities
connected to the sewer. For those properties located within the ban areas sewer
user charges shall be due upon connection to sewer.
   B.   Minimum monthly charges. In order to protect the investment made by the
city to serve all customers, regardless of water use/sewer flows, a minimum
monthly sewer charge is charged to all sewer system customers as long as there
is active water service to the premises. Sewer system customers for this
purpose are defined as all customers physically connected to the system. The
minimum charge shall be based on the formula adopted pursuant to the provisions
of
Chapter 3.20 and shall be revised on a regular basis.
   C.   Treatment capacity fees.
      1.   Imposition of a treatment capacity fee. A treatment capacity fee is
hereby imposed upon all facilities making use of the city sewer system. This
fee is based upon the projected cost of wastewater treatment facilities,
capacity associated with those facilities and the number of equivalent
residential units to be served by these facilities.
         a.   This fee shall be reviewed on a regular basis and be adopted
pursuant to the provision of
Chapter 3.20.
         b.   For the purposes of determining the treatment capacity fee all R1
Single- Family Residential properties shall be treated as 1 equivalent
residential unit (ERU), regardless of the water meter size.
      2.   Extended payment provisions. Certain customers will be permitted the
option of paying the treatment capacity fee over a time period as approved in
writing by the City Manager and the Director.
      3.   Payment. Payment of all fees shall be made for:
         a.   Existing developed properties within the city:
            i.   Upon connection to the system; or
            ii.   Within the 14-day notice period set forth in §
4.12.030.
         b.   Undeveloped properties within the city limits: no later than the
time of building permit issuance.
         c.   All properties outside the city limits: as set forth in a
wastewater service agreement approved by the City Council but in any event,
prior to the acquisition of a building permit.
      4.   Exception. For those properties located within the ban areas the
connection capacity fee shall be due in full at the time of application for a
permit for connection to the sewer system. The property owner shall also be
responsible for all permits, fees, and construction costs (except for cost of
sewer lateral from sewer main to property line arising from connection to the
sewer and abandonment of the denitrifying system).
   D.   Effluent charges. All properties receiving effluent shall be required
to pay for fees as adopted from time to time by the City Council, pursuant to
Chapter 3.20, or pursuant to a Reclaimed Water Agreement.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.140 SEWER SERVICE OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS; OBLIGATIONS OF WATER UTILITY
PROVIDERS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.
   A water utility company operating within the city limits shall provide to
the city reports stating the volume of water delivered on a monthly basis to
each of company's water customers served by the city's sewer system and
previously identified to the company by city in writing as being served by
same. A report shall be provided to city within the time frame negotiated
between company and the city's Administrative Services Director.
   Amounts of water delivered shall be determined and reported from company's
billing and meter records and may on occasion be estimated as a result of
customers not permitting access to meters. The city is authorized to enter into
written agreements with water utility companies providing service to sewer
customers of the city located outside the city limits to establish the
procedures for:
   A.   Notification of customer water usage;
   B.   Notification to customers of the water utility company of the
requirements of this chapter and the company's intention to terminate the
provisions of water service;
   C.   Termination of water service to delinquent sewer customers of city;
   D.   Re-establishment of water service to city sewer customers following
payment of monies owed to the city on a customer's delinquent sewer utility
account;
   E.   The agreement between the city and a water utility company may
additionally provide for the payment of a mutually agreed upon amount between
the city and a water utility company for the purpose of compensating the
company for lost revenues, as well as the direct cost incurred by the utility
in terminating water service to a delinquent sewer utility customer of the
city. City shall not be responsible for collecting delinquent water accounts
for water utility companies described in this section.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.150 INFORMATION SECURITY.
   Confidentiality of information. Information and data regarding a user
obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city's
inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without
restriction and are subject to release pursuant to public records requests.
When obtaining a permit, it is the responsibility of the user to clearly
identify in writing to the Director those items the user believes would qualify
as a trade secret or propriety information. The city will use reasonable
efforts to inform the user of public records requests, for information the user
has previously identified in writing to the Director as data involving trade
secrets or propriety information, prior to the city releasing that information.
It will then be the responsibility of the user to seek a court order to
preclude disclosure. The city will not be legally responsible for the
disclosure of information pursuant to federal or state law.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.160 EMERGENCY POWERS.
   A.   The Director may take any appropriate action against a discharger or
any combination of dischargers which the Director has evidence is presenting an
imminent and substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or
treatment works.
   B.   Whenever the Director finds that any person is engaged, or is about to
engage, in any act or practice which violates any provision of this chapter,
the Director may:
      1.   Issue an order to the party:
         a.   Specifying the provision or provisions of the code, permit, or
order alleged to be violated or about to be violated;
         b.   Indicating the facts alleged which constitute a violation
thereof; and
         c.   Prescribing the necessary corrective action to be taken and a
reasonable time for completing that corrective action.
      2.   Commence a civil action pursuant to this chapter.
      3.   Request the City Attorney to institute a criminal prosecution
pursuant to this chapter. Such remedies and sanctions for the violation of the
code, permit, or order issued hereunder, are cumulative, and the institution of
any proceeding or action seeking remedies or sanctions does not bar any
simultaneous or subsequent action or proceeding seeking any other of such
remedies or sanctions.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.170 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Director may seek injunctive relief in the appropriate court to prevent
the continuance or occurrence of any act or practice which violates this
chapter pursuant to City Code §
4.12.190 and §
4.12.200. Any other enforcement of this code is pursuant to the uniform code
compliance process provided
Chapter 1.12 of the City Code.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.12.180 TERMINATION AND DISCONNECTION FROM SEWER SERVICE.
   A.   Sewer service may be terminated by termination of water service or by
disconnection from the public sewer main or both.
   B.   No owner, operator, lessee or occupant of property shall connect or
reconnect to the public sewer before obtaining a permit to connect from the
Department. A violation of this section shall be unlawful and shall be a Class
1 misdemeanor punishable pursuant to this chapter.
      1.   Should such illegal connection be discovered, the city shall assess
against the property the amount of the treatment capacity fee, any permit fees,
prosecution costs and monthly sewer service charges.
      2.   For the purpose of determining the fees listed above, the city shall
assume that sewer service to the facility has existed since the facility was

as provided by the user.
   B.   Notification of mailing address. It shall be the user's responsibility
to promptly notify the city of any change in mailing address. Failure to
provide a valid mailing address which causes billings to be returned by the
postal service may result in discontinuance of service.
   C.   Minimum charges. First and final billed minimum (base) charges are pro-
rated based on actual services start and end dates.
   D.   Payment of bills. During each month the city shall mail a statement
covering charges for all water received by the water user during the preceding
month, which charges are due and payable immediately. If charges are not paid
by the 20th day after the date of the billing, they shall become delinquent and
a penalty of 10% of the amount of the bill shall be added. For each successive
20-day period that the bill remains unpaid, an additional 10% penalty of the
amount of the unpaid balance shall be added.
   E.   Payment under protest. A user may present a claim to the city if the
user believes they may have received an incorrect water bill. Such claim shall
be presented in person or in writing at the Customer Service Office before such
bill becomes delinquent. Such claim shall not exempt the user from delinquent
penalties if the bill is not paid on time. The user may make a claim following
payment of the bill and payment shall not prejudice the claim.
   F.   Discontinuance of service. 
      1.   When a bill becomes delinquent by 5 days, which shall be 25 days
after billing, the city will notify the user of the delinquency which will
result in discontinuance of service if not paid within 10 days. Users will have
the opportunity for a hearing before the discontinuance of service by
contacting the Customer Service Office.
The city may, without any further notice, discontinue service until all
outstanding charges are paid in full, including a charge for restoration of
service in accordance with the Master Fee Schedule.
      2.   A water user having a delinquent account on one premise may not
receive domestic water on a new or some other account on another premise until
the delinquent account has been paid, including penalties, if any.
      3.   Any person whose application for water is accepted becomes liable
for payment under appropriate rate schedule for all water and services
furnished by the city subsequent to the date stipulated on the application and
until such time as the user makes proper request to the city to discontinue the
water service. it is understood that the city delivers water through its works
and meters and charges for all water delivered through each meter.
      4.   Should the water service be interrupted or discontinued by the city
because of the failure of the user to pay the charges therefor, user shall not
have service restored to the premises involved unless and until all charges
which are delinquent, including penalties if any, have been paid in full. In
addition, user will be required to pay a deposit fee as set forth with the
deposit requirements in §
4.20.020 herein. Further, the City Administrative Services Director shall have
the authority to increase the amount of any deposit required based on a review
of delinquencies and non-payments relative to such user.
   G.   Meter re-reads. If the user feels there has been an error, the user may
request that the meter be re-read. If the reading is found to be correct, the
customer may be charged a fee for the re-read services in accordance with the
Master Fee Schedule.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.16.020 ADJUSTMENT OF BILLS.
   A.   An allowance for adjustments may be made on a leak, either for an
underground leak or where there is no discoverable cause for the excess water
usage. The adjustment will be calculated based on the excess usage caused by
the leak at the lowest rate step currently in effect. No more than two such
adjustments will be made to a user's account during a 12-month period. To be
eligible for this adjustment, the user must have requested the city investigate
the source of water leak within 30 days of the receipt that includes the
excessive billing due to a discovered leak.
   B.   For meter error. When a water meter is found to be out of order, the
charge for water will be based, at the option of the city, on one of the
following:
      1.   The average monthly consumption for the last 3 preceding months,
during which the meter is known to have registered correctly;
      2.   An estimate of consumption based either upon the water user's prior
use during the same season of the year or upon a reasonable comparison with the
use of other water users receiving the same class of service during the same
period and under similar circumstances and conditions;
      3.   On the consumption as registered by a substitute meter;
      4.   When a meter is covered or otherwise inaccessible so that it cannot
be read, an average bill will be rendered and accumulated errors, if any, will
be adjusted when the meter is first thereafter read as set forth herein.
   C.   Upon meter test.
      1.   When a meter is tested, as set forth in §
4.16.010 herein, and found to be registering more than 5% fast, another meter
will be installed and the city will refund to the water user the overcharge
based on corrected meter readings of the period the meter was in use, but not
to exceed a period of three months immediately preceding the request for the
meter test.
      2.   When a meter is tested, as set forth in §
4.16.010 herein, and found to be registering more than 25% slow, the city may
bill the water user for the amount of the undercharge based upon corrected
meter readings for the period the meter was in service but not to exceed a
period of 3 months immediately preceding the request for the meter test.

§ 4.20.040 PREMISES TO BE SERVED.
   A.   Separate premises. Separate premises under single control and
management will be supplied through individual service connections unless the
city elects otherwise. If the applicant wishes to utilize single service to the
various premises, a legal lot combination must be applied for and approved
prior to servicing the other premises.
   B.   Multiple units. Separate houses, building, living or business quarters,
or other uses on the same premises under single control or management, may be
served by either of the following methods:

will be rectified at the cost to the user.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.20.070 SERVICE SIZE AT LOCATION.
   A.   The city reserves the right to determine the size of the service
connection and its location in relation to boundaries of the premises to be
served. Customarily, a service connection will terminate at a point within the
city's right-of-way. The applicant is responsible to ensure that the correct
size meter is requested. The applicant must bear all costs associated with a
change in meter size after installation. The charge for an increase in meter
size shall be at actual cost using the fully burdened hourly rates for labor
and equipment, and the cost of materials. The charge for additional meters will
be assessed in accordance with the Master Fee Schedule.

public thoroughfare, the city at its option may provide a service connection of
conventional length terminating at some practicable location on public
property, and the applicant has the responsibility of providing a connection
thereto. The applicant's pipe to connect to the city's service connection
should not be laid until the service connection is installed. In the event the
applicant's pipe is laid prior to the time the service connection is installed,
and its location does not correspond with that of the service connection, then
the applicant must bear the additional cost of connecting the service
connection pipe with the applicant's pipe.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.20.080 APPURTENANCES.

the inlet side of the meter, for exclusive use by city in controlling the use
of the water through the service connection and meter and a check valve on the
outlet side of the meter, all within the meter box. If either, or both, of
these valves are damaged by the water user, the city shall have the right to
charge the water user for the replacement of the valves.
   B.   Meters. All regular and temporary (construction, etc.) service
connections shall be metered at all times. Customarily, meters will be
installed in public property adjacent to the curb or property line, but at the
option of the city, they may be installed on the water user's property in an
appropriate housing. No rent or other charge will be paid by the city for a
meter located on the water user's property, and the city shall have unimpeded
access across the premises to the meters at all times. Meters will be sealed by
the city at the time of installation and no seal shall be altered or broken
except by one of the authorized employees or agents of the city. If a meter is
damaged by a water user, the city shall have the right to charge the water user
for the replacement of the meter. Service connections are not to bypass the
meter.

relieves the city from exposure to liability from injury or damage. The user
will be responsible for the necessary repairs or liability associated with any
accident, injury or damage caused.
   C.   The user is responsible for obtaining written consent from the Director
if there is a request to modify, extend or add to the private connection.
   D.   If the city requests access to the user's property, for new
installation to the service connection or other works deemed critical to the
city, the user is responsible to provide access. This can be in form of
easement, right-of-way, or license for such installation.

(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.36.070 TEST—MAINTENANCE—RECORDS.
   A.   The customer shall test and service backflow prevention assemblies at
least every 12 months. If the testing reveals the assembly to be defective or
in unsatisfactory operating condition, the customer shall perform any necessary
repairs, including replacement or overhaul of the assembly, if necessary, which
will return the assembly to satisfactory operation condition.
   B.   If the Director or customer learns or discovers during interim period
between tests that an assembly is defective or in unsatisfactory operating
condition, the customer shall perform any necessary repairs, including
replacement or overhaul of the assembly, if necessary, which will return the
assembly to satisfactory operating condition. The assembly shall be tested by
an individual certified and approved to perform such testing prior to placing
the assembly back into service.
   C.   The annual testing shall be performed by an individual certified and
approved to conduct the testing by the PCCCHR USC, California-Nevada AWWA
Section, or ASETT Center, and recognized by the Director. A list of certified,
approved and recognized individuals will be maintained by the Director and will
be available upon request to all persons required to install or maintain a
backflow prevention assembly.
   D.   The customer shall maintain records, on forms approved by the Director,

(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.36.080 MODIFICATION OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   If the Director determines, after inspection of the customer's system,
that a backflow prevention method less restrictive than that required in
Chapter 4.36 will provide adequate protection of the public potable water
supply from the degree of hazard potential by the customer's water system, the
Department may, in its sole discretion, modify the requirements of
Chapter 4.36 accordingly.
   B.   Class 1 and 2 fire sprinkler systems of non-potable material installed
prior to August 8, 1991, may be given the option to retrofit with an
appropriate backflow prevention assembly immediately or perform a quarterly
flow and valve confidence test. Tests are to be performed by an appropriately
licensed contractor and results submitted to the Director within 30 days
following the inspection. Failure of 2 consecutive tests may result in the
immediate retrofit of the fire sprinkler system with an appropriate backflow
prevention assembly.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)
§ 4.36.090 DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SERVICE—NOTICE.
   A.   If the Director discovers that a customer has not installed a required
backflow, prevention method, or that a backflow prevention method has been
improperly tested or maintained, bypassed or removed, or that an unprotected
cross-connection exists in the customer's water system, the water service to
that service connection may be disconnected if the situation is not remedied
within the time specified in the notice sent to the customer as required by
this section. The service shall not be restored until the condition is
remedied.
   B.   Water service to a fire sprinkler system shall not be subject to
disconnection under this section. If a situation which would otherwise result
in discontinuance of water service in subsection A. above is not remedied
within the time provided in the notice sent to the customer, the customer may
be issued a citation for a misdemeanor offense. Each day the situation is
allowed to continue thereafter shall constitute a separate violation of this
section.
   C.   Prior to disconnecting any water service because a condition set forth
in subsection A. above exists, the Department shall send a notice to the
customer describing the condition and notifying the customer the condition must
be remedied within 45 days after mailing of the notice by the Department. If
such condition is not remedied within the 45-day period, the Department shall
send a second notice, by certified mail, to the customer notifying the customer
that water service will be disconnected in 15 days if the condition is not
remedied within such time period.
   D.   The Department may disconnect, without notice, water service to any
customer when the Department discovers that the customer's water system is
contaminating the public potable water supply or in the judgment of the
Department, such action is necessary to protect the purity of the water supply
or the safety of the water system. The Department's determination shall be
final and conclusive.
(Ord. 24-1330, § 1, passed 4-23-2024)

treatment of the animal. If at the conclusion of the hearing the animal is not
forfeited under this section, the court shall order the bond exonerated and
returned to the owner.

(Ord. 12-1088, § 3, passed 12-11-2012; Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)
§ 7.08.030 ISSUANCE OF WATER SERVICE LETTERS.
   A.   No water service letters as required by §
7.08.040 shall be issued unless there is sufficient water budgeted for such
uses pursuant to §
7.08.040 hereof, and provided further that budgeted water has not already been
committed pursuant to this chapter. Each water service letter shall state an
allocation quantity of water available for the new or expanded use for which it
is issued. Should this assigned allocation be subsequently exceeded due to an
unauthorized expansion, addition, or alteration to a property, the city may
terminate service to the property in whole or in part after proper notice and
hearing.
   B.   Water service letters will be issued by the city for applicable
developments in conjunction with the issuance of building permits, approval of
lot splits, and upon recording of a final subdivision plat with Mohave County
and the submittal of a guarantee of performance in an amount specified in
Chapter 13.20 of the Lake Havasu City Code.
   C.   Validity of water service letters. Water service letters issued by the
city pursuant to this chapter are subject to the following conditions:
      1.   Building permits. In order for a water service letter to remain
valid when issued in conjunction with a building permit, the applicant must
have been issued a building permit and must have begun construction prior to
the expiration of the building permit, which will be 180 days from the date of
permit issuance. Commencement of construction will be evidenced by an
inspection and certification by the city. Failure to commence construction by
the expiration of the building permit will cause the water service letter to
expire. If the building permit is revoked or canceled for any reason, then the
water service letter also is voided.
      2.   Lot splits and final subdivision plats. A water service letter
issued in conjunction with approval of a lot split or upon recording of a final
subdivision plat with Mohave County and the submittal of a guarantee of
performance in an amount specified in
Chapter 13.20 of the Lake Havasu City Code shall remain valid as long as the
newly created lots are recorded and construction has commenced pursuant to
building permits for at least 10% of the recorded lots within one year, 30%
within the third year, and 50% within 5 years from the date of the recordation.
Should the lots ever become abandoned, the water service letter is also thereby
voided. Except that buildings allowed under a duly issued building permit and
issued a certificate of occupancy shall be granted a water allocation in an
amount sufficient to allow the continued occupancy of the structure. Any
expansions or modifications to the structure or the use requiring additional
water shall require the issuance of a new water service letter.

§ 7.08.040 WATER BUDGET.
   A.   Under existing and proposed water service contracts, a total water
supply of 28,331.7 acre-feet per annum is available to the city for use within
its water service area. However, 2,139 acre-feet of this amount, as stipulated
in the current subcontract through the Mohave County Water Authority, may only
be utilized under normal Colorado River supply conditions when the projected
annual water demand exceeds the rest of the city's entitlement (currently
26,192.7 acre-feet). Water demands up to 26,192.7 acre-feet during normal
supply conditions will be budgeted by the city in the following way:
      1.   For all existing and future municipal water uses within the LHIDD:
16,000 acre-feet.
      2.   For water service pursuant to contract with Horizon Six Improvement
District, Sunset Mobile Home Park and Anasazi Pueblo, Incorporated: 331 acre-
feet.
      3.   For dedication of evaporative losses of the English Village marina:
12.7 acre-feet.
      4.   For all existing and future municipal water service outside the
LHIDD: 9,849 acre-feet.
   B.   When demand of the above volumes has been collectively met, up to 2,139
acre-feet of additional Colorado River water allocation becomes available for
water service anywhere within the city's entire water service area.
   C.   The establishment of this water budget is intended to account for all
annual consumptive uses of Colorado River water allocated to the city, in
concert with Reclamation contract provisions. The water budget set forth in §
7.08.040A hereof may be adjusted periodically in response to changing water
demands, water supply availability (including federally declared Colorado River
water shortages) and subsequent implementation of water conservation measures
set forth in §
7.12.010, §
7.20.020 hereof and in the city's Water Conservation Plan to make maximum use
of its water supply. The water budget does not constitute a guarantee of
availability of water for new uses.
   D.   The receipt or withdrawal by any person or entity of any Colorado River
water allocated to the city is conditioned upon payment to the city of any
applicable fees or charges and compliance with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations, including but not limited to the measures set forth in this water
allocation and management program.
(Ord. 12-1088, § 5, passed 12-11-2012; Ord. 10-1012, passed 9-28-2010; Ord. 96-

§ 7.08.050 COOPERATION WITH LAKE HAVASU IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE DISTRICT.
   The city will continue to cooperatively manage water supply, delivery and
management with the LHIDD for service to residents within the LHIDD pursuant to
the water budget set forth in §
7.08.040(A) hereof.
(Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)
§ 7.08.060 WELL REGULATION.
   A.   The city finds as follows:
      1.   Lake Havasu City is a party to Contract #3-07-30-W0039 with
Reclamation for the delivery of Colorado River water.
      2.   Reclamation has asserted a claim that all groundwater above the
accounting surface in the Colorado River Valley west of the Mohave Mountains is
hydrologically connected to the surface flow of the Colorado River.
      3.   Reclamation requires, as a condition of the water delivery contract,
that any groundwater withdrawn below the accounting surface within the water
service area be deducted from the city's contract entitlement to Colorado River
water and further, that a failure to report total diversion of Colorado River
water to the Regional Director of Reclamation constitutes grounds for
termination of the contract.
      4.   The city, in order to protect its contract entitlement and to
provide adequate service within its water service area, must adopt the
following measures applicable to all well drilling and withdrawal of
groundwater within the water service area.
      5.   The city reserves the right to contest Reclamation's claim regarding
what water is connected to the surface flow of the Colorado River.
   B.   Any owner of an existing water-producing well located inside the water
service area shall register the well upon a form provided by the city which
shall require the following information: description of the well location; the
Arizona well registration number; a copy of the notice of completion filed with
the Arizona Department of Water Resources; the maximum discharge volume
(gallons per minute) of the well; and on the fifteenth day of each month, a
full written report of volume of water diverted.
   C.   Except as specified in §
7.08.060D, no water-producing well shall be drilled or existing well modified
within the water service area, and no water shall be withdrawn from such a new
or modified well.
   D.   A temporary water producing well solely for construction operations may
be drilled only after securing a determination from Reclamation through
consultation with the city of the water table surface elevation at the location
of the proposed well site and an approved permit from the city that considers
the impact of the proposed withdrawal upon both water quality and quantity on
the city's water system; compatibility with city planning, zoning, and resource
allocation codes, regulations, and policies; and any subsidence effect upon any
neighboring property or any other properties subject to the cone of influence.
Permit validation length will be determined on a case by case basis, but in no
case shall such determination exceed 120 days from date of submission. At the
end of the permit period, the responsible permitted party shall abandon the
well within 30 days in accord with Arizona Department of Water Resources well
abandonment regulations.
   E.   Any permit issued pursuant to this section may stipulate that:
      1.   The permit is nontransferable without permission from the city.
      2.   The well shall be limited to a specified pump capacity and all
diverted water metered as outlined in the permit.
      3.   The well shall not be used for any purpose other than that listed
and approved in the permit.
      4.   The well's location and rate of withdrawal may not be materially
altered without prior city approval and amendment of the permit. In determining
whether to issue such an amendment, the city shall consider the factors set
forth in §
7.08.060D hereof and such other factors as are appropriate.
      5.   The owner shall agree in writing to all water conservation and
erosion protection measures which may be imposed by the city.
      6.   Permits for temporary water use which are due to expire may only be
extended by the approval of the City Manager upon application prior to the date
of permit expiration. Temporary uses of water shall be reviewed on an annual
basis to assure compliance with applicable conditions of issuance. Permits for
the temporary use of water may be revoked by the City Manager upon a finding of
failure to comply with conditions of permit issuance.

   Pursuant to code of Lake Havasu City §
1.08.010, any person found guilty of violating any provision of this water
allocation and management program shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not to exceed $1,000, or by
imprisonment for a period not to exceed 6 months, or by both the fine and
imprisonment. Each day that a violation continues shall be a separate offense
punishable as hereinabove described. In addition, the city may take such other
action as may be appropriate in responding to a violation hereof, including but
not limited to the termination of water service or capping of unauthorized
wells.
(Ord. 95-474, §, passed - -1995)
§ 7.18.020 ENFORCEMENT AGREEMENTS.
   A.   Generally. The city shall enforce the provisions of this water
allocation and management program throughout the water service area by all
appropriate means, including but not limited to cooperative enforcement
agreements with federal agencies or the State of Arizona and its political
subdivisions. With respect to the application of this water allocation and
management program within that portion of the water service area located
outside the city's boundaries, the city shall seek adoption of the program by
Mohave County through appropriate means, including but not limited to a county
ordinance or intergovernmental agreement or contract.
   B.   Enforcement outside city limits. Until such time as agreement is
reached with Mohave County concerning application of this water allocation and
management program throughout the water service area, the city will provide
water service outside the city limits only to parties who agree in writing to
comply with the provisions of this water allocation and management program and
water service rules and regulations.
(Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)
§ 7.18.030 OTHER REMEDIES.
   A.   Any use of Colorado River water within the water service area which is
inconsistent with this water allocation and management program will be
considered by the city to be not only a violation of any applicable city, local
or state law, but also an interference with the contractual relationship
between the city and reclamation and a violation of federal law. If
appropriate, the city will seek assistance from county, state and/or federal
officials to halt such unauthorized water use.
   B.   It shall be a civil offense for anyone obtaining water from the city
through an irrigation meter, to use such water for a non-irrigation purpose. In
addition to any civil penalties as imposed by the court pursuant to a finding
of violation, the city may, at the discretion of the City Manager or his or her
designee, refuse to permit the offending party to utilize irrigation meters at
the location of the offense or any other location.
   C.   Upon finding by the City Manager or his designee, based upon
substantial, reliable, and probative information that an offense has occurred,
the city may take such action as is necessary to prevent further misuse of
irrigation meters by the offending party, including but not limited to shutting
off or removing such meters. The finding and remedial action are independent of
civil prosecution of the offender.
   D.   Administrative review of denial or removal of meters or permits is
available pursuant to §
7.18.040.
(Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995; Ord. 03-707, passed - -2003)

pursuant to this chapter may, within 10 business days after receipt or notice
of such a decision, submit the matter to the City Manager or designee for
review. Review of the matter may be conducted in an informal manner and without
adherence to the rules of evidence required in judicial proceedings. The City
Manager may hold an informal hearing on the matter. The City Manager's decision
is final and shall be in writing, contain findings of fact and other grounds
for the final decision, and be delivered or mailed within 60 days of the
submission of the appeal to the party requesting review and to his or her
attorney of record, if any.

§ 8.12.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards and regulations for
various types of alarms of intrusions, burglary, robbery, fire and other
emergency alarm devices, whether by direct line, radio, telephone or other
means that require response thereto by the Police Department, Fire Department,
or other municipal departments within the city, and to provide for punishment
for violations of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13-1-1) (Ord. 13-1090, § 20, passed 3-12-2013)
§ 8.12.020 FINDINGS.
   The Common Council finds:
   A.   The majority of burglary, robbery and fire alarms to which the city
responds are false. Such false alarms result in an enormous waste of manpower.
There are such a large percentage of false alarms as may lull the police
officers into a sense of false security. In responding to an alarm, they will
probably assume it is a false alarm and may be wounded or killed by criminals
at the location;
   B.   Alarm systems which automatically and directly dial any emergency phone
number are very prone to be activated by current failures or other events
having no connection with criminal activity and tie up such emergency phones,
making them unavailable to receive genuine emergency calls;
   C.   The danger to citizens through emergency fire and police response
created by false alarms is unnecessary and hazardous;
   D.   The unnecessary waste of city funds/tax dollars through responses to
false alarms must be eliminated;
   E.   False alarms of any type have created conditions causing danger and
annoyance to the general public.
(Prior Code, § 13-1-2) (Ord. 13-1090, § 21, passed 3-12-2013)

the police department personnel where a situation requiring said response does
not exist. It does not include activation for testing purposes when the police
department is given sufficient warning of such testing. If an alarm response is
cancelled, resulting in police department personnel not reaching the premises,
the activation shall not be considered a false alarm. Alarm conditions created
by violent conditions of nature will not be considered a false alarm.

controlled by the city. An audible alarm shall terminate its operation or the
audible alarm shall reset automatically within 15 minutes of its being

§ 8.22.010 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   In A.R.S. § 48-3610, the Arizona State Legislature enabled the City of Lake
Havasu City to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3603 designed
to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, does ordain as
follows.
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed - -1991)
§ 8.22.020 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Lake Havasu City are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
   B.   These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage, also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed - -1991)
§ 8.22.030 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas
caused by flooding;
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard;
   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   I.   Maintain eligibility for disaster relief.
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed --1991)
§ 8.22.040 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting
local laws, ordinances and codes. In order to accomplish its purposes, this
chapter includes methods and provisions to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

funds have been authorized; appropriated and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent the
area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of
the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
   LL.   FLOOD-RELATED EROSION. The collapse or subsidence of land along the
shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by
waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly

8.22.280 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must no cause fraud
on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City
Council of Lake Havasu City will consider the fact that every newly constructed
building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the
community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed
below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased
risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the
community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and
suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners
may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

   TT.   HARDSHIP. As related to §§
8.22.260 to
8.22.280 of this chapter, meaning the exceptional hardship that would result
from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council of Lake Havasu
City requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   UU.   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   VV.   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

either:
         a.   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         b.   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   WW.   LEVEE.  A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed
and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain,
control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   XX.   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   YY.   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
the basement. See "Basement." An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure,
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor,
provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   ZZ.   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in 1 or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence.
   Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from
those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered
only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent
professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the
differences.
   CCC.   MEAN SEA LEVEL.  For purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American

structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   EEE.   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the

projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   GGG.   ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD or 100-YEAR FLOOD. The flood having a 1%
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. See "Base flood."

   SSS.   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and other
proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement
of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on
a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed
50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or
      2.   Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on 2 separate
occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of
each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive
loss."
   VVV.   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."

§ 8.22.220 ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS, INCLUDING SUBDIVISIONS.
   A.   All new subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions), greater than 50 lots
or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, shall:
      1.   Identify the area of the special flood hazard area and the elevation
of the base flood.
      2.   Identify on the final plans the elevation(s) of proposed structure
(s) and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the final
lowest floor and grade elevations shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   B.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   C.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
   D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall provide
adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazard.

§ 8.22.230 STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   All manufactured homes that are placed on site or substantially improved
shall:
   A.   Be elevated so that the bottom of the structural frame or the lowest
point of any attached appliances, whichever is lower, is at or above the
regulatory flood elevation; and
   B.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

§ 8.22.250 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
8.22.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
   A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
   B.   If §
8.22.250 is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §
8.22.190.
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed - -1991)
§ 8.22.260 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   A.   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. This unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
   B.   It is the duty of the City Council of Lake Havasu City to help protect
its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are
so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements
in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly
limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more
detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can
be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations
in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-08)
§ 8.22.270 APPEAL BOARD.
   A.   The Floodplain Board of the City of Lake Havasu City shall hear and
decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
   B.   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.
   C.   In passing upon such applications, the Floodplain Board shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use,
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges.
   D.   Upon consideration of the factors of §
8.22.270.C and the purposes of this chapter, the Floodplain Board may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and
      2.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property; and
      3.   The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for
exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange
program provided by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2. A copy of the notice
shall be recorded in the office of the Mohave County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
   F.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed - -1991)
§ 8.22.280 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   A.   Generally, variances may be issued for the new construction and
substantial improvement to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of §
8.22.180 and §
8.22.190 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   B.   Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration
of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   C.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   E.   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
      1.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      3.   Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it
is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only
facilities defined in §
8.22.050 of this chapter in the definition of "Functionally Dependent Use";
and,
      4.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

§ 8.22.290 COLORADO RIVER FLOODWAY.
   Since the Colorado River Floodway has, under flood conditions, proven to be
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply to the Colorado River Floodway, in addition to the basic requirements of
§
8.22.180 and §
8.22.190:
   A.   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development are prohibited. Necessary river control,
water conservation, power, water quality structures and related works, and
improvements and alterations to approved structures associated with allowed
uses of the floodway under § 8.22.290.B are excluded from this prohibition if
they follow the NFIP Floodway Revision process described in the Code of Federal
Regulations at 44CFR 65.12 for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and the
proposed project is reviewed and concurred with by the Bureau of Reclamation
and approved by the community. Within 6 months of the completion of the
approved project, the as-built data for the project must be submitted for a
Letter of Map Revision to assure the accurate depiction of the Colorado River
Floodway on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
   B.   Allowed uses of the floodway may include functions and uses that serve
the public interest, that are compatible with the floodway operation, and that
will not cause a rise in the Colorado River base flood elevation. These may
include river control, water conservation and diversion, power and water
quality structures and related works; remedial or corrective actions including,
but not limited to, drainage facilities to assist in controlling adjacent high
ground water conditions caused by flood flows; public and tribal roads;
military activities; fish and wildlife enhancement projects; navigational aids;
emergency action assistance; public health assistance; compatible public,
private and tribal recreational developments such as parks, golf courses, docks
and boat launching ramps; and compatible agricultural uses that do not include
permanent crops which would constitute an obstruction to river flood flows.
   C.   The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed
development that is allowed by §
8.22.310.A. The proposed development must be reviewed and concurred with by the
Bureau of Reclamation to assure compatibility with the floodway operation prior
to approval of the permit(s).
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008)
§ 8.22.300 COLORADO RIVER FLOODWAY FRINGE.
   The following provisions apply in addition to the basic requirements of §
8.22.180 and §
8.22.190:
   A.   Fill, permanent structures or buildings, including residential
structures, may be placed or erected in the Colorado River Floodway Fringe,
provided, in the case of buildings, that the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basements) is at least 1 foot above the Colorado River Base Flood
Elevation.
   B.   Land may be filled, provided the top of the compacted fill shall at no
point be below the Colorado River Base Flood Elevation for at least 25 feet
beyond the limits of any structure erected or placed thereon.
(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008)
§ 8.22.310 FLOOD-RELATED EROSION-PRONE AREAS OF THE COLORADO RIVER.
   A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed
construction and other development within the floodway fringe area of the
Colorado River. Such permits shall be reviewed to determine whether the
proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-
related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise
aggravate the existing hazard.
   B.   If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related
erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be
relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating
the existing erosion hazard.
   C.   A setback from the floodway is required for all new development to
create a buffer and to provide access to the floodway for possible maintenance
and improvements work. The buffer may consist of a natural vegetation or
contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related
erosion hazard and erosion rates in relation to the anticipated "useful life"
of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and
climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open
space purposes, such as agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife
habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures
only.
   D.   A waiver to the setback requirements may be granted if it can be
demonstrated that adequate erosion and flow velocity protection can and will be
constructed and maintained, and provided that the erosion protection meets the
applicable parts of Volume 44, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 65.5(a)(6).
All plans for erosion and flow velocity protection must have the review and
concurrence of the Bureau of Reclamation and be reviewed and approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.

§ 8.28.010 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   Illicit discharges occur due to illicit connections to the municipal
separate storm sewer system from residential, business, industrial, or
commercial establishments. As a result of illicit connections, contaminated
stormwater, wastes, or wastewater enters into storm drains or directly into
local waters without receiving treatment from a wastewater treatment plant.
Illicit connections may be intentional or may be unknown to the property or
business owner. Illicit discharges to the Lake Havasu City stormwater system
can cause excessive discharges of pollutants to surface waters and groundwater.
These discharges can negatively impact public health, welfare, and the
environment by transporting and depositing pollutants.
(Ord. 14-1105, passed 1-14-2014)
§ 8.28.020 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for health, safety, and
general welfare within Lake Havasu City through the regulation of all
stormwater to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent
practicable as required by federal and state law. Unless expressly authorized
or exempted by this chapter, no person shall cause, participate in, or allow
the discharge to a public right-of-way or public storm drain system of any
substance that is not composed entirely of stormwater. This chapter establishes
authority to conduct and require inspection, monitoring, reporting, and
enforcement activities to address the prevention, identification, and
remediation of illicit discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
It is the intent of this chapter to comply with Arizona Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System regulations for stormwater discharges, to be consistent with
the stormwater quality provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act, and to enable
the city to comply with all applicable stormwater quality provisions of
federal, state, and local laws and regulations to ensure the future health,
safety, and general welfare within the city, as well as the protection and
preservation of the local environment.
   B.   The standards promulgated by the chapter are minimum standards;
therefore, it is not intended or implied that compliance with the provisions of
this chapter by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.

§ 9.30.060 SPECIAL NOISE SOURCES.
   A.   Amplified sound reproduction device. If the source of sound is an
amplified sound reproduction device, and the complainant states that the
rhythmic bass component of the music is disturbing within their residence, then
the noise enforcement officer may take sound level measurements from inside the
residence of the complainant. No person shall cause, suffer, allow or permit
the operation of any amplified source of sound in such a manner that it raises
the total sound level above the permissible sound level limits set forth in the
table in this section when measured inside the residence of the complainant.
These sound level measurements shall be conducted under the “C” band level with
the sound level meter set for “C” weighting, “fast” response. Such measurements
shall not be taken in areas which receive only casual use such as hallways,
closets and bathrooms. For the purposes of these measurements, the neighborhood
residual sound level is that sound level which is measured in the residence
when the sound source under investigation is not prominent, or in a room on the
same floor that is relatively unaffected by the sound source under
investigation.
 
Noise Zone Time Interval           Allowable Noise Level
I          10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 45 dB(C)
           7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 55 dB(C)
 
It is unlawful for any person at any location within the city or its
extraterritorial jurisdiction to create any noise or to suffer, allow or permit
the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise
controlled by such person, which causes the noise level on any property to
exceed the noise standards as a measured average over any 5 minute period of
measurement, or the noise standard plus 10 dB(C) at any time.
The measurement of noise levels shall be taken from the affected property as
deemed most appropriate by the responding officer. The measured noise levels
are based on the noise zone which is the source of the noise.
   B.   Sound trucks; loudspeakers; other sound amplifiers. It is unlawful to
play, operate or use any device known as a sound truck, loudspeaker or sound
amplifier, radio or phonograph with a loudspeaker or sound amplifier or any
instrument of any kind or character which emits loud and raucous noises and is
attached to and upon any vehicle unless such person in charge of such vehicle
shall have first applied to and received a permit from the Chief of Police or
designee to operate any such vehicle so equipped. Such permit shall be granted
unless the Chief of Police or designee believes the activity will disturb the
public peace.
   C.   Motor vehicle repair. It shall be unlawful for any person within any
residential area of the city to repair, rebuild or test any motor vehicle
(between the hours of 10:00 p.m. of 1 day and 5:00 a.m. of the next day) in
such a manner that a reasonable person of normal sensitiveness residing in the
area is caused discomfort or annoyance.
   D.   Schools, churches and hospitals. It shall be unlawful for any person to
create any noise on any street, sidewalk or public place adjacent to any
school, institution of learning or church while the same is in use or adjacent
to any hospital, which noise unreasonably interferes with the workings of such
institution or which disturbs or unduly annoys patients in the hospital;
provided that conspicuous signs are displayed in such streets, sidewalk or
public place indicating the presence of a school, church or hospital.
   E.   Watercraft. Noise emitted from watercraft as defined in A.R.S. § 5-310
shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Arizona
Administrative Code R12-4-516.

the concrete vendor or jobsite contractor/finisher. Activities associated with
the manufacturing, loading or pouring of concrete that are conducted within
manufacturing or industrial zones are exempted from this chapter.
      2.   All other construction; residential zones in or within 500 feet. All
other construction work shall not begin prior to 5:00 a.m. and must stop by 10:
00 p.m. each day from May 1 to October 15 and 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. each day
from October 16 to April 30 in or within 500 feet of a residential zone or at
such other times as authorized by permit.
      3.    Commercial and industrial zones. Construction work in commercial
and industrial zones not within 500 feet of a residential zone shall not begin
prior to 5:00 a.m. and must stop by 10:00 p.m. or it may be conducted at such
times as authorized by permit.
      4.   Delivery and drop off of construction equipment/supplies. Equipment
and materials may be delivered to a job site outside the listed start/stop
times only when care is exercised to ensure noise levels generated by such
activities are reasonable and necessary.
   C.   Weekends and holidays excluded. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
construction work shall not begin prior to 7:00 a.m. and must stop by 7:00 p.m.
and concrete pouring shall not begin prior to 6:00 a.m. and must stop by 7:00

by permit.
   D.   Permit. Construction work may be conducted at different times than
otherwise permitted herein if, upon application, a permit is obtained from the
Development Services Department. The owner of the property or contractor or
entity to whom the original building permit was issued is responsible for
obtaining this permit. In granting such permit, the director of the Development
Services Department shall consider whether construction noise in the vicinity
of the proposed work site would be less objectionable at night than during the
daytime because of the different population levels or different neighborhood
activities; whether obstruction and interference with traffic, particularly on
streets of major importance, would be less objectionable at night than during
the daytime; whether the kind of work to be performed emits noises at such a
low level as to not cause significant disturbance of the reasonable peaceful
enjoyment of the surrounding neighbors in the vicinity of the work site;
whether the neighborhood of the proposed work site is primarily residential in
character wherein sleep would be disturbed; whether great economic hardship
would occur if the work were spread over a longer time; whether the work will
abate or prevent hazard to life or property; whether the proposed early morning
or night work is in the general public interest. The Director shall prescribe
such conditions, working times, types of construction equipment to be used and
permissible noise emissions as the director deems appropriate in the public
interest. No permit shall be required to perform emergency work necessary to
restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity, work required
to protect the health, safety or welfare of persons or property or work by
private or public utilities when restoring utility service.
   E.    Revocation of permits; appeal. The director may revoke any permit
granted hereunder upon complaints based upon substantial evidence that the
construction work causes significant disturbance of the reasonable peaceful
enjoyment of the surrounding neighbors in the vicinity of the work site. Any
person aggrieved by the granting of a permit or the refusal to grant a permit
by the director may appeal the decision to the city manager. The city manager
will issue a final decision within 30 days of the appeal.
   F.   Stop orders. Whenever any work on a construction project is in
violation of the provisions of this section, the Development Services
Department may issue a Red Tag, which is a written request to stop construction
until the necessary corrections are made and/or permits are obtained.

§ 11.04.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, welfare
and economic stability of the community and establish a quality system of
public improvements adequate to support existing and planned development. The
city intends to fairly allocate the responsibility for the construction of
necessary public improvements to those developments creating additional demands
on such public improvement systems as such development occurs.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-1)
§ 11.04.020 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS DEFINED.
   Public improvements are defined as community facilities and services
necessary to serve a proposed development and to progressively implement
current master service plans. The improvements shall include, but not be
limited to, streets, sidewalks, water mains, fire hydrants, sanitary sewers,
storm drains, traffic controls, and such public rights of way necessary to
accommodate the improvements; the improvements being provided at service levels
and according to design standards and specifications contained in the document
entitled “Lake Havasu City Standard Detail Drawings” and its amendments;
consistent with respective master plans for the public improvements as may be
adopted by the City Council and in accordance with this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-2)
§ 11.04.030 DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   Except within R-1, R-2, A-1, A-2, R -A and RMH zones, no new building shall
hereinafter be erected, and no existing building shall be relocated or altered
so as to increase the total value or total floor area of buildings existing on
the site on the effective date of this chapter by 50% or more, as determined by
the building official, for the purpose of establishing the equitable fee due
under those codes established pursuant to the provisions of Chapter
3.20 prior to issuance of a building permit, unless concurrently with new
construction, relocation or alteration, public improvements as defined in this
chapter serving the building phase lot or parcel upon which a building permit
is issued shall have been constructed and dedicated to public use and accepted
for public maintenance. Where the construction, alterations, or additions
consist solely of the installation or replacement of mechanical equipment, off-
site improvements are not requirements of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-3) (Ord. 94-449, § 3, passed - -1994)
ARTICLE II. IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES

§ 11.04.050 IMPROVEMENTS PLAN REVIEW.
   A.   No building permit for construction requiring public improvements

undertaken until designed and engineered improvement plans and any necessary
construction and/or permanent easements have been submitted to and approved by
the city, an acceptable performance guarantee has been approved by the City
Attorney, and an off-site improvement permit has been issued. The following
steps shall be completed prior to issuance of a building permit:
      1.   Preliminary public improvements plans. Preliminary improvements
plans shall be included on preliminary site plans submitted to the Community
Services Department consistent with the City Code requirements, prior to site
plan review.
      2.   Final public improvements plans. Final public improvements plans and
necessary easement documents shall be included with final site plans submitted
to the Community Services Department and approved by the City.
      3.   Performance guarantee. To assure his or her full and faithful
performance in the construction of the required improvements according to the
approved construction plans, the developer shall file security acceptable to
the city in an amount equal to 100% of the approved estimate of the cost of the
improvements. Security may be provided in one of the following forms:
         i.   Personal bond. A personal bond cosigned by at least 1 additional
person. The developer and cosigners shall submit evidence of financial
responsibility and the financial resources of those signing the bond shall
provide a reasonable assurance of the ability of the developer to proceed in

         ii.   Surety bond. A surety bond executed by a surety company
authorized to transact business in the State of Arizona.
         iii.   Irrevocable letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit

Department as sufficient to cover the cost of improvements. Performance
guarantee deposits may be in the form of certificates of deposit that can be
cashed by either the developer or city, checks in the name of Lake Havasu City,
or credit card transactions. Upon acceptance of the required improvements, the
performance guarantee deposit shall be released to the developer; however, no
refunds will be processed within 15 business days of initial payment or
deposit. If the deposit is made in the form of a joint certificate of deposit,
any interest accruing on the certificate shall also be released to the
developer. Checks and credit card transactions shall be deposited to the city's
accounts upon receipt and a city check shall be issued to the developer in the
amount of the performance guarantee. No interest shall accrue to the developer
from checks presented pursuant to this section. The required improvements must
be installed, inspected, and approved by the Community Services Department at
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the bond or letter of credit or
extension thereof. In the event the developer fails to install all required
improvements prior to occupancy, the city shall call on the bond or performance
guarantee deposit to complete the improvements. If insufficient funds exist to
complete the improvements, the city may expend sufficient funds to complete the
improvements and developer shall be billed for the additional expenditures.
      4.   Improvements construction permit. Upon approval of the improvements
plans by the Community Services Department, the developer shall obtain an
improvements construction permit.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-4(A)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 1, passed 7-9-2013; Ord. 93-412,
passed - -1992)
§ 11.04.060 CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   A.   No certificate of occupancy for construction requiring public
improvements pursuant to this chapter shall be issued until the following steps
have been completed:
      1.   Monumentation. Prior to construction of the improvements, all
property corners and points of curvature and tangency shall be installed by a
registered land surveyor. The developer shall be responsible for the
preservation of the monuments.
      2.   Acceptance of improvements. Upon completion of improvements the
developer shall call for a final inspection by the Community Services
Department. Improvements will be considered complete when they have been
inspected and accepted by the Community Services Department, with certification
in writing to the building official that the required off-site improvements
have been constructed and all required easements have been accepted consistent
with approved plans. Upon city acceptance of required off-site improvements the
performance guarantee shall be released.
      3.   Improvements guarantee. At the time of city acceptance of the
improvements, the developer shall file with the city an improvements guarantee
in an amount equal to 100% of the full value of the improvements to provide for
the correction of any defective work becoming apparent or arising within 1 year
after final acceptance of the public improvements.
      4.   As-built plans. A complete set of reproducible plans showing the
required improvements as built shall be filed with the Community Services
Department upon completion of the improvements.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-4(B)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 2, passed 7-9-2013)
ARTICLE III. OFFSITE IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT
§ 11.04.070 OFFSITE IMPROVEMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS.
   A.   When, in the opinion of the Community Services Department, the
installation of any of the off-site improvements will create a drainage or
maintenance problem, or will be more effective if installed along with other
city planned improvements, the Community Services Director may require the
developer to enter into an offsite improvement agreement in lieu of the
installation of the required offsite improvements. Offsite improvement
agreements will only be used at the direction of the Community Services
Director. The only offsite improvements that will be included in an offsite
improvement agreement are street widening, curbs, sidewalks, and any drainage
improvements (i.e., scuppers, swales, culvert pipes, and the like) that are
necessary but will not function efficiently without other planned improvements.
   B.   The property owner shall enter into an offsite improvement agreement
with the city to pay for the required offsite improvements. A cash payment for
the improvements shall be made to the city in the form of a cashier's check by
or on behalf of the property owner in the amount estimated by the city for the
cost of the installation of such offsite improvements. City shall credit the
amount to city's Offsite Improvement Agreement General Ledger Account for
future public works projects. At the option of the city, all such cash deposits
shall be used to defray the cost of such installation of the required offsite
improvements.
   C.   When the Community Services Director determines that an offsite
improvement agreement is required for a property, the building permit and
permit to perform work on the public right-of-way for the development will not
be issued until such time as the cash deposit has been received and the
executed agreement has been accepted by the City Manager.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-5(A)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 3, passed 7-9-2013; Ord. 98-558,

§ 11.04.080 STREET AND SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS IN COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL
AREAS.
   A.   The City Council may grant a request for deferment of the requirements
of §
11.04.030 upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission for developments within commercial and industrial zoning districts,
provided the following requirements are met:
      1.   Developable land is within a planned development rezoning request
and is addressed within a development agreement; and
      2.   The property owner has executed with the city an agreement to submit
plans and commence construction of deferred improvements pursuant to §
11.04.030 within 90 days and complete the improvements within 180 days after
the receipt of written notice by the Community Services Director at such time
as it has been determined by the Community Services Director that 60% or more
of the developable land in the tract has been developed. The agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Mohave County Recorder and run with the land.
   B.   If the improvements specified above are not commenced or completed in
compliance with the Community Services Director’s written notice, the Council
may direct that the deferred improvements be constructed or completed by the
city.
   C.   Whenever deferred improvements are constructed or completed by the city
pursuant to subsection B of this section, the actual costs of the improvements
shall be assessed against the subject property. Any such assessment shall be a
lien against the property, and the city’s Administrative Services Director or
his or her designee shall cause the lien to be recorded against the property.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-5(B)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 4, passed 7-9-2013)
ARTICLE IV. STREETS
§ 11.04.090 CREATION OF A PUBLIC STREET.
   The creation of a public street shall be in accordance with provisions of
the Title 13 of this code and the provisions of the Arizona Revised Statutes.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(A))
§ 11.04.100 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   A.   Whenever any proposed development contains or abuts an existing or
proposed street which is either unimproved or of substandard right-of-way width
or improvement according to the transportation master plan, city specifications
and standards, and the standards of this article, the necessary right-of-way
shall be dedicated to the city prior to the issuance of a building permit for
the proposed development, and the improvements completed and accepted by the
city as consistent with the plan and standards, prior to the issuance of an
occupancy permit for the proposed development, subject to the following
exceptions:
      1.   Improvements to existing streets. Where a development abuts an
existing street, the improvements requirement shall apply only to that portion
of the street right-of-way located between the centerline of the right-of-way
and the property line of the lot proposed for development. In no event shall a
required street improvement for an existing street exceed a pavement width of
30 feet.
      2.   Proposed streets. Where a development includes or abuts a proposed
street, in no event shall the required pavement width exceed 30 feet.
      3.   Partial-width streets. Partial-width streets, while generally not
acceptable, may be created and/or improved where essential to the reasonable
development of the subdivision, when in conformity with the other requirements
of these regulations and when the Planning and Zoning Commission finds it will
be practical to require the dedication of the other portion when the adjoining
property is developed. Whenever a partial-width street is adjacent to a tract
to be developed, the other portion of the street shall be shown on the proposed
plan. Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the
objectives of partial-width streets.
      4.   Nature and extent of improvements. Streets required to be dedicated
and/or improved pursuant to this section shall be improved to city standards
and specifications and shall include curbs, sidewalks, and, where designated on
the appropriate master plan, bikeways. Catchbasins shall be installed where
required and connected to drainageways. Upon completion of the street
improvement, monuments shall be reestablished and protected in monument boxes
at every public street intersection and all points of curvature and points of
tangency of their center lines. Street signs on newly-created streets shall be
installed at street intersections in standard locations.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(B)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 5, passed 7-9-2013)
§ 11.04.110 GENERAL LOCATION AND DESIGN.
   A.   Generally. The location, width and grade of streets shall be considered
in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions,
and to the proposed use of land to be served by the streets. The street system
shall assure adequate traffic circulation and that it is convenient and safe.
Intersection angles, grades, tangents, and curves shall be appropriate for the
traffic to be carried, considering the terrain. Street determination shall be
coordinated with any need for utility locations.
   B.   Relationship to the future street system. Location of a street will
ordinarily be shown in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan and
future street plan refinement of the comprehensive plan. The arrangement of
public streets shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
existing streets in the surrounding area, except for deviations to meet a
particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance
or conformance to existing streets impractical.
   C.   Underground utilities.
      1.   In newly subdivided areas all utility lines, including but not
limited to those required for electric, communication, lighting and cable
television services and related facilities, shall be placed underground, except
surface-mounted transformers, surface-mounted connection boxes and water
cabinets, which may be placed above ground, temporary utility service
facilities during construction, high-capacity electric and communication feeder
lines, and utility transmission lines operating at 50,000 volts or above. The
developer shall make all necessary arrangements with the serving utility to
provide the underground services. The city reserves the right to approve
location of all surface-mounted transformers.
      2.   Provision for all underground utilities, including sanitary sewers
installed in streets by the developer, shall be constructed prior to the
surfacing of the streets. Stubs for service connections shall be long enough to
avoid disturbing the street improvements when service connections are made.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(C))
§ 11.04.120 GENERAL STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   A.   Street right-of-way and pavement width.
      1.   Unless otherwise indicated on the comprehensive plan or on a
separately approved future street plan, the street right-of-way and roadway
widths shall not be less than the minimum width in feet shown in the following
table:
 
Type of Street Right-of-Way Minimum (in feet) Road Surface Minimum (in feet)
Boulevard      84                             54
Avenue         70                             44
Drive          60                             42
Cul-de-sac     50                             36
 
      2.   Where conditions, particularly topography or the size and shape of
the tract, make it impractical to otherwise provide buildable sites, narrower
rights-of-way may be accepted, ordinarily not less than 60 feet. If necessary,
slope easements may be required.
   B.   Reserve strips. Reserve strips or street plugs controlling the access
to streets will not be approved unless necessary for the protection of the
public welfare or of substantial property rights, and in these cases they may
be required. The control and disposal of land composing such strips shall be
placed within the jurisdiction of the city under conditions approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   C.   Street alignment. All streets shall, as far as practicable, be in
alignment with existing streets by continuations of the centerlines thereof. In
no case shall the staggering of streets make a "T" intersection (or) be so
designed as to allow a dangerous condition. Offsets of less than 100 feet will
not be allowed.
   D.   Future extension of streets. Where necessary to give access to or
permit a satisfactory future subdivision of adjoining land, streets shall
extend to the boundary of the subdivision; and the resulting dead-end streets
may be approved without a turnaround. Reserve strips, including street plugs,
may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions.
   E.   Street intersection angles. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at
angles as near to right angles as practical except where topography requires a
lesser angle, but in no case shall the acute angle be less than 80 degrees
unless there is a special intersection design. An arterial or collector street
intersecting with another street shall have at least 100 feet of tangent
adjacent to the intersection unless topography requires a lesser distance.
Other streets, except alleys, shall have at least 50 feet of tangent adjacent
to the intersection. Intersections which contain an acute angle of less than 80
degrees or which include an arterial street shall have a minimum corner radius
sufficient to allow for a roadway edge radius of 20 feet and maintain a uniform
width between the roadway and the right-of-way line. Ordinarily, the
intersection of more than 2 streets at any one point will not be approved.
   F.   Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac shall be as short as possible and shall in no
event be more than 400 feet long. All cul-de-sacs shall terminate with a
circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius of 45 feet. The length
of the cul-de-sac shall be measured along the centerline of the roadway from
the near side of the intersecting street to the farthest point of the cul-de-
sac.
   G.   Street names. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets in the city, except for extensions
of existing streets. Street names and numbers shall conform to the established
pattern in the surrounding area.
   H.   Grades and curves. Grades shall not exceed 6% on arterials, 10% on
collector streets, or 12% on other streets. Centerline radii of curves shall
not be less than 300 feet on major arterials, 200 feet on minor arterials or
100 feet on other streets, and shall be to an even 10 feet. Where existing
conditions, particularly the topography, make it otherwise impractical to
provide buildable sites, steeper grades, and sharper curves may be approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission. In flat areas, allowance shall be made for
finished street grades having a minimum slope, preferably of at least 0.5%.
   I.   Protection from major streets. Where a development abuts or contains
Highway 95, an existing or proposed arterial, or a collector street, the
development design shall provide adequate protection for residential properties
and shall separate through and local traffic or, if separation is not feasible,
shall minimize the traffic conflicts. The design requirements may include any
of the following:
      1.   A parallel access stream;
      2.   Lots of suitable depth abutting the major street with frontage along
another street;
      3.   Other treatment suitable to meet the objectives of this subsection.
   J.   Median islands. Median islands may be used on arterial or collector
streets for the purpose of controlling access, providing turn refuges, or for
aesthetic purposes.
   K.   Curbs. Curbs shall be installed on both sides of public streets and
shall be at least 6 inches in height.
   L.   Transit facilities. New developments along existing or proposed transit
routes may be required to provide areas and facilities for bus turnouts,
shelters, and other transit-related facilities needed to serve the development.
   M.   Traffic controls. The Community Services Department may require that
the owner complete a competent engineering traffic impact analysis to determine
the number and types of traffic controls (traffic lights, signs, turn lanes) as
may be necessary to accommodate anticipated traffic flow and that will be
required by the city as a condition of issuance of a building permit. The
analysis will be completed according to specifications established by the city.
Review and approval of the analysis by the Community Services Director shall be
required prior to issuance of a construction permit.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(D)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 6, passed 7-9-2013)
§ 11.04.130 PRIVATE STREETS.
   A private street is permitted only if provisions are made to assure private
responsibility for future maintenance. A street held for private use shall be
distinguished from public streets and any reservations or restrictions relating
to the private street shall be described in the land division documents and the
deed records.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(E))
ARTICLE V. WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION
§ 11.04.140 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   Water lines and fire hydrants serving each building site in a proposed
development shall be available or installed so as to connect to existing mains.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-9(A))
§ 11.04.150 GENERAL WATER SYSTEM DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Potable water supply. Water lines providing potable water supplies to
new development shall be installed at a size capacity and pressure consistent
with the water service master plan; Arizona Department of Environmental
Quality; and the Lake Havasu irrigation and drainage district standards and
specifications in order to adequately serve the proposed development.
   B.   Fire protection. All new development shall comply with the fire
protection requirements of Article VI of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-9(B)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 7, passed 7-9-2013)
ARTICLE VI. FIRE PROTECTION FACILITIES
§ 11.04.160 GENERALLY.
   A consultation with the Fire Department should be arranged early in the
development review process to avoid costly revamping of plans or ideas. The
following items are general design requirements. Specific requirements are to
be determined in consultations with the Fire Department and shall be consistent
with all applicable codes administered by the Department.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-6 (part))
§ 11.04.170 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   A.   An approved water supply capable of supplying required fire flow for
fire protection shall be provided to all premises upon which buildings or
portions of buildings are hereafter constructed. When any portion of the
building protected is in excess of 150 feet from a water supply on a public
street, there shall be provided, when required by the Chief, on-site fire
hydrants and mains capable of supplying the required fire flow.
   B.   The Fire Chief may prescribe that the development include installation
of such on-site fire-protection facilities as in his or her judgment are
necessary to provide an adequate water supply on the land to be developed. The
installation shall be at the expense of the owner or developer.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-6(A)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 8, passed 7-9-2013)
§ 11.04.180 GENERAL FIRE PROTECTION FACILITY STANDARDS.
   A.   All facilities required to be installed under this article shall be
approved by and meet the specifications of the Fire Chief and the Community
Services Director as to location, size and type of materials, and manner of
installation.
      1.   Water supply.
         i.   Minimum fire flow.
            a.   Standards published by the Insurance Services Office, entitled
"Guide for Determination of Required Fire Flows" and the provisions of
International Fire Code shall serve as a guide to determine capacity of
facilities required to furnish an adequate water supply to individual buildings
and is hereby included by reference within this subsection.
            b.   The fire protection facilities shall be adequate to convey the
required quantity of water, as determined by the above-cited standards, to any
outlet in the system; with no less than 20 pounds per square inch residual
pressure at the outlet being considered, with the required quantity of water
flowing.
      2.   Access to fire protection facilities. Whenever any hydrant or other
appurtenance for use by the Fire Department is required to be installed under
the provisions of this section, there shall be included in the improvements
plan, and delineated thereon, adequate provisions for access to and from every
such hydrant and appurtenance by firefighting equipment. Such access shall be
in the form of an improved, permanently-maintained roadway or of an open paved
area, or any combination thereof, designed, constructed and at all times
maintained in such a manner that there shall be an accessway kept clear and
unobstructed at such grades, and having sufficient width and height clearance,
as to permit ingress and egress by firefighting equipment. With respect to
hydrants located along private accessways where curbs exist, the curbs shall be
painted red by the owner, lessee, or other person in charge of the premises to
prohibit parking for a distance of 15 feet in either direction from any
hydrant. In such cases where curbs do not exist, there shall be appropriate
markings painted on the pavement, or signs erected, or both, giving notice that
parking is prohibited for a distance of 15 feet from any such hydrant. If, in
the judgment of the Fire Chief, it is necessary to prohibit vehicular parking
along private accessways in order to keep them clear and unobstructed, he or
she may require the developer, owner, lessee, or other person in charge of the
premises to paint the curbs or install signs or give other appropriate notice
to the effect that parking is prohibited by the Fire Department. It shall
thereafter be unlawful for any such owner, lessee, or other person in charge to
fail to install and maintain in good condition the form of notice so
prescribed.
      3.   Timing of facilities installation. Facilities are to be provided
during the initial stage of construction. When it is deemed that firefighting
facilities are required to be installed, as required by this article, by the
developer, the facilities as may be required shall be installed and made
serviceable prior to or at the time any combustible construction begins on the
land, unless, in the opinion of the Fire Chief, the nature or circumstances of
the facilities makes it impractical to so require.
      4.   Maintenance of facilities. All on-site fire-protection facilities
shall at all times be maintained in good working order by the owner thereof. To
this end, the Fire Chief is hereby empowered at his or her discretion to
conduct periodic tests and inspection of the facilities. If the Fire Chief
determines that the facilities are not being maintained as required by this
article, he or she may order that the owner or lessee of the land make the
necessary repairs or changes within 10 days, or such longer time as in his or
her judgment is reasonable. It shall be unlawful for any such person to fail or
refuse to comply with any such order.
      5.   Operation or modification of facilities. On site fire-protection
facilities may only be altered or repaired with the consent of the Fire Chief
provided, that such alteration or repairs shall be carried out in compliance
with the International Fire Code and accepted engineering practices.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-6(B)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 9, passed 7-9-2013)
§ 11.04.190 FIRE LANES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   A.   The Fire Chief may require that fire lanes for new and existing
structures be established on private or public property to provide access for
fire-suppression operations by the use of an improved public street, areaway,
parking lot, driveway or roadway.
   B.   A fire lane is an area, parking lot, driveway, roadway or portion
thereof that shall be:
      1.   Designated or approved by the Fire Chief;
      2.   Identified with red painted curbs or 6-inch-wide red stripe the full
length of the fire lane, or each fire lane shall have approved signs at the
beginning and end of the fire lane, with spacing between the signs not to
exceed 75 feet. The signs shall be approved by the Fire Chief and comply with
Appendix A, Standard Detail No.1 of this chapter. Each sign shall face in the
direction of oncoming traffic. Signs that identify entranceways only as a fire
lane area shall be identified with approved fire lane sign(s) on each side
facing forward, and area between the signs shall be red striped.
   C.   A fire lane sign shall be:
      1.   Affixed to a stationary pole or object;
      2.   Plainly visible;
      3.   Maintained clear of obstructions its entire length.
   D.   It is unlawful for any person to park any vehicle with or without power
within, or otherwise obstruct any fire lane except as may be specifically
permitted by the Fire Chief.
   E.   Any vehicle stopped or parked within a fire lane established,
designated, and marked in accordance with this article shall be issued a
“Notice of Ordinance Violation” by any member of the Lake Havasu City Police
Department or any representative the Fire Chief or Police Chief designates. Any
vehicle stopped or parked within the fire lane may be removed at the expense of
the vehicle owner. Removal of a vehicle under such circumstances may be
authorized by the person in lawful possession of the property or by the Fire
Chief or Police Chief or their representatives. The person in lawful possession
of the property shall keep designated fire lanes free of vehicles and all other
obstructions.
   F.   Fire lanes shall:
      1.   Extend to within 150 feet of an entrance to the interior or to a
point as approved by the Fire Chief for buildings 2 stories or less in height;

No. 2, see Appendix B to this chapter.
   G.   It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to post a fire lane sign
without the approval of the Fire Chief or his or her authorized representative.
   H.   Fire lanes established for new and existing structures shall conform to
fire lane requirements applicable at the time of construction, provided that if
no fire lane requirements were applicable at the time of construction, the Fire
Chief may require establishment of fire lanes to conform with the requirements.
   I.   The specific requirements for this article as applicable to a specific
structure may be modified by the Fire Chief in recognition of varying
occupancies, sizes and hazards of buildings and the provisions of other means
of access or fixed fire protection.
   J.   No person shall place or keep any post, fence, growth, trash or other
material or thing near any fire hydrant, fire sprinkler connection or fire
standpipe connection that would prevent them from being immediately discernible
or in any other manner deter or hinder the Fire Department from gaining
immediate access to them for use. Signs or red painted curbs or 6-inch-wide red
stripes the full length of the restricted area, prohibiting blocking the fire
protection equipment, may be required on private property installation.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-6(C))
§ 11.04.200 FIRE MAINS AND FIRE HYDRANTS.
   A.   Fire mains and fire hydrants shall be installed on private or public
property as approved by the Fire Chief or his or her authorized representative,
where city main and hydrant placement adjacent to the property does not provide
the required minimum fire main and fire hydrant coverage as set forth in this
chapter and as listed in subsections A(1) through (10) of this section.
      1.   Plans shall be approved by the Fire Department before installation
of the fire mains or fire hydrants. The installation of fire mains and fire
hydrants shall also meet the Lake Havasu City Water Division specifications.
      2.   Fire main size shall be of sufficient size to supply required fire
flow, but shall be such that no deadend fire main is less than 6-inch diameter
and no more than 500 feet long. LOOPED shall mean that the fire main is tied
into an approved city water main in at least 2 places with maximum separation,
but not less than 200 feet apart.
      3.   Fire hydrants shall be located within 150 feet of the most remote
exterior point of all buildings or hazardous areas. Fire hydrants shall be
placed in locations approved by the Fire Chief or his or her authorized
representative. The hydrant shall be visible and within 6 feet of the curb or
other vehicle access point.
      4.   Fire hydrant spacing shall be approximately 500 feet apart in
single-family residential developments and shall be approximately 300 feet
apart in all other developments. The distance between fire hydrants shall be
computed along the path of travel the fire truck must meet.
      5.   A fire hydrant shall be within 50 feet of all Fire Department
connections of fire sprinkler and standpipe systems. An exception can be made
with the approval of the Fire Chief.
      6.   All fire hydrants shall be standard Lake Havasu City spec hydrants
with two, 2-1/2-inch male outlets and one, 4-1/2-inch male outlet with NST
threads. The height of all fire hydrants shall be such that the centerline of
the 4-1/2-inch outlet is not lower than 15 inches above grade and no higher
than 30 inches above grade.
      7.   A clear space of 3 feet in all directions for accessible use shall
be maintained around fire hydrants.
      8.   Vehicle parking shall be prohibited within the area 15 feet in front

calculated by multiplying the certified cost per lineal foot of the line
extension by the total frontage of the lot making connection to the system,
measured in feet.
   C.   Frontage is the measure, in feet, of the property line which is
parallel to the right-of-way where the line subject to the payback is located.

ARTICLE XIII - LANDSCAPE FEATURES - GENERAL MAINTENANCE
§ 11.04.510 LANDSCAPE FEATURES—GENERAL MAINTENANCE.
   A.   Trees are recognized as providing very tangible benefits that promote
the health, safety, and general welfare to residents of Lake Havasu City. Trees
are a particularly valuable resource in retaining the attractiveness of the
city's resort character, thereby increasing and enhancing the economic
development and quality of life. Healthy trees serve as a natural buffer zone
between traffic generated by various land uses and the streets that serve them.
In addition, trees help enhance the visual and aesthetic qualities that attract
visitors and businesses to the entire city. Healthy trees reduce air and noise
pollution, enhance aesthetics and property values, and are an important
contributor to the city's image, pride, and quality of life. It is the intent
of this section to prevent the unnecessary removal of trees. It is not to be
interpreted as an expansion of landscaping requirements.
   B.   The Operations Director or his or her designee, shall have the
authority to promulgate the rules and regulations of the Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice governing the planting, maintenance,
removal, fertilization, pruning, and bracing of trees on the streets or other
public sites in the municipality, and shall direct, regulate, and control the
planting, maintenance, and removal of all trees growing now or hereafter in any
public area of the city, and shall cause the provisions of this section to be
enforced.
(Ord. 13-1096, § 19, passed 7-9-2013; Ord. 01-626, passed - -2001)
§ 11.04.990 APPEAL—VARIANCE.
   Any applicant may appeal for relief from the terms of these regulations to
the City Council, and the City Council may authorize variances from the terms
of this chapter where, by reason of an exceptional or extraordinary situation
or condition of a lot or parcel of land, the strict application of any of the
regulations enacted in this chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties or undue hardships upon the applicant. Such a variance
or relief may be given provided the relief may be guaranteed without detriment
to the public good and without impairing the intent and purposes of this
chapter.

         b.   Obtaining all required licenses, franchises and other permits
before any work commences; and
         c.   Ensuring that the terms and conditions of all permits, licenses
and franchises are strictly followed.
      4.   Where a facility is used by more than one permittee, each permittee
is fully responsible for ensuring that all requirements are satisfied.
      5.   Facilities shall be installed, constructed, and maintained so that
no additional costs are imposed upon the city and so that the facility does not
interfere with other uses or users of the public rights-of-way or city utility
easement. This subsection shall not serve to limit the requirement of any other
provision of this code or any license, permit, or franchise issued by the city.
      6.   A permit to work in the public right-of-way which requires
excavation of a paved right-of-way shall comply with this subsection, in
addition to other requirements of this section. A permittee shall be required
to be a participant in the regional one-call utility locating system (blue
stake). Permittee shall use paint that dissolves within three weeks. In the
event permittee's utility markings paint remains visible after three weeks,
permittee shall remove such markings without causing damage to the pavement. If
the permittee fails to remove such markings after notice and a reasonable time
for cure, the city may cause the markings to be removed and invoice the
permittee for the removal costs, which costs shall be promptly paid.
   B.   Joint use of trenches. In order to minimize degradation of streets,
traffic impacts and other interference with the use of public rights-of-way,
work shall be coordinated so that to the greatest extent possible, consistent

be installed over the opening. Plating shall be secured in place to not allow
plating to move and asphalt transitions on all four sides with the appropriate
signage and shall be maintained at all times. When plating is used and results
in more than a one-half-inch differential between the pavement surface and the
plate top, a cold patch wedge will be placed as a transition.
      2.   Open trenches, holes, etc., adjacent to the roadway, in or adjacent
to the public right-of-way will be protected against danger to pedestrians and
bicyclists by the appropriate measures.
      3.   Temporary patching (cold mix AC) will be placed as needed to ensure
the safety of the traveling public and monitored to ensure it does not degrade
over time.
      4.   Bump or hazard signs will be placed and maintained appropriately to

   E.   Records. The permittee shall keep accurate records of the location of
all of its facilities located in the public rights-of-way and shall furnish
them to the city upon request or at such periodic intervals as the city may
require. In order for the city to regulate users in the public rights-of-way,
upon completion of new or relocation construction of underground facilities in
the public rights-of-way, the permittee shall provide the city with the
location of the underground and above-ground facilities in a format compatible
with the current city mapping format.
   F.   Restoration. Whenever a permittee causes any opening or alteration to
be made for any purpose in any public right-of-way, the work shall be completed
within a reasonable time, and upon completion of such work, permittee shall,
without expense to the city, restore the property disturbed in a manner
consistent with city standards, or as required by its permit, license, or
franchise which may incorporate special standards when required for city
purposes. Landscaping, whether in the public rights-of-way or on private
property, which is damaged by permittee shall be restored to its condition as
it existed prior to the work. Permittee shall exercise special care when
working near established trees or shrubs. If established trees or shrubs die
within six months of completion of work by permittee, it is presumed that
permittee caused such damage if the work performed was in the location of the
roots of such tree or shrub. Permittee shall use the submitted pre-construction
photos to ensure properties are restored as existed prior to the work.
   G.   City's facilities. The installation, use and maintenance of permittee's
facilities within the public rights-of-way authorized herein shall be in such a
manner as not to interfere with placement, construction, use, and maintenance
of public rights-of-way, street lighting, water pipes, drains, sewers, traffic
signal systems, or other utility systems that have been, or may be, installed,
maintained, used or authorized by the city. At the city's request, permittee
shall relocate its facilities at permittee's expense (unless state law
expressly requires otherwise). Upon the city's request, by a time specified by
the city, if permittee fails to move its facilities, the city may do so and
bill permittee the costs of relocation, which costs permittee shall pay within
30 calendar days after permittee receives the invoice. Permittee shall
reimburse the city any additional cost, including but not limited to design and
construction costs, incurred by the city due to the delay in location or
relocation of permittee's facilities.
   H.   Interference. Permittee shall not install, maintain, or use any of its
facilities in such a manner as to damage or interfere with facilities located
within public rights-of-way that are owned by another entity.
   I.   Location and maintenance of above-ground facilities. The city shall
approve the location of aboveground facilities, such as boxes, cabinets and
similar equipment or appurtenances. The permit shall set forth the location of
such aboveground facilities. If the city determines that a proposed location
would impair traffic visibility or visibility of existing signage or would
substantially harm existing landscaping, or that similar conditions exist which
would justify a denial of a permit in that location, the permit shall be
denied. Aboveground facilities shall be maintained in good condition. All
graffiti on the permittee's above ground facilities will be covered over or
removed within one business day of receiving a notification from the city. If
the city finds any of permittee's above-ground facilities are not maintained in
good condition, permittee shall correct such condition within three three
business days of receiving notice from the city.
   J.   Undergrounding of new facilities. No new poles or wires shall be
erected in the city above the surface of the ground unless a permit is first
secured from the city, except that the following construction may be installed
without such a permit:
      1.   Temporary service facilities, including but not limited to
facilities to furnish emergency service during an outage, facilities to provide
service to construction sites, or other service of a temporary nature for a
limited period of time, such as to a fair, carnival, outdoor exhibit or other
temporary function;
      2.   Pad-mounted transformers or pull boxes, service terminals, pedestal-
type telephone terminals, telephone splice closures, or similar on-the-ground
facilities normally used with and as part of an underground electric
distribution, telephone, data, telegraph or television system, or on-the-ground
facilities attached to existing overhead facilities which are used for the
purpose of connecting an underground system with the existing facilities;
      3.   Transmission lines and distribution feeder lines, together with
related switch yards, substations and related equipment;
      4.   Service drops from existing overhead lines to new single-family
residential customers, except when underground service is required by the
city's subdivision ordinance.
   K.   Plans. All facilities shall be installed per plans prepared by a
registered professional engineer and approved by the city prior to any work
commencing.
      1.   Use of existing poles or conduit. A permittee may install facilities
on existing utility poles or in existing conduit where permission is granted by
owner of the utility pole or conduit and such permission is verified by the
city, except where those same poles are scheduled to be replaced with buried
facilities. The city may require permittee to prove that it has such permission
from the owner to use the owner's facilities.
      2.   The installation of new poles or longer poles in the public rights
of way for any new facilities will be based on a determination of need for
service by the utility with approval by the city.
      3.   If permittee installs facilities on existing poles as provided
herein, permittee shall bury its facilities if such poles are removed and not
replaced in kind for any reason.
      4.   If permittee uses existing conduit owned by someone other than
permittee, permittee shall be subject to the provisions of this section in the
use of such conduit in the public rights-of-way.
      5.   As used herein, a pole installed to replace a damaged pole or to
remedy a safety hazard and which is substantially the same size as the pole
being replaced shall not be considered to be a new pole.
   L.   Conflict with city projects.
      1.   Identification of conflict. If, during the design process of public
improvements, the city discovers a potential conflict with proposed
construction, permittee shall either:
         a.   Locate and, if necessary, expose its facilities in conflict; or
         b.   Use the one-call notification center (blue stake) to locate or
expose its facilities. Permittee shall reimburse the city for the cost
resulting from the use of such location service. The city shall make reasonable
efforts to design and construct projects pursuant to this section so as to
avoid relocation expense to permittee. Permittee shall furnish the location
information in a timely manner, but not more than ten calendar days from the
date of the city's request.
      2.   Priority right. The city reserves the prior and superior right to
lay, construct, erect, install, use, operate, repair, replace, remove,
relocate, re-grade, widen, realign, or maintain public rights-of-way, aerial,
surface, or subsurface improvements, including, but not limited to, traffic
control conduits, storm sewers, subways, tunnels, bridges, viaducts, or other
public construction within public rights-of-way.
      3.   Procedures. If, during the course of a project, the city determines
permittee's facilities are in conflict, the following shall apply:
         a.   Prior to the city notice to proceed to contractor: Permittee
shall, within a reasonable time not to exceed one month, shall remove or
relocate the conflicting facility. The time shall begin running upon receipt by
permittee of written notice of the conflict from the city. If the city and
permittee agree, the time to remove may be extended, based on requirements of
the city's project.
         b.   Subsequent to city notice to proceed to contractor: The city and
permittee shall immediately begin the coordination necessary to remove or
relocate the facility. Actual construction of such removal or relocation is to
begin no later than 72 hours, if practicable, after written notification from
the city to proceed.
   M.   Damage to city rights-of-way and facilities.
      1.   If the permittee damages or disturbs the surface or subsurface of
any public rights-of-way or adjoining public property, or the public
improvement located thereon, therein, or thereunder, the permittee shall
promptly, at its own expense, and in a manner acceptable to the city, restore
the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way or public property, or
repair or replace the public improvement thereon, therein, or thereunder, in as
good a condition as before such damage or disturbance. If such restoration,
repair or replacement of the surface, subsurface, or any structure located
thereon, therein, or thereunder is not completed within a reasonable time, or
such repair or replacement does not meet city standards, the city shall have
the right to perform the necessary restoration, repair, or replacement, either
through its own forces, or through a hired contractor, and the permittee shall
reimburse the city for its expense in so doing within 30 days after receipt of
the invoice therefore.
      2.   As used in this subsection:
         a.   A paved right-of-way is considered "new" when it is first
constructed, when it is reconstructed or when it is renovated.
         b.   A right-of-way is considered "reconstructed" when all lanes are
completely rebuilt by removing all the pavement and aggregate base course
material, re-compacting the sub-base and restoring the base material and then
completely re-paving for a distance approved by the City Engineer.
         c.   A right-of-way is considered "renovated" when there is a major
rehabilitation, including a mill and overlay or other similar improvement work
that physically modifies the surface of the right-of-way prior to applying a
new surface or other similar work as determined by the City Engineer.
         d.   The date of construction, reconstruction or renovation shall be
the date such work was accepted by the city.
      3.   An application to work in the public right-of-way which includes
excavation in a new paved right-of-way shall not be granted until at least five
years after completion and acceptance of the construction, reconstruction or
renovation of the paved right-of-way unless one of the following applies:
         a.   Emergency which endangers life or property.
         b.   Interruption of essential utility or communications service.
         c.   Work that is mandated by city, county, state or federal
legislation.
         d.   Service for buildings where no other feasible means of providing
service exists.
      4.   Pavement restoration.
         a.   If an excavation is permitted pursuant to subsections M.3.a
through M.3.d. above, the permittee shall restore the paved right-of-way by
mill and overlay/inlay, for a minimum of curbline to centerline impacted by the
excavation(s). All renovations shall comply with the city standards. The
permittee may elect to fully reconstruct the paved right-of-way in accordance
with specifications provided by the City Engineer.
         b.   For excavation commencing five years or later after the paved
right-of-way is new (as defined in subsection L.2.), the permittee may elect to
renovate such paved right-of-way by mill and overlay/inlay, for a minimum of
the curbline to centerline of area(s) impacted by the excavation(s) in
compliance with the city standards.
         c.   When any utility installed in the roadway consists of three or
more perpendicular trenches within 150 feet, the roadway must be overlaid from
the curb line to the centerline. If a trench extends beyond the centerline, a
full street overlay will be required.
         d.   When any utility is installed in the roadway and is at an oblique
angle to the right-of-way centerline, the roadway must be overlaid from the
centerline to the curb line for the entire length of the utility extension. If
the utility trenching encroaches on both sides of the centerline, a full street
overlay will be required. Pavement overlays shall be perpendicular to the
centerline beginning or ending a minimum of one-half the street pavement width
from the edge of the trench.
         e.   Pavement replacement thickness and type are to be per city
standards. Curb and gutter replacement shall be a minimum of one full section.
Sidewalk replacement shall be a minimum of one full panel. Tunneling under
existing sidewalk will not be allowed in the public right-of-way.
         f.   In all cases where a street overlay is required, both ends of the
overlay area must be cold-planed perpendicular to the roadway a minimum length
of 15 feet to provide a flush transition. For half-street or full-street
overlays cold planing (grinding) of the entire paving area is required
(centerline to gutter or gutter to gutter). When curb and gutter does not
exist, the new overlay surface may, at the engineer's discretion, be tapered to
meet the elevation of adjacent paved surfaces. All asphalt joints and tapered
transitions shall be sealed per City standards.
   N.   Relocation of facilities.
      1.   General. The city shall bear no cost to relocate its existing
facilities, irrespective of the function served, where the city facilities or
other facilities occupying the public rights-of-way under authority of a city
permit, license, or franchise must be relocated and the conflict between
permittee's potential facilities and existing facilities can only be resolved
expeditiously as determined by the city by moving the existing city or other
approved facilities.
      2.   Delay. If permittee fails to keep or provide accurate records to
city or if permittee's relocation effort delays construction of a public
project so as to cause the city to be liable for delay damages, permittee shall
reimburse the city for those damages attributable to the delay created by
permittee.
      3.   City costs. Except as otherwise provided in a license, franchise, or
permit, or by other provision of law, the entire cost of relocation shall be
borne by the city if permittee is required by the city to relocate facilities
which are located in private easements obtained by permittee prior to
dedicating the public rights-of-way from which facilities must be relocated.
These prior rights of permittee would also be unaffected by any subsequent
relocation. "Prior rights" as used in this subsection means private easements
or other legally sufficient rights obtained by permittee prior to dedication of
the public rights-of-way from which the facilities are requested by the city to
be relocated.
   O.   Rights reserved to city. Without limiting the rights that the city may
otherwise have, the city hereby expressly reserves the following rights, powers
and authorities:
      1.   To exercise its governmental powers now or hereafter to the full
extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the city.
      2.   To determine any question of fact relating to the meaning, terms,
obligations, or other aspects of this section and the instruments issued under
this section.
      3.   To grant multiple, non-exclusive licenses, franchises, or permits
within the city to other persons.
   P.   City police power; continuing jurisdiction.
      1.   Police power. Permittee shall at all times be subject to the lawful
exercise of the city's police power, including all ordinances, rules and
regulations which the city has adopted or may adopt, and all laws, rules,
regulations, order, and policies of the state and the United States Government.
In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this section and other
provisions of the city standards, the stricter requirement shall apply.
      2.   Continuing jurisdiction. The city shall have continuing jurisdiction
and supervision over all facilities located within or on public rights-of-way.
The daily administrative, supervisory, and enforcement responsibilities of the
provisions of this article and any license or franchise shall be delegated and
entrusted to the department to interpret, administer, and enforce the
provisions of this article, and to promulgate standards regarding the
construction, reconstruction, relocation, maintenance, dismantling,

§ 12.08.100 COMMERCIAL DOCK STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   A.   Documentation. That certain document entitled "Layout and Design
Guidelines for Small Craft Berthing Facilities," declared a public document by
City Council Resolution No. 91-705 is hereby referred to and adopted by
reference as if fully set out herein except that the specific provision of this
section shall govern.
   B.   Definitions. The following terms are defined for the purposes of this
resolution, unless otherwise from context:
      DECKING and DECK SURFACE.  Describes the type of material to be used for
the deck and general conditions of repair that shall be maintained.
      FLOTATION.  Material describes acceptable types of material to be used to
provide buoyancy for the dock.
      FREEBOARD. The distance from the top of the deck to the water line.
      OR EQUIVALENT. when used in the foregoing standards is intended to allow
for latitude in construction and maintenance; however, the equivalency of any
variation from these standards shall be fully demonstrated to the council prior
to actual construction.
      SIZE.  Refers to minimum dimensions for fingers and gangways.
      SLIP. A berth or docking area designed to accommodate one boat.
      STABILITY. The ability of a dock to remain stationary during use.
STABILITY has been divided into three types: roll stability (motion about the
centerline of a dock and finger), pitch stability (motion in the vertical
plane), and yaw stability (motion in the horizontal plane).
   C.   Stability—general. All docks shall be constructed to provide a firm,
stable footing for persons stepping onto the dock either from shore or from a
boat moored to the dock.
   D.   Roll stability. Fingers of u-shaped slips shall allow minimum roll or
rocking motion during use. All portions of all docks shall be so constructed
that a concentrated weight of 400 pounds placed anywhere on the deck surface
shall not over-stress dock members nor shall it cause the dock surface to tilt
more than 6 degrees from the horizontal.
   E.   Pitch stability. All portions of docks shall be constructed to minimize
pitching due to activity on the dock.
   F.   Yaw stability. All portions of docks shall be constructed to minimize
yaw due to activity on the dock, without appreciable lateral movement or over-
stressing the dock structure.
   G.   Overall lateral wind stability. The design of all docks and anchoring
systems shall be sufficient to withstand all lateral loads reasonably expected
to occur at the specific location. Minimum wind load calculated per the current

vertical) at elevation 445 feet. Handrails between 34 and 38 inches high shall
be provided for gangways. Handrails shall be designed to resist a force of 50
pounds per lineal foot applied at right angles to the top rail. Bridgewater
Channel or high density entrances to docks shall be secured by self-closing
gates and fences a minimum of 5 feet in height extending no less than 3 feet
horizontally beyond the point of entrance. Intermediate rails and openings in
fences and gates shall not allow a 4-inch sphere to pass through.
   I.   Flotation material. To provide long-term flotation capability and to
minimize potential pollution of Lake Havasu due to decomposition of materials,
the following types of encapsulated flotation materials, or equivalents, shall
be used on all docks:
      1.   Tanks. Welded steel, fiberglass or polyethylene tanks filled with a
closed cell, expansion-type foam which completely fills the tank. Steel tanks
shall be coated with a corrosion-inhibiting coating which shall be resistant to
gasoline and hydrocarbons (a urethane coating or equivalent); or
      2.   Foam billets. Foam billets shall have the vertical surfaces and
bottoms protected with a minimum of 125 mil plastic coating or three-fourths-
inch reinforced lightweight concrete. Such coatings shall extend a minimum of 2

City”.
(Prior Code, § 12-1-1) (Ord. 08-913, passed 3-11-2008)
§ 13.04.020 PURPOSE.
   A.   A.R.S. § 9-463.01 directs City Councils of municipalities throughout
the state to regulate the subdivision of all lands within their respective
cities so as to establish minimum requirements and standards for the
installation of subdivision streets, sewer and water utilities, and
improvements as a condition of final plat approval.
   B.   The city is committed to ensuring that its growth shall constitute
balanced development which reflects proper consideration of the range of
economic, environmental, fiscal, social, and other issues. The subdivision of
land impacts all of these issues.
   C.   These regulations accommodate growth by considering the need for
services generated by subdivisions along with public ability to provide and/or
private willingness to contribute to the costs of these services.
   D.   The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the orderly growth
and harmonious development of the city; to insure adequate traffic circulation
through coordinated street systems with relation to major thoroughfares,

zoning change is necessary or desirable;
      2.   Determine the adequacy of existing or proposed schools, parks and
other public spaces;
      3.   Inspect the site or otherwise determine its relationship to major
streets, utility systems and adjacent land uses, and to determine any unusual
problems such as topography, utilities, flooding and the like;
      4.   Determine the need for preparation and review of a development
master plan prior to subsequent consideration of a preliminary plat;
      5.   In consultation with engineering staff, advise the subdivider if a
development master plan is required and to what extent it is to be prepared by
the developer.

proceed with processing of the preliminary plat until the zoning change has
been filed for. In any event, any change in zoning required in relation to the
preliminary plat shall have been adopted by the Council prior to or in
conjunction with preliminary plat approval by the Director.
   B.   Sanitary sewerage and water supply. As a prerequisite of preliminary
plat review by the Department, the subdivider shall have informed the Public
Works Department of his or her tentative plans and learned the general
requirements for sewage disposal and water supply as applicable to his or her
development.

§ 13.16.010 GENERAL.
   A.   Every subdivision shall conform to the goals and objectives adopted and
contained in the Lake Havasu City general plan. The subdivision shall also
conform to the zoning code and other applicable codes and ordinances of Lake
Havasu City and the Arizona Revised Statutes, where applicable.
   B.   Where a tract of land to be subdivided contains all or any part of an
area for a park, school, flood-control facility or area shown on the general
plan or recommended by the city, the site shall be platted showing streets and
lots with the area delineated by a bold line and the purpose of the site
designated. An agreement shall be reached between the developer and the public
agency relative to date, method and cost of the acquisition within one year of
final plat approval. If an agreement cannot be reached between the developer
and the public agency relative to date, method and cost of the acquisition
within the 1 year period, then the Council shall make a determination relative
to the compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   C.   Land which is subject to periodic flooding, land which cannot be
properly drained, or other land which, in the opinion of the Flood Plain
Administrator, is unsuitable for subdivision use, shall not be subdivided;
except that the Director may approve subdivision of such land upon receipt of
evidence from the City Engineer that the construction of specific improvements
can be expected to render the land suitable; thereafter, construction upon the
land shall be prohibited until the specified improvements have been planned and
construction guaranteed.
   D.   Where the tract to be subdivided is located in whole or in part in
terrain having an average cross-slope exceeding 10%, design and development
may, at the discretion of the Department and the City Engineer, follow the
standards and requirements of §
13.16.080 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 12-3-1) (Ord. 24-1324, passed 2-27-2024; Ord. 08-913, passed 3-
11-2008)
§ 13.16.020 STREET LOCATION AND ARRANGEMENT.
   A.   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a street
designated in the adopted transportation plan, the streets shall be platted in
conformance therewith.
   B.   Whenever a tract to be subdivided is located within an area for which a
specific plan has been approved by the city, the street arrangement shall
conform substantially to the plan.
   C.   Certain proposed streets, as designated by the City Engineer, shall be
extended to the tract boundary to provide future connection with adjoining
unplatted lands.
   D.   Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by
through traffic.
   E.   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing proposed
parkway, the City Engineer may require marginal-access streets or double-
frontage with nonaccess easements along the parkway, or such other treatment as
may be justified for protection of residential properties from the nuisance and
hazard of high volume traffic, and to preserve the traffic function of the
arterial route.
   F.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains the right-of-way of a railroad, a
limited-access high-way, an irrigation canal, or abuts a commercial or
industrial land use, the City Engineer may recommend location of a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way at a distance
suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land. The distance shall be
determined with due regard for approach grades, drainage, bridges or future
grade separations.
   G.   Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography as to
produce desirable lots of maximum utility and streets of reasonable gradient,
and to facilitate adequate drainage.
   H.   Alleys shall be required in all multifamily residential, commercial and
industrial subdivisions, except that the City Engineer may recommend waiver of
this requirement in certain residential districts because of topography,
required lot size or in lieu of underground utilities. The City Engineer may
also recommend the waiver of the requirements in industrial subdivisions.
   I.   Half streets shall be discouraged except where necessary to provide
right-of-way required by the transportation plan to complete a street pattern
already begun or to ensure reasonable development of a number of adjoining
parcels. Where there exists a platted half street abutting the tract to be
subdivided and the half street furnishes the sole access to residential lots,
the remaining half shall be platted within the tract.
(Prior Code, § 12-3-2) (Ord. 24-1324, passed 2-27-2024; Ord. 08-913, passed 3-
11-2008)
§ 13.16.030 STREET DESIGN.
   A.   The minimum required right-of-way widths shall be as follows:
      1.   Major arterial streets and highways, as required by current city
standards.
      2.   Collector streets as indicated by current city standards.
      3.   Local streets, as indicated by current city standards. In addition:
         a.   Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular right-of-way 45
feet in radius with an improved traffic turning circle 40 feet in radius. The
city staff may approve an equally convenient form of space where extreme
conditions justify.
         b.   Dead-end streets will not be approved except in location
designated by the planning commission as necessary to future extension in
development of adjacent lands. In any case, a dead-end street serving more than
4 lots, shall provide by easement a temporary turning circle with a 40-foot
radius or other acceptable design to accomplish adequate access.
      4.   Frontage streets as indicated by current city standards.
      5.   Alleys:
         a. Sixteen feet if single-family residential on both sides;
         b. Thirty feet if abutting commercial, multiple-family residential or
industrial districts.
   B.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary corners shall be cut off 15 feet on each side to permit
safe vehicular movement. Dead-end alleys are prohibited.
   C.   The vertical alignment of streets shall be as follows:
      1.   Street grade maximums shall be:
         a. Arterial routes, as determined by the City Engineer.
         b. Collector, 7%.
         c. Local residential streets, 9%.
      2.   Concrete or asphalt streets with concrete gutters, 0.4% is
desirable.
   D.   Where rigid adherence to these standards causes unreasonable or
unwarranted hardship in design or cost without commensurate public benefit,
exceptions may be made by the city staff.
      1.   Vertical curves in streets shall be as follows:
         a.   Arterial routes, as determined by the city.
         b.   Collector and minor streets minimum length, 100 feet, except in
cases approved by the city.
   E.   The horizontal alignment of streets shall be as follows:
      1.   Arterial routes, as determined by the city.
      2.   When tangent centerlines deflect from each other more than 10
degrees and less than 90 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a
minimum centerline radius of 500 feet for collector streets or 100 feet for
local streets.
      3.   Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent section of
centerline not less than 100 feet long, unless the radius exceeds 600 feet on
collector streets or 200 feet on local streets, in which cases no tangent is
required.
      4.   Streets intersecting an arterial route shall do so at an angle which
shall not vary from 90 degrees by more than 4r degrees; intersections of local
streets shall not vary from 90 degrees by more than 15 degrees.
      5.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided except under special circumstances.
      6.   Minor streets intersecting a collector street or arterial route
shall have a tangent section of centerline at least 150 feet in length measured
from the right-of-way line of the major street. No such tangent is required
when the minor street curve has a centerline radius greater than 400 feet with
the corner located on the major street right-of-way line. Where topographic
conditions make necessary other treatment to secure the best overall design,
these standards may be relaxed by the city staff.
      7.   Street intersections with more than 4 legs and "Y" type
intersections where legs meet at acute angles shall be avoided.
      8.   At street intersections, property line corner shall be rounded by
circular arc, said arc having a minimum tangent length of 12 feet.
   F.   Private streets shall be constructed to conform to current city
standards.
(Prior Code, § 12-3-3) (Ord. 08-913, passed 3-11-2008)
§ 13.16.040 BLOCK DESIGN.
   A.   The following minimum standards are required to assure convenient

§ 14.01.10 RELATIONSHIP TO THIRD-PARTY PRIVATE AGREEMENTS.

provision of this Development Code. Interpretation of this Code includes
clarification of intention and procedure, and determination of unspecified land
uses and uncertainties pertaining to the Zoning Map.
   B.   Permitted uses.
      1.   Interpretation also includes determinations as to whether a use of
land is permitted by this Development Code. If a proposed use of land is not
specifically listed in Article II (Zoning Districts), the use shall only be
permitted if the Zoning Administrator makes the following determinations:
         a.   The characteristics of, and activities associated with, the
proposed use are equivalent to those of 1 or more of the uses listed in the
zoning district as allowable, and would not involve a higher level of activity
or population density than the uses listed in the district;
         b.   The proposed use would meet the purpose/intent of the zoning
district that is applied to the subject site; and
         c.   The proposed use would be consistent with the goals and policies
of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan.
      2.   If the Zoning Administrator determines that an unlisted use is
equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use shall be treated in the same
manner as the listed use in determining where it is allowed, what permits are

is not specified by distances on the Zoning Map, the location of the boundary
will be determined using the Zoning Map scale; and
      3.   If a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the
land that was formerly in the street or alley will be included within the
zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the centerline of
the vacated or abandoned street or alley.
   D.   Referral. Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that the meaning
or applicability of any Development Code requirement is subject to
interpretation, the Zoning Administrator may issue an official interpretation,
or may refer any issue of interpretation to the Board of Adjustment for its
determination.
   E.   Procedure. A request for an interpretation or determination of the
meaning or applicability of any of the requirements of this Development Code

§ 14.02.03 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   A.   R-A: Residential Agricultural.
      1.   Purpose. This district is intended to provide for semi-rural, low-
density, residential development and agricultural uses, in more isolated areas.
The 1 acre minimum lot size and 1 dwellings/acre maximum density standards
restrict urban development. Designs that retain the visual character and appeal
of the desert landscape are encouraged. To foster the dual purposes of this
district, principal land uses include single-family and 2-family dwellings as
well as agricultural and animal related uses, plant nurseries and garden supply
stores, and community gardens, as provided in Table 3-1 (Permitted Use Table).
This district may serve as a transition between strictly residential and
strictly agricultural land uses.

§ 14.02.06 OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS.
   A.   Purpose and applicability.
      1.   This section regulates development and redevelopment in those
overlay zoning districts established by §
14.02.01, and having the boundaries shown on the Official Zoning Map.
      2.   An overlay district is distinguished from a base zoning district by
an “O” as the last letter in the zone district designation.
      3.   The provisions of each overlay zoning district supplement or modify
the standards and requirements of the underlying base zoning district.
      4.   In case of a conflict between the provisions of the overlay zone
district and an underlying base zoning district, the provisions of the overlay
zoning district shall apply, regardless of whether they are more or less
restrictive than the provisions of the base zoning district.
      5.   If a property is included in 2 or more overlay districts, and the
provisions of 1 or more overlay districts conflict, the more restrictive
overlay district provision shall apply.
   B.   AP-O: Airport Overlay.
      1.   Airport zones. This district establishes certain zones that include
all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces,
horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply to Lake Havasu City
Municipal Airport. These zones are shown on the Lake Havasu City Municipal
Airport Approach Plan and Zoning Map consisting of 1 sheet, prepared as part of
the Lake Havasu City Municipal Airport Master Plan, dated January, 1986, which
is hereby incorporated into this section by reference as though it were fully
set forth here. An area located in more than 1 of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
The various zones are established and defined as follows:
         a.   Utility runway visual approach zone.  The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
         b.   Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach zone. The inner
edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
         c.   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than
3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of this approach
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The
approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
         d.   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/
4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone-precision runway. The inner-edge
of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface.
Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
         e.   Precision instrument runway approach zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at
a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline
is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
         f.   Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces.
         g.   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runway designated utility or visual and 10,000
feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each
runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.
The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
         h.   Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
      2.   Airport zone height limitations.
         a.   Established. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no
structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed
to grow in any zone created by this section, to a height in excess of the
applicable height established in this section for the zone. Height limitations
are established for each of the zones in question as follows:
            i.   Utility runway visual approach zone. Slopes 20 feet outward
for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
            ii.   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater
than 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone. Slopes 34 feet outward for
each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
            iii.   Runway larger than utility with visibility minimum greater
than 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone-precision runway. Slopes 34
feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
            iv.   Precision instrument runway approach zone. Slopes 50 feet
outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet
along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally
for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet
along the extended runway centerline.
            v.   Transitional zones. Slopes 7 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits
sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the sides of and the
same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect
the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone
projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping
seven feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the sides of and the same
elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000
feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
            vi.   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation or at a height of 933 feet above mean sea level.
            viii.   Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward,
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the
airport elevation and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation.
      3.   Use restriction. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
section, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by
this section in a manner so as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals, or radio communication between the airport and aircraft,
make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others,
result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in
the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise endanger
or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport.
      4.   Nonconforming uses.
         a.   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this
section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of October 26, 1988, the effective date of this Airport Overlay District, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing
contained in this section shall require any change in the construction,
alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of
which was begun prior to October 26, 1988, and is diligently constructed.
         b.    Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the provisions of division
B.4.a., the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is required
to install, operate, and maintain thereon appropriate markers and lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the Public Works Director to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of the
airport obstruction.
   C.   NK-O: North Kiowa Overlay.
      1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate commercial
development along North Kiowa Boulevard between Catalina Drive and Havasupai
Boulevard in order to protect the public interest in achieving distinctive and
internally consistent architectural and site design elements. The North Kiowa
corridor presents special development opportunities and constraints related to
its association with the Central Business Park and its relationship with the
surrounding residential development. The guidelines and standards in this
section are designed to achieve a unified design treatment, to increase the
buildable area, to allow for designated outdoor display or storage, and to
provide a uniform street landscaping theme.
      2.   General development plan required. Rezoning of property to the North
Kiowa Overlay District shall include the adoption of a general development plan
conforming to the standards and guidelines in this section and applicable
standards of the underlying base zoning district and shall serve as a guide to
further development within the overlay district.
      3.   Design standards.
         a.   General requirements. Site and building design shall comply with
the applicable provisions of §
14.04.07, unless otherwise noted within this section.

be within the 10-foot buffer area inside of the property line.
         d.   Screening of outdoor uses.
            i.   Outdoor storage and display areas shall be designated with a
perimeter masonry screen wall using materials and textures similar to those
used on the primary façade of the primary structure.
            ii.   The perimeter screen wall shall be 6 feet in height and be
completely sight obscuring where the outdoor use abuts single- or multi-family
residential zoning districts.
            iii.   Materials may be stored to a maximum height of 6 feet.
            iv.   Fencing materials (e.g., chain link or wrought iron) may not
be used, except for gates and loading areas. Where permitted, fencing materials
shall include plastic lath or netting to obscure views into outdoor use areas
and be of a similar color to adjacent screen walls.
      4.   Additional permitted uses. In addition to the uses allowed by the
underlying C-1 Zoning District, the following uses are allowed if is sited in
compliance with the design standards in this division C.
         a.   Accessory warehouse uses conducted entirely within an enclosed
structure, but requiring some outdoor storage.
         b.   Accessory outdoor uses in compliance with the following
conditions:
            i.   The outdoor use shall be limited to storage materials or
supplies directly related to the business use and shall be accessory and
subordinate to the primary use on the property. The area of the outdoor use
shall not exceed the area of the primary structure. Stand-alone storage without
a primary structure shall not be allowed.
            ii.   The area designated for accessory outdoor storage uses shall
be located to the rear or side of the primary structure. No outdoor storage
shall be located within the area designated as parking-in-common.
            iii.   The accessory outdoor use shall be screened in compliance
with §
14.04.04.
      5.   Prohibited uses and materials. The following uses and materials
shall be prohibited:

general development plan and site plan and the following requirements:
         a.   Grading. Parking lot designs on the same block shall be aligned
to the greatest extent practicable. Grading activity shall not adversely affect
existing topography of the adjoining properties, and shall maintain the
existing slope or gradient of the entire block.
         b.   Paving. Paving shall match and be consistent with the
topographical elevations of any abutting paving on adjoining lots. Paving
design shall include 2 inches of asphaltic concrete over 6 inches of aggregate
base course.
         c.   Paint striping. Interim parking striping may be allowed until the
block becomes 60% developed or as determined by the Zoning Administrator to
implement striping and layout in compliance with the approved site plan.
         d.   Driveways. Temporary driveways may be allowed on an interim

and may not be installed in the open paving of the parking lot.
         e.   One area lighting fixture shall be installed for each lot in the
required landscape area as designated on the typical parking-in-common plan.
   D.   PD-O: Planned Development Overlay.
      1.   Purpose.
         a.   A Planned Development Overlay (PD-O) is a development in which
structures, land use, open space, transportation facilities, and utility
systems are integrated through an overall design concept on a single parcel or
aggregate parcels of land approved by City Council.
         b.   City review is accomplished by combining subdivision, conditional
use, and design review into a single process designed to provide a framework
for the development of a more desirable urban environment through application
of contemporary site planning techniques and architectural forms.
         c.   The Planned Development process is aimed at permitting creativity
and flexibility in site design that may not be achieved through a strict
adherence to zoning district and subdivision standards applicable to the base
zoning district.
         d.   The PD-O District is intended to encourage efficient use of land
and resources that can result in savings to the community, consumers, and
developers; preserve valuable landscape, terrain, and other environmental
amenities; and provide diverse and innovative living, working, or shopping
environments that consider community needs and activity patterns.
      2.   Applicability. In accordance with the requirements of this Code, the
PD-O Zoning District can be applied to any parcels.
      3.   Permitted uses. In a PD-O District, any land uses allowed in the
Permitted Use Table (Table 3-1) in §
14.03.01 may be permitted if they can be shown to provide an orderly relation
and function to other uses in the development and to existing land uses and is
consistent with the approved General Plan. The permitted uses of property
located in the PD-O shall be determined at the time the zoning overlay district
and development plan are approved, and development within the district shall be
limited to those uses specifically approved in those documents. Any addition of
uses, change of plans, or increase in size or density shall require a separate
application for amendment to the original approved PD-O and shall follow the
same process as any other zoning ordinance amendment, unless they qualify as a
minor change under §
14.05.03(N) (Changes to Approved Projects).
      4.   Guidelines for design. The following principles for proposing and
mixing land uses are recommended:
         a.   The proposed development shall be designed so as to produce an
environment of stable and desirable character not out of harmony with its
surrounding neighborhood.
         b.   Personal and individual privacy shall be maintained and balanced
with the provision of public and common areas.
         c.   Interest and variety within the development shall be sought by
means of street design and changes in and mixtures of building types, heights,
facades, setbacks, planting, or size of open space, and the design shall be
harmonious as a whole and not simply from street to street.
         d.   Natural amenities of the land shall be preserved through
maintenance of conservation areas and open spaces. A minimum of at least 20% of
the gross area of the site shall be retained in open space.
         e.   Building heights shall be consistent with the reasonable
enjoyment of neighboring property and the efficiency of existing public
services and facilities.
         f.   Within a primarily residential development, commercial and office
uses, if proposed, shall be scaled and integrated into the overall design.
Commercial and office uses within the development shall be along the street of
the development and be accessed by an arterial or collector road when possible.
         g.   Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the
development shall be permanently screened in a manner that sufficiently
protects the privacy and amenities of the adjacent, existing and proposed uses.
      5.   Dimensional standards.
         a.   This Code does not establish minimum lot sizes, minimum lot
widths, maximum lot coverage, minimum yards and building setbacks, or minimum/
maximum height requirements for properties in PD-O Zoning Districts.
Dimensional requirements shall be approved in the PD-O rezoning ordinance and
general development plan.
         b.   Maximum structure height may exceed those of the underlying base
zoning district to a maximum height of 60 feet, or 90 feet in the Channel
Riverwalk Zoning District, except that the Black Rock Preserve area is not
eligible for a height exception. Structures within 100 feet of the R-1, R-2, R-
E and R-A zones shall be limited to the maximum height allowed in the
underlying base zoning district.
      6.   Density. This Code does not establish minimum residential density or
non-residential development intensity in PD-O Zoning Districts. Maximum numbers
of dwelling units and/or building gross square footage shall be approved in the
PD-O rezoning ordinance and general development plan.
(Ord. 18-1203, passed 8-14-2018; Ord. 16-1141, passed 2-23-2016)
ARTICLE III: PERMITTED USES
§ 14.03.01 GENERAL–USING THE PERMITTED USE TABLE.
   Table 3-1 (Permitted Use Table) lists each land use available in the city
and indicates whether it is allowed by right, with a conditional use permit, as
an accessory or temporary use, or prohibited, in each base zoning district.
References to additional regulations (i.e., use-specific standards) applicable
to a certain land use are also included in the right hand column. Other
property uses or restrictions on uses may be contained in the city’s base or
overlay zoning district regulations in Article II (Zoning Districts). If a
property is located in a PD-O (Planned Development Overlay) district, the
permitted uses, conditional use, and any conditions on those uses are contained
in the rezoning ordinance and related documents for that property.
   A.   Permitted uses. A “P” in a cell of the Permitted Use Table indicates
that the land use is allowed by right in that zoning district, subject to
compliance with the use-specific standards referenced in the right hand column
for that use.
   B.   Conditional uses. A “C” in a cell of the Permitted Use Table indicates
that the land use is allowed in that zoning district only upon approval of a
conditional use permit as described in §
14.05.04G. and subject to compliance with any use-specific standards referenced
in the right hand column for that use.
   C.   Prohibited uses. A blank cell in the Permitted Use Table indicates that
the land use is prohibited in that zoning district.
   D.   Accessory uses. An “A” in a cell of the Permitted Use Table indicates
that the land use is allowed in that zoning district only if it is incidental
and subordinate to a permitted primary use of the land in that district (i.e.,
a P or C use that has been approved for the site).
   E.   Temporary uses. A “T” in a cell of the Permitted Use Table indicates
that the use is permitted in that zoning district for a temporary amount of
time and only after approval of a temporary use permit (§
14.05.04F.) and subject to compliance with any use-specific standards
referenced in the right hand column for that use.
   F.   Overlay district provisions govern. When a property is located within
the boundaries of 1 or more of the overlay districts listed in §
14.02.06, the provisions for that overlay district prevail over those in the
base zoning district. For example, if a use is prohibited in the base zoning
district where the property is located, but is a permitted use in an overlay
district applicable to the same property, then the use is allowed on that
property. On the other hand, if a use is listed as a permitted use in the base
zoning district but is listed as a conditional use in an overlay zoning
district applicable to the same property, then the use is a conditional use for
that property. Where a property is located in more than one overlay district,
then the most restrictive use provision in those overlay zoning districts shall
apply to the property.
   G.   Use-specific standards. When a land use is allowed in a zoning
district, there may be additional standards that apply to that specific use.
Those additional standards (use-specific standards) are cross-referenced in the
right hand column of the Permitted Use Table. These cross-referenced standards
appear in §
14.03.03 immediately following the Permitted Use Table.
   H.   Unlisted uses. When a proposed land use is not explicitly listed in the
Permitted Use Table, the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether or not it
is included in the definition of a listed use or is so consistent with the
size, scale, operating characteristics and external impacts of a listed use
that it should be treated as the same use. Any such interpretation shall be
made available to the public and shall be binding on future decisions of the
city until the Director makes a different interpretation or this Development
Code is amended to treat the use differently.
   I.   Licences and permits required. All uses required by the State of
Arizona or the federal government to have an approval, license, or permit to
operate, issued by the state or by another public, quasi-public, or regulatory
agency, are required by Lake Havasu City to obtain and maintain that state
approval, license, or permit at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a
violation of this Code.

protective barrier may have on surrounding land uses.
         a.   Location. A protective barrier shall only be located on lots

            iv.   Be similar in appearance, including materials and façade
articulation, with the color and design of surrounding structures, to the
greatest extent practicable.
         b.   On the Island, this use must be accessory to a permitted or
approved conditional use.
      8.   Public utility facilities, minor.
         a.   Underground requirement. Minor utilities that provide direct
service to a property shall be installed underground. The developer or owner
shall be responsible for complying with this requirement and making the
necessary arrangements with the utility companies for installation of necessary
facilities, unless the Commission or Council waives this requirement when
approving a development project.
         b.   Residential exemption. This requirement does not apply to
residential structures constructed within the A-P, R-A, R-E, R-1, R-2, or RMH
Zoning Districts.
         c.   Aboveground exceptions. For the purposes of this section,
appurtenances and associated equipment may be placed aboveground. These
appurtenances shall not be placed in required front or side yard setbacks and
shall be adequately screened to prevent visibility from the street.
      9.   Telecommunications facilities.
         a.   Purpose. It is the intent of these standards to regulate the
placement, construction, and modification of towers and telecommunications
facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public,
while not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
wireless communications marketplace in the city and to comply with federal and
state legislation regarding telecommunications facilities. This is done by:
            i.   Protecting residential areas and land uses from potential
adverse impact of the facilities and towers;
            ii.   Minimizing adverse visual impacts of towers through careful
design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
            iii.   Promoting and encouraging shared use/collocation of towers
and antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers;
            iv.   Promoting and encouraging the use of technology that either
eliminates or reduces the need for new tower structures;
            v.   Avoiding potential property damage from a tower by ensuring
that tower structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed,
modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or found to be
structurally unsound;
            vi.   Ensuring that towers are compatible with surrounding land
uses; and
            vii.   Complying with the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996,
and related regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as amended and interpreted by
the federal courts.
         b.   Permitting required.
            i.   Existing telecommunications facilities.
               (A)   Requests for collocation, removal, or replacement, or
eligible facilities requests, as defined in this Code and under federal law,
for a modification of an existing wireless telecommunications facility that
does not substantially change the physical dimension of the facility shall be
granted.
               (B)   An applicant shall file an eligible facilities request
with the Community Development Department demonstrating that the proposed
modification will not substantially change the physical dimensions of the
facility, as the term “substantial change” is defined in federal laws and
regulations.
               (C)   The Community Development Department shall determine
whether the application constitutes an eligible facilities request, and grant
the request within 60 days. Applications for collocations that do not qualify
as eligible facilities requests shall be granted within 90 days. These review
periods include the review for determining whether the application is complete.
This timeframe may be extended by mutual agreement or if the city informs the
applicant in timely manner that the application is incomplete.
            ii.   New telecommunications facilities. All new freestanding
telecommunication towers shall require the approval of a conditional use permit
by the Commission, except telecommunications facilities of 1 meter in diameter
or less, in any zoning district, and facilities of 2 meters in diameter or less
in commercial and industrial districts, which are permitted by right. The
application for a conditional use permit for a freestanding tower shall include
the following information:
               (A)   Technical documentation that a new telecommunications
facility is required to provide service and that the collocation of facilities
on an existing structure is not technically feasible.
               (B)   If the proposed facility will exceed the height limit of
the underlying zoning district, technical documentation must be provided
explaining the reason for the requested height, and that no other alternative
is technically feasible.
               (C)   To eliminate attempts to gain approval of
telecommunications facilities based on speculation, applicants for proposed
facilities shall provide affidavit of intended lease or use from a cellular
provider at the time an application is submitted.
               (D)   The Commission shall decide a conditional use permit
request for a new wireless telecommunications facility 150 days from the time
the application is received unless this time period has been mutually extended
or tolled because the applicant was informed, within 30 days of submitting the
application, that it is incomplete.
               (E)   Failure to demonstrate that the criteria in divisions
B.9.b.ii.(A) and B.9.b.ii.(B) above are true shall be considered grounds for
disapproval of a conditional use permit application.
         c.   Development standards.
            i.   General.
               (A)   Telecommunications facilities are subject to any
applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) standards.
               (B)   Telecommunications facilities shall meet the dimensional
criteria of the underlying zoning district unless varied by the terms of a
conditional use permit. For purposes of determining whether the installation of
an antenna or tower complies with zoning district standards (e.g., lot coverage
requirements, setback requirements, and other requirements) the dimensions of
the entire parcel shall control even though the antenna or tower may be located
on leased parcels within existing lots.
               (C)   Antennae and towers may be considered either primary or
accessory uses, but shall only be considered a primary use within residential
zoning districts on property of 2.5 acres or greater.
               (D)   An existing primary use or an existing communications
structure on the same parcel shall not preclude the installation of a new
communications structure on the same parcel.
               (E)   Antennae that are installed and towers that are
constructed in compliance with the provisions of this section shall not be
deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
            ii.   Setbacks. The proposed tower shall be set back at least the
height of the tower from any property line, except when located in the public
right-of-way or in a building architectural feature such as an enclosed tower,
steeple, or clock tower. The distance shall be measured from the center of the
tower’s base to the nearest property line.
            iii.   Fall zone. All applications shall include engineer-certified
fall zone calculations.

§ 14.04.02 PARKING AND LOADING.
   A.   Purpose and applicability. It is the intent of this section to provide
adequate parking and loading facilities to prevent street and traffic
congestion while allowing for efficient use of land. The standards of this
section shall apply to all development and redevelopment unless specifically
excepted or modified by another provision of this Code.
   B.   Exceptions and exemptions.
      1.   Change in permitted use or structure.
         a.   Whenever the use of a property is changed to a new type of
permitted or conditional use, parking and loading spaces required for the new
use shall be provided in compliance with this section.
         b.   Whenever a structure is enlarged resulting in a net increase of
gross floor area, seating capacity, dwelling units, or any other unit of
measurement used to determine the required number of parking spaces, parking
and loading spaces for the additional capacity shall be provided in compliance
with this section.
         c.   Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions B.1.a. and B.1.b.
above, a permitted use that does not meet the parking requirements of this
section may be converted to another permitted use without full compliance with
the required number of parking spaces provided:
            i.   The amount of parking available is at least 75% of the parking
required for the new use in
Table 4.02-1; and
            ii.   The applicant provides the maximum number of parking spaces
able to be accommodated on the site while complying with all other provisions
of this Code and without being required to remove or partially remove an
existing structure.
      2.   Small non-residential lots. No off-street parking shall be required
for any non-residential primary use on a lot in any mixed use district that is
smaller than 5,000 square feet where no portion of the front lot line is
located within 100 feet of a residential district.
      3.   Planned development.
         a.   The off-street parking requirements of this section shall serve
as the standard from which to request different parking requirements for a PD-
O (Planned Development Overlay) District.
         b.   Following approval of a PD-O District and general development
plan, the parking requirements in those documents shall apply instead of the
parking requirements in this section.
         c.   If an approved PD-O Zoning District general development plan or
site plan is silent on any aspect of parking addressed by this section, the
provisions of this section shall apply to that aspect of parking.
      4.   Parking-in-common.
         a.   Development and redevelopment of lots subject to a parking-in-
common agreement, on the effective date of this Code, shall comply with the
terms of that agreement instead of the parking requirements in this section. A
list of parking-in-common agreements known to the city, and the properties
included in those agreements, is available from the Department.
         b.   The off-street parking requirements of this section shall serve
as the standard from which to request different parking requirements for
parking-in-common areas existing on the effective date of this Code, or for the
creation of a new parking-in-common agreement after the effective date of this
Code.
         c.   Owners of properties subject to an existing parking-in-common
agreement may not physically separate or bar access to any part of the parking-
in-common area in a manner not permitted by the parking-in-common agreement
unless the owner first obtains modifies that agreement pursuant to §
14.05.04I.
   C.   Parking requirements.
      1.   Required parking spaces.
         a.   The minimum off-street parking requirements for the uses allowed
by this Code are listed in
Table 4.02-1.
         b.   When calculating parking spaces for any use, requirements for a
fraction of a parking space shall be rounded up to the next highest whole
number.
         c.   A reduction in the minimum off-street parking requirements may be
permitted in accordance with division O. below.
         d.   For any uses not listed in
Table 4.02-1, the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator based on parking requirements for
similar uses and any anticipated neighborhood and traffic congestion impacts.
      2.   Accessible parking. Within the requirements of
Table 4.02-1, accessible parking shall be provided for all multi-family and
non-residential uses as required by the City Building Code and the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).
      3.   Mixed uses. Where several uses occupy a single structure or parcel
of land, the total requirement for off-street parking and loading shall be
calculated based on division O.1.b. below.

   D.   Parking alternatives. In mixed-use and non-residential zoning
districts, the Zoning Administrator may approve applications containing
alternatives to the number of off-street parking spaces required by
Table 4.02-1, if the application meets the following standards.
      1.   Shared parking.
         a.   Location. Shared parking shall be located within 600 feet of the
primary entrance of all uses served.
         b.   Reduction. Where a shared parking area or facility meets the
location requirement of division D.1.a. above, the off-site parking required
for those uses may be reduced by the factors shown in
Table 4.02-2. Off-street parking required shall be the sum of the 2 parking
requirements for the 2 uses divided by the factors for that combination of
uses. If more than 2 uses share a parking lot or structure, the required
parking shall be calculated by applying
Table 4.02-2 to the 2 uses with the largest parking requirements and then
adding the required parking for the additional uses.

         c.   Other sharing permitted. As an alternative to the parking
reduction factors in
Table 4.02-2, the Zoning Administrator may allow the following reductions in
required parking:
            i.   Up to 50% of the parking spaces required for food, beverage,
and indoor entertainment uses located within 600 feet of a non-residential use
that is not normally open, used, or operated during the same hours; and
            ii.   Up to 100% of parking spaces required for religious assembly
uses located within 600 feet of a non-residential use that is not normally
open, used, or operated during the same hours.
         d.   Agreements. If the Zoning Administrator determines that there is
significant doubt that shared parking facilities will remain available for the
uses they serve, and the loss of those shared parking spaces would cause
significant neighborhood impacts or traffic congestion, the Zoning
Administrator may require a written agreement assuring the continued
availability of the shared parking spaces for the uses they serve. If required
by the Zoning Administrator, the agreement shall be on a form approved by the
city and shall be filed with the application for a building permit.
      2.   Bicycle facilities. Any parking lot or structure containing 10 or
more parking spaces shall provide adequate and safe on-site bicycle parking
facilities in accordance with the following standards:
         a.   For parking lots required to have more than 25 vehicle parking
spaces, the required number of vehicle parking spaces may be reduced by 1 space
for each required bicycle parking space installed, up to a maximum 20%
reduction of the number of required vehicle parking spaces.
         b.   Design.
            i.   Location. Bicycle parking facilities shall be:
               (A)   Located near the main customer and employee entrances to
the principal use;
               (B)   Clearly designated;
               (C)   Safely separated from vehicle maneuvering areas, and
               (D)   Located on the ground level when in a parking structure.
            ii.   Minimum dimensional standards. Each bicycle parking space
shall be at least:
               (A)   Six feet long;
               (B)   Two feet wide; and
               (C)   A minimum 5-foot wide access aisle is required beside or
between each row of bicycle racks.
            iii.   Materials. Bicycle parking facilities shall be surfaced with
all-weather material and maintained in a safe and neat condition that avoids
dust.
            iv.   Security. Bicycle parking facilities shall be equipped with
either a lockable enclosure (bicycle locker) or a permanent, secure, and
stationary structure (bicycle rack) that supports the bicycle frame and to
which the frame and both bicycle wheels can be locked.
      3.   Credit for motorcycle parking.
         a.   The Zoning Administrator may credit parking spaces for
motorcycles or other small motorized vehicles against required off-street
parking requirements in an amount of up to 5% of the standard vehicle spaces
required.
      4.   Credit for public parking. Some or all of the required off-street
parking spaces for a non-residential use may be waived by the Zoning
Administrator if publicly owned off-street parking is located within a 600 foot
walking distance from the main entrance of the proposed use, and the Zoning
Administrator also determines that adequate parking spaces are available within
the publicly owned parking area to accommodate the anticipated use.
      5.   Credit for on-street parking. The Zoning Administrator may credit
on-street parking spaces against required off-street parking requirements if
the on-street spaces are located within 600 feet of an entry of the building in
which the use is located, if the Zoning Administrator determines that those
parking spaces are frequently available for residents, patrons, or employees of
the proposed use and structure.
      6.   Additional parking reductions. The Zoning Administrator may allow an
additional reduction in the required number of parking spaces if the applicant
submits a parking demand study, prepared in accordance with the city’s
guidelines, by a qualified parking or traffic consultant, documenting the basis
for granting a reduced number of spaces, and the Zoning Administrator
determines the study accurately reflects the parking demand for the use or
structure.
   E.   Parking design standards. In mixed-use and special purpose districts,
parking area and facility designs shall comply with the following standards:
      1.   Parking layout dimensions.
         a.   Standard spaces. All required parking spaces must be a minimum of
9 feet in width by 18.5 feet in length and must comply with the minimum
dimensions for spaces and aisles shown in the following
Table 4.02-4 and
Figure 4.02-1.

   C.   General landscaping standards.
      1.   Landscape plan required. A landscaping plan meeting city
requirements shall be submitted as part of all applications for development or
redevelopment requiring a site plan/design review process under §
14.05.04H., unless the Zoning Administrator determines that landscaping
required under this section can be demonstrated without the use of a
landscaping plan. A landscaping plan may be combined with other required
application materials.
      2.   Minimum required landscaping. Landscaping shall be installed to
comply with the specific requirements for street trees, property edge
buffering, and parking area landscaping standards in this section to meet the
following minimum landscape requirements:
         a.   R-3, R-M, R-CHD, R-SGD, and R-UMS Zoning Districts. In multi-
family residential zoning districts, a minimum of 20% of the total lot area
shall be landscaped.
         b.   Mixed use zoning districts. In all mixed-use zoning districts, a
minimum of 15% of the total land area shall be landscaped.
         c.   Special purpose zoning districts. In all special purpose zoning
districts, a minimum of 10% of the total land area shall be landscaped.
         d.   Parking in common. Minimum landscape area requirements for
properties within approved PIC plans shall be met by complying with landscape
element of PIC plan.
      3.   Plant materials.
         a.   Plant materials shall be from the city’s approved water
conserving plant list, or as otherwise approved through the site plan/design
review process. All plant material shall be hardy to northwestern Arizona (USDA
hardiness Zone 10a), free of disease and insects, and conform to the American
Standard for Nursery Stock of the American Association of Nurserymen.
         b.   Except for plantings used for screening, no 1 species of tree or
shrub may make up more than 50% of the total amount of landscape plantings.
         c.   Invasive species, as identified by the Arizona Department of
Agriculture Plant Services Division and the Arizona Invasive Species Advisory
Council, are prohibited.
         d.   At least 50% of all landscaped areas containing trees and shrubs
shall be planted with ground cover, and remaining areas shall incorporate a
minimum 2-inch layer of inert ground cover.
         e.   The use of artificial plant material is prohibited, unless
approved by the Director based on considerations of similarity of appearance to
live vegetation, durability appropriate for its anticipated use, and public
safety.
      4.   Minimum plant sizes. When included as part of the required
landscaping, trees shall be a minimum 24-inch container size, and shrubs shall
be a minimum 5-gallon container size. The above dimensions apply to sizes at
time of planting.
      5.   Plant material spacing. Except for the provisions of division F.
below, plant materials shall not be placed closer than 4 feet from any fence
line or property line. Where tree planting requirements are based on linear
street frontage, areas occupied by driveways shall be included when calculating
the number of trees required to be planted, and any trees that would otherwise
be required in driveways shall be planted in other landscaped front yard areas
unless prohibited by minimum spacing requirements for that species.
      6.   Landscape features. Landscaped areas may include architectural
features that add visual interest and a public amenity to the site including
rock groupings, sculptures, public art, water features and benches.
      7.   City right-of-way. Property owners are encouraged to install
landscaping on portions of the public right-of-way located between the front
property line and the vehicle travel lanes not occupied by sidewalks, above-
ground utility structures, or curb and gutter structures. However, all planting
or removal of trees or vegetation in city rights-of-way is subject to approval
by the city.
      8.   Flexibility for redevelopment. Where the requirements of this
section are applied to a redevelopment or reconstruction project, rather than a
new development, the Zoning Administrator may authorize a reduction of minimum
off-street parking requirements established in §
14.04.02C. by up to 10%, if necessary, to accommodate street frontage
landscaping required by division D. below or parking area landscaping required
by division E. below.
      9.   Installation and performance bond. Landscaping shall be installed
prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy, unless a security equal to
100% of the anticipated cost of landscaping is filed with the city, assuring
installation within 6 months after occupancy. Security may consist of a
performance bond payable to the city, cash, certified check, or other assurance
of completion approved by the City Attorney. If the installation of the
landscaping is not completed within the 6 month period, the security may be
used by the city to complete the landscape installation.
   D.   Street frontage landscaping. The street frontage of a property subject
to this section shall meet the following landscaping requirements:
      1.   Required depth. Street yard landscaping strips within private yards
adjacent to city rights-of-way shall be at least 10 feet in width.
      2.   Street trees and shrubs. Street trees and shrubs shall be planted
along a property’s street frontage in accordance with the following:
         a.   One tree per 40 feet of linear street frontage, planted on
center, and in alignment with any similar street frontage landscaping on
adjacent lots, or if that is not possible or adjacent lots do not contain front
yard landscaping, then within 10 feet of the front property line.
         b.   One shrub per 25 feet of linear frontage.
         c.   No more than 50% of required trees shall be from 1 tree species.
         d.   Street trees may be clustered and placed at uneven intervals, to
increase visual appeal or to avoid utility or site obstructions, with approval
from the Zoning Administrator during the site plan/design review process.
   E.   Parking area landscaping.
      1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section to provide landscaping areas
internal to parking lots to break up large expanses of pavement, provide shaded
areas, delineate pedestrian walkways and vehicular drive aisles to improve
visitor safety, and improve the overall appearance of the site.
      2.   Minimum required area. Ten percent of the interior parking area
occupied by parking spaces and interior vehicle circulation aisles (but not
including access driveways between the public street and the edge of the
parking area) shall be landscaped. Landscaping required to meet the
requirements of division D. above, or division F. below shall not be used to
satisfy this requirement.
      3.   Location and design. Internal landscape areas shall be designed in
accordance with the following standards, as depicted in
Figures 4.04-2 to

§ 14.04.06 NEIGHBORHOOD PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   A.   Intent. This section is intended to preserve the residential
neighborhood character of established homes within multi-family districts and
adjacent to mixed use or special zoning districts.
   B.   Applicability.
      1.   These standards apply to:
         a.   All lots in the R-3 and R-M Districts that contain a principal
use other than a single- or 2-family dwelling; and
         b.   All lots located in any zoning district other than the R-A, R-E,
R-1, and R-2 Districts that share a side or rear lot line with a lot in the R-
A, R-E, R-1, and R-2 Districts containing a single- or 2-family dwelling.
      2.   If any of these standards conflict with the dimensional standards in
§
14.04.01, intended for neighborhood protection, the stricter standard shall
apply.
   C.   Building height. Buildings constructed after the effective date of this
Code with a height greater than 30 feet shall reduce the perceived height of
the building when viewed from adjacent lots by using at least 1 of the
following techniques.
      1.   “Stepping down” building height of any portion of the building
within 100 feet of the side and rear lot lines to a maximum of 30 feet, unless
the dimensional standards of §
14.04.01 require stepping down to a lower height.
      2.   Increasing the side yard and rear yard setbacks a minimum of 10 feet
beyond that otherwise required in the zone district where the property is
located.
   D.   Screening and buffering.
      1.   The standards of §
14.04.04F. apply.
      2.   When the standards of that section require the construction of a
wall or fence, the following applies:
         a.   If the applicant’s property is in the R-3 or R-M Districts, the
required landscaping shall be installed on the side of the fence or wall facing
towards the adjacent lot with a single- or 2- family dwelling; and
         b.   If the applicant’s property is in any other district except the
R-A, R-E, R-1, R-2, or RMH Districts, the required landscaping shall be
installed on the side of the fence or wall facing towards the R-A, R-E, R-1, R-
2, or RMH Districts.
   E.   Parking, loading, and circulation.
      1.   No parking area, drive-through lane, or vehicle circulation driveway
shall be located between a primary structure on a lot containing a use other
than a single- or 2-family use and any side property line abutting a lot
containing a single- or 2-family dwelling.
      2.   If the context of a site makes division E.1. above impractical, the
Zoning Administrator may approve a parking lot design that locates a parking
area, drive-through lane, vehicle circulation driveway, or a combination of
these 3 site planning elements, in the area described in division E.1. above,
provided all of those 3 site planning elements are located at least 6 feet from
an adjacent lot containing a single- or 2-family dwelling.

of the side or rear lot lines of lots subject to this section shall be 20 feet.
(Ord. 16-1141, passed 2-23-2016)
§ 14.04.07 SITE AND BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   A.   Intent. The intent of this section is to:
      1.   Allow full development of properties consistent with the dimensional
and other district specific standards established in Article II and §
14.04.01 while establishing basic requirements for building and site features
that will create stable residential neighborhoods, mixed use, commercial, and
industrial areas.
      2.   Enhance the public realm.
      3.   Reduce conflicts between existing and new structures.
      4.   Encourage effective development of street frontages and other public
elements that enable new projects to add value to existing communities.
      5.   Encourage creative and sustainable design responses to contemporary
opportunities.
      6.   Improve the overall design quality of the city through the use of
objective standards that can be administered by the Department without the need
for individualized design review of projects.
   B.   Site design.
      1.   Applicability. The standards of this division B. apply to all
development in the city. The standards of divisions B.3. and B.4. below apply
to all new development, redevelopment, and remodels, in any zoning district,
except single-family detached, single-family attached, 2-family, co-housing,
and live/work residential dwellings.
      2.   Grading and drainage.
         a.   Site grading and drainage system designs shall be in compliance
with the adopted city Stormwater Management Plan and approved by the city.
         b.   Exposed graded areas shall be restored with revegetation or inert
ground covers.
         c.   No lot may be altered to permit water from any source to flow
from that lot to an adjoining lot other than as nature intended unless it is
directed to an existing drainage easement.
      3.   Site utilities. On-site utilities that provide direct service to a
property shall be installed underground. The developer or owner shall be
responsible for complying with this requirement and making the necessary
arrangements with the utility companies for installation of necessary
facilities, unless the Commission or Council waives this requirement when
approving a development project. Appurtenances and associated equipment (not
including light or power poles) may be placed aboveground, provided they are
not be placed in required front or side yard setbacks and are adequately
screened to prevent visibility from the street.
      4.   Site layout. The overall layout of a proposed project site including
but not limited to building placement, parking lot and loading areas, driveway
access, and circulation patterns shall be designed to not adversely impact
existing or future development of surrounding properties and traffic patterns
on adjacent streets.
   C.   Building design.
      1.   Applicability.
         a.   The standards of this section apply to all new development in any
zone district except:
            i.   Structures in which the principal use is one of the following
use categories or subcategories as shown in Permitted Use Table 3-1.
               (A)   Single-family detached and attached residential;
               (B)   Two-family residential;
               (C)   Co-housing dwellings;
               (D)   Live/work dwellings;
               (E)   Open space, park or playground;
               (F)   Public utility facilities;
               (G)   Parking lot (primary use);
               (H)   Community gardens;
               (I)   Heavy commercial services located in the LI and I
Districts; and
               (J)   Industrial located in the LI and I Districts.
         b.   A change in the principal use of an existing structure that does
not alter the exterior of the structure, or only affects the signage on the
exterior of the structure.
         c.   In the case of a conflict between the design standards in this
section and design standards applicable to a particular project because of its
location in a zoning district listed in §§
14.02.03 through
14.02.05 with specific standards, an overlay district listed in §
14.02.06, or because of a use-specific standard in §
14.03.03, the provisions of the base or overlay zoning district or use-specific
standard shall govern.
      2.   Materials. Materials used in constructing and finishing a structure
shall be of high-quality materials, durable under desert climate conditions,
that display a similar level of quality and architectural interest as materials
used in the design of structures adjacent to the proposed structure. Materials
may not create shine or create glare that the Director determines will create a
risk to traffic safety. Corrugated metal siding is permitted on structures in
commercial zones, but at least 30% of any building façade facing a public
street, excluding alleys, shall include alternate materials such as adobe,
brick, or stone in the design.
      3.   Colors. The color of exterior building walls and roofs, retaining
walls, and accessory structures on a proposed site shall be similar to and
reflect (1) the predominant natural colors of the area or (2) the colors used
on the built environment adjacent to the proposed development.
      4.   Entries and accessibility.
         a.   Each principal building shall have 1 or more operating entry
doors facing and visible from an adjacent public street.
         b.   The location of the building entry shall be emphasized by the use
of different materials, wall articulation, or foundation plantings around the
entry.
         c.   Building entries and window openings shall be protected and
shaded using roof overhangs, building projections or recesses, or other similar
design elements.
         d.   All principal entrances of principal buildings shall have direct
access to a sidewalk, walkway, or pathway that leads to a public street. Each
of these pedestrian connections shall comply with §
14.04.03. If a sidewalk does not currently exist, and there is a sidewalk
system in place on either adjacent property with frontage on the same street,
sidewalks shall be installed to connect to the existing sidewalk system.
      5.   Wall plane length and articulation. When the primary use of the
building is not categorized as Industrial in Table 3-1, each façade greater
than 100 feet in length abutting a public street shall incorporate
architectural features such as wall plane projections, recesses, or other
building material treatments and textures that visually interrupt the wall
plane. No uninterrupted length of any façade shall exceed 100 hundred
horizontal feet.

§ 14.04.09 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   A.   Maintenance standards.
      1.   General. When the standards and procedures of this Code or by
conditions attached to any permit, development approval, or variance require
that any building or site feature be constructed or installed, the property
owner is responsible for maintaining those building or site features in good
repair, and for replacing them if they are damaged or destroyed or, in the case
of living materials, if they die after installation. In addition, property
owners shall be responsible for each of the additional maintenance,
replacement, and operating standards set forth in this section.
      2.   Landscape maintenance. Landscaping shall be maintained in an orderly
and healthy condition. This shall include regular pruning, mowing of turf,
weeding, removal of litter, fertilizing, replacement of plants when necessary,
and application of appropriate quantities of water to all landscaped areas.
Maintenance practices shall include performing routine irrigation system repair
and adjustments, scheduling irrigation, using moisture-sensing or rain shut-off
devices, conducting water audits, and prescribing the amount of water to be
applied per landscaped area.
      3.   Access and circulation maintenance. Required ingress, egress, and
circulation improvements shall be kept clean and in good repair.
      4.   Parking and loading area maintenance. Parking and loading areas
shall be kept clean and in good repair at all times. Breaks in paved surfaces
shall be repaired promptly, and broken or splintered wheel stops shall be
replaced so that their function will not be impaired. Painted parking space
boundaries, handicap designations, and directional symbols shall be maintained
so as to be easily distinguishable.
      5.   Trash facilities maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the
property owner to ensure that the immediate surroundings and the floor of
trash/recyclable material enclosures are kept clean and free of debris, that
the enclosure gates have operable latches, that the enclosure gates remain
closed, and that the container lids remain closed at all times except during
periods of actual use. Trash to be collected may be placed at the street right-
of-way line on the assigned collection day for a period not to exceed 12 hours.
      6.   Sign maintenance.
         a.   General. Signs shall be maintained by the owner or person in
possession of the property on which the sign is located in conformance with the
conditions of the sign permit.
         b.   Damaged signs. A damaged sign base shall be repaired within 60
days. If the Zoning Administrator determines that a damaged sign may pose a
hazard to public safety, it shall be repaired or removed immediately.
         c.   Pole covers and sign cabinets. Internally illuminated sign
cabinets or sign panels that have been damaged shall not be illuminated until

(Ord. 16-1141, passed 2-23-2016)
§ 14.05.03 STANDARD REGULATORY PROCEDURES.
   A.   General review criteria. When this Development Code does not state
additional criteria for a decision, the decision shall be based on whether the
application is consistent with the requirements of this Development Code.
   B.   Preapplication review.
      1.   A prospective applicant or agent may request a preapplication review
with the Department before completion of project design and the formal
submittal of a permit application.
      2.   A request by an applicant for preapplication review, accompanied by
preliminary project plans and designs and the required filing fee, shall be
reviewed by all affected city departments and other selected agencies.
      3.   The reviewing city staff members may inform the applicant of
requirements as they apply to the proposed development project, provide a
preliminary list of issues that will likely be of concern during formal
application review, suggest possible alternatives or modifications to the
project, and identify any technical studies that may be necessary for the
review process when a formal application is filed.
      4.   Neither the preapplication review nor information or pertinent
policies provided by the Department shall be construed as a Department
recommendation for approval or disapproval of the application/project.
   C.   Application preparation and filing. The preparation and filing of
applications for permits, approvals, and other matters pertaining to this
Development Code shall comply with the following requirements.
      1.   Application contents. Applications shall include the forms provided
by the Department, and all information and materials required by the
application content requirements handout provided by the Department for the
specific type of application. Unless an exception is stated in this Development
Code, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence in support
of any findings required by this Development Code.
      2.   Eligibility. Applications may be made by the owner of the subject
property, or by any agent or representative with the written consent of the
property owner.
      3.   Filing. All land use permits and other applications required by this
Development Code shall be filed with the Department.
      4.   Filing date. The filing date of an application shall be the date on
which the Department receives the application, including any supporting
documents required to be submitted with the application.
   D.   Application fees.
      1.   Filing fees required.
         a.   Each application for a permit, approval, entitlement, or other
matter related to this Development Code shall be accompanied by the applicable
fee.
         b.   The city’s processing fees are cumulative. For example, if an
application for a lot split also requires a variance, both fees shall be
charged.
         c.   Processing shall not commence on an application until all
required fees/deposits have been paid.
         d.   Without the application fee, or a deposit if appropriate, the
application shall not be deemed complete.
         e.   The city is not required to continue processing any application
unless additionally required fees/deposits (e.g., additionally required “real
cost” deposits) are paid in full.
         f.   Failure to pay the applicable fees/deposits is grounds for
rejection of the application. No permit application shall be processed without
first being accompanied by the required fee, unless the fee is reduced or
waived in compliance with division D.2. below.
      2.   Fee reductions or waivers. The City Manager may reduce or waive
certain fees required by the Council’s fee resolution for sufficient cause
being demonstrated by the applicant in compliance with §
2.20.070 of the City Code.
      3.   Refunds and withdrawals.
         a.   Recognizing that filing fees are utilized to cover city costs of
public hearings, mailing, posting, transcripts, and staff time involved in
processing applications, no refunds due to a disapproval are allowed.
         b.   In the case of a withdrawal, the Director may authorize a partial
refund based upon the pro-rated costs to-date and determination of the status
of the application at the time of withdrawal.
   E.   Concurrent permit processing. When a single application requires more
than 1 permit or approval under this Development Code, the Director may
determine that all of the applications shall be reviewed, and approved or
disapproved, by the highest level review authority assigned by §
14.05.02 to any of the required applications. For example, a project that
requires a Zoning Map amendment and a conditional use permit may be reviewed,
and approved or disapproved by the Council (after a recommendation from the
Commission), whereas a conditional use permit application by itself may be
reviewed and acted upon by the Commission.
   F.   Initial application review. All applications filed with the Department
in compliance with this Development Code shall be initially processed as
follows.
      1.   Completeness review. The Zoning Administrator shall review all
applications for completeness and accuracy before they are accepted as being
complete in compliance with divisions C. and D. above. This determination shall
be made within 30 days of the filing date of an application per §
14.05.03 .C.4. This determination shall be made within 15 calendar days of an
application resubmittal date addressing deficiencies the applicant was
previously notified of per §
14.05.03 .F.1.a.
         a.   Notification of applicant. The applicant shall be informed,
either that the application is complete and has been accepted for processing,
or that the application is incomplete and that additional information,
specified in a letter or electronic notice, must be provided. If the
application is not administratively complete, the letter or electronic notice
to the applicant shall include a comprehensive list of the specific
deficiencies. Upon issuance of this notice, both the completeness review and
the overall time frames are suspended from the date the notice is issued until
the missing information is received from the applicant. If more than one
department's approval is required to approve the application, additional letter
or electronic notices of administrative completeness or deficiencies may be
submitted by those departments to the applicant.
         b.   Appeal of determination. Where the Zoning Administrator has
determined that an application is incomplete, and the applicant believes that
the application is complete and/or that the information requested by the Zoning
Administrator is not required, the applicant may appeal the determination in
compliance with §
14.05.03O.
         c.   Expiration of application. If the applicant does not provide the
additional information required in compliance with division F.1.a., above,
within 120 days after the date of the letter requesting the additional

         a.   Unless conditions of approval or other provisions of this
Development Code establish a different time limit, any permit or approval
(except for Planned Development permits, which are subject to division L.1.b.
below, and Zoning Map Amendments) granted in compliance with this Development
Code that is not exercised within 12 months of its approval shall expire and
become void after action by the Council in compliance with state law (A.R.S. §
9-462.01), unless an extension of time is approved in compliance with division
L.2. below.
         b.   The permit or approval shall not be deemed “exercised” until the
permittee has at least obtained a building permit and substantial construction
in compliance with a building permit has taken place, or has actually commenced
the allowed use on the subject site in compliance with the conditions of
approval, as determined by the Director.
         c.   The permit or approval under this Development Code shall remain
valid after it has been exercised as long as a building permit is active for
the project, or a final building inspection or certificate of occupancy has
been granted. If the approval also involves a zoning map amendment, that
portion of the approval shall be returned to the Council with notice, in
compliance with state law (A.R.S. § 9-462.01E.).

time with the Department at least 30 days before the expiration of the permit,
together with the filing fee required by the Council’s fee resolution.
         b.   The burden of proof is on the permittee to establish with
substantial evidence that the permit should not expire. If the review authority
determines that the permittee has proceeded in good faith and has exercised due
diligence in complying with the conditions in a timely manner, the review
authority may grant a time extension for up to an additional 12 months from the
date of the decision to extend the permit or approval; provided, the review
authority first finds that there are adequate provisions for public services
and utilities (e.g., access, drainage, fire protection, sewers, water, and the
like), to ensure that the proposed extension would not endanger, jeopardize, or
otherwise constitute a hazard to the public health, safety, or general welfare,
or be injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and applicable
zoning district.
         c.   No more than 2 12-month time extensions shall be granted.
      3.   Hearing on expiration. At the request of the applicant, the review
authority may hold a hearing on any proposed expiration of a permit, in
compliance with divisions G. and H. above.
      4.   Terminated by discontinuance.
         a.   Permit shall lapse. A permit, approval, or entitlement under this
Development Code shall lapse (e.g., shall have the effect of terminating the
permit, approval, or entitlement and denying the privileges granted by the
original approval) if the use associated with the permit or entitlement is
terminated for a period of at least 180 days.
         b.   Recommencement. Recommencement of a use authorized by a permit,
approval, or entitlement after the 180-day period has expired shall require the
filing of a new application, together with the filing fee required by the
Council’s fee resolution.
   M.   Resubmittals.
      1.   Resubmittals prohibited within 180 days. For a period of 180 days
following the disapproval of a discretionary land use permit, approval,

application for the same or substantially similar discretionary permit,
approval, entitlement, or amendment for the same site shall be accepted for
filing.
      2.   Director’s determination. The Director shall determine whether the
new application is for a discretionary land use permit, approval, entitlement,
amendment, or other approval that is the same or substantially similar to the
previously disapproved permit, approval, entitlement, or amendment.
      3.   Appeal. The determination of the Director may be appealed to the
Commission, in compliance with §
14.05.03O.
   N.   Changes to an approved project. Development or a new land use
authorized through a permit, approval, or entitlement granted pursuant to this
Development Code shall be established only as approved by the review authority
and subject to any conditions of approval, except where changes to the project
are approved in compliance with this section.
      1.   Request for change. An applicant shall request desired changes in
writing, and shall also furnish supporting materials and an explanation of the
reasons for the request. Changes may be requested either before or after
construction or establishment and operation of the approved use; however, a
change in use shall be requested and approved before initiating the new use.
      2.   Minor changes. The Director may approve changes to an approved site
plan, architecture, or the nature of the approved use if the changes:
         a.   Are consistent with all applicable provisions of this Development
Code;
         b.   Do not involve a feature of the project that was specifically
addressed in the project approval;
         c.   Do not involve a feature of the project that led to conditions of
project approval;
         d.   Do not involve specific considerations by the applicable review
authority in the approval of the permit; and
         e.   Do not expand the approved floor area or any outdoor activity
area by 10% or more over the life of the project.

         b.   Appeal by Council. The Council may choose to review a decision

the Director. A member of the Council may request the opportunity to discuss
any decision previously rendered. A majority vote of the Council, taken before
the effective date of the review authority’s decision, is required to initiate
an appeal of the decision. Once the vote to initiate an appeal is passed by a
majority, the matter shall be scheduled for hearing by the City Clerk.
         c.   Referral to applicable review authority. The Council shall have

determination made by an administrative agency or official of the city that
conditions an approval for the use, improvement, or development of real
property on the requirement of an exaction or dedication. This section does not
apply to a dedication or exaction required in a legislative act of the Council
that does not give discretion to a city administrative agency or city official
to determine the nature or extent of the dedication or exaction.
         b.   Notice to property owners of rights to appeal. In each case in
which a city administrative agency or city official grants an approval for the
use, improvement, or development of real property subject to the requirement of
a dedication or exaction as a condition of granting the approval, the city
shall notify the property owner in writing that the property owner has the
right to appeal the dedication or exaction and shall additionally provide the

to a property owner for filing the appeal. After receipt of a written request
for an appeal, the Commission shall schedule a time and date for the hearing no
later than 30 days following the receipt of the appeal.
         e.   Hearing an appeal. At the time of the hearing on the appeal, the
city shall have the burden to establish that there is an essential nexus
between the dedication or exaction and a legitimate governmental interest and
that the proposed dedication or exaction is roughly proportional to the impact
of the proposed use, improvement, or development.
         f.   Decision. The Administrative Hearing Officer shall decide the
appeal within 5 working days after the hearing. If the city does not meet its
burden under division O.7.e., above, the Commission, sitting as the
Administrative Hearing Officer, shall modify or delete the requirement of the
dedication or exaction. If the Commission, sitting as the Administrative
Hearing Officer, modifies or affirms the requirement of the dedication or
exaction, a property owner aggrieved by that decision may, at any time within
30 days after that decision, file a complaint for a trial de novo in the
Superior Court.

procedures for an appellant. No person shall be allowed to join an appeal after
the end of the specified appeal period.
         e.   Action on appeals. The appeal body shall conduct a public hearing
in compliance with divisions G. and H. above.

form approved by the Director. The amount of security shall be as determined by
the Director to be necessary to ensure proper completion of the work and/or

to be sufficient to ensure the proper maintenance and functioning of the
improvements.
      3.   Duration of security. Required improvement security shall remain in
effect until final inspections have been made and all work has been approved by
the Director, or until any warranty period required by the Director has

and collect from the permittee or surety all the costs incurred by the city,
including the costs of the work, and all administrative and inspection costs.
         c.   Any unused portion of the security shall be refunded to the
funding source after deduction of the cost of the work by the city.

upon a change of ownership (e.g., of the site, structure, or use that was the
subject of the permit application), provided that the use and development
remains in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Development Code
and any conditions of approval.

structure(s) shall be filed at least 14 days before the intended use
inauguration;
         c.   In order to provide for an expeditious permit review/
reconstruction process, which may only be available following the occurrence of
a bona fide emergency (e.g., natural disaster, and the like), as determined by
the Council, an emergency building permit and temporary zoning clearance may be
issued by the appropriate city department; and
         d.   No person shall occupy, use, or alter any structure, or change
any use, or type or class of use, without first applying for and obtaining the
required zoning clearance.
      2.   Zoning Administrator’s action. The Zoning Administrator shall issue
the zoning clearance after determining that the proposed development/
improvement complies with all of the applicable standards and provisions for
the category of use or the zoning district of the subject lot, in full
compliance with the City Code and this Development Code.
      3.   Conflicting permits prohibited. All departments, officials, or
public employees vested with the authority or duty to issue permits where
required by law shall conform to the provisions of this Development Code. A
permit for uses, structures, or purposes in conflict with the provisions of
this Development Code shall not be issued. Any permit, issued in conflict with
the provisions of this Development Code, shall be deemed void.
   B.   Sign permits. A sign permit shall be required to erect, construct,
enlarge, move, alter, or reconstruct a sign except for signs that are exempt
from permits in compliance with §
14.04.08D.
   C.   Airport Overlay District permit.
      1.   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in divisions C.1.a.,
C.1.b., and C.1.c. below, no material change shall be made in the use of land,
no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any portion of the Airport Overlay District unless an Airport
Overlay District permit has been applied for and granted. Each application for
a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with
sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting
use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations in this division C. If
the Zoning Administrator determines that the application complies with the
regulations in this division C., the permit shall be granted. No permit for a
use inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be granted unless a
variance has been approved in compliance with division D. below.
         a.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
50 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain,
land contour, or topographic features (e.g., structure or tree) would extend
above the height limits prescribed for the zones.
         b.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 5,000 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 30 feet of
vertical height above the ground except when the tree or structure would extend
above the height limit prescribed for the approach zones.
         c.   In the area lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than 50 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when the tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or
topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the
transition zones. Nothing in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed
as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree, in excess of any of the height limits
established by this section, except as set forth in division D.4. below.
         d.   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of any obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than
it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section or any
amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
Except as indicated, all applications for these permits shall be granted.
         e.   Obstruction marking and lighting. Upon a recommendation by the
Federal Aviation Administration or the airport operator stating that lighting
is necessary to achieve the goals of the Airport Overlay District and is
reasonable under the circumstances, any permit or variance granted may be
conditioned to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to
install, operate and maintain, at the owners expense, markings and lights as
may be necessary. Such a condition may be appealed to the BOA pursuant to §
14.05.03O. and may be modified by the BOA to require the owner to permit the
city, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary
markings and lights.
   D.   Variances, minor and major.
      1.   Applicability. The provisions of this section allow for variances
from the development standards of this Development Code.
         a.   Eligibility. A variance may only be granted when, because of
special circumstances applicable to the property, including location, shape,
size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions, the strict application of
this Development Code denies the property privileges enjoyed by other property
in the vicinity and under the identical zoning district. These same special
circumstances must create an unnecessary hardship, which is not the result of
the actions of the applicant (or self-imposed by the property owner), or must
represent an unreasonable regulation that makes it obviously impractical to
require compliance with the development standards.
         b.   Special privileges prohibited. A variance shall not be granted
that would have the effect of granting a special privilege not shared by other
property owners in the vicinity and under identical zoning districts, or that
is contrary to the public convenience, health, interest, safety, or welfare.
         c.   Use variances prohibited. The power to grant variances does not
permit changes in allowable land uses, in compliance with state law (A.R.S. §
9-462.06H.1.). Flexibility in allowable land uses is provided in division G.
below.
      2.   Review authority.
         a.   The Zoning Administrator may grant a minor variance in compliance
with division D.3. below, or may defer action and refer the application to the
BOA for formal action.
         b.   The BOA may grant a major variance in compliance with division
D.4. below, or may serve as the review authority on a minor variance when
requested by the Zoning Administrator.
      3.   Allowable minor variances. An application for a minor variance shall
be considered by the Zoning Administrator only if it is of a type, and for an
adjustment within the maximum limits, shown in Table 5-2 below. A request that
exceeds the limitations identified in Table 5-2 shall require the filing of a
major variance application in compliance with division D.4. below.

                                                                                  ADJUSTMENT
1.   Area requirements. A decrease in the minimum area requirements. (Not      20%
including minimum lot area requirements - see number 4 below.)
2.   Detached accessory structures. A decrease in the minimum required rear    10%
setback for a detached accessory structure.
3.   Fence or walls. The construction of fences, gates, pilasters, or walls in 1-foot
the side and rear yards that exceed 6 feet in height.                             increase
4.   Lot area. A decrease in the minimum required lot area or size.            10%
5.   Lot coverage. An increase in the maximum allowable lot coverage.          10%
6.   Lot depth. A decrease in the minimum required lot depth.                  10%
7.   Lot dimensions. A decrease in the minimum required lot dimensions.        20%
8.   Lot width. A decrease in the minimum required lot width.                  10%
9.   Open space. A decrease in the minimum open space requirements.            10%
10.   Parking lot standards. A decrease in minimum parking lot and loading spac10%
dimensional standards (e.g., aisle, driveway, and space widths).
11.   Projections. An increase in the allowable projection of canopies, cornices,
eaves, fireplaces, landings, masonry chimneys, overhangs, raised porches,         10%
stairways, and steps into a required setback area, but no closer than 3 feet to
any property line.
12.   Setback areas. A decrease in the required front, side, and rear setbacks.10%
13.   Other standards. The Zoning Administrator shall also be allowed to vary
other standards including minor operational/performance standards relating to     10%
dust, glare, hours of operation, landscaping, light, noise, and the like
 
      4.   Major variances. The BOA may grant an adjustment from the
requirements of this Development Code governing only the following standards:
         a.   Any development standard identified in division D.3., above where
the requested adjustment exceeds the maximum limits for a minor variances;
         b.   Dimensional standards including distance-separation requirements,
fence and wall requirements, landscape and paving requirements, lighting,
loading spaces, lot area, lot dimensions, parking areas, open space, setbacks,
structure heights, and the like;
         c.   Number of off-street parking spaces, loading spaces, landscaping
and the like;
         d.   Maximum lot grading standards;
         e.   Sign regulations (other than prohibited signs); and
         f.   A variance to erect or increase the height of any structure, or
permit the growth of any tree, or use property in a manner not permitted by the
Airport Overlay District, provided the application complies with the following
provisions.
            i.   The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the
proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient
use of navigable airspace.
            ii.   These variances shall be allowed where the review authority
finds that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result
in unnecessary hardship and the relief granted will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justices, and will be in compliance with the spirit of this
section.
            iii.   No application for a variance to the requirements of the
Airport Overlay Zone may be considered unless a copy of the application has
been furnished to the Public Works Director for advice as to the aeronautical
effects of the variance. If the Public Works Director does not respond to the
application within 15 days after receipt, the BOA may act on its own to grant
or deny the application.
            iv.   The applicant shall notify the FAA prior to the construction
of a structure requiring a variance under this division D.4.
            Other standards including operational/performance standards
relating to dust, glare, hours of operation, landscaping, light, noise, number
of employees, and the like.
      5.   Notice and hearings.
         a.   Minor variances. Notwithstanding the provisions of §
14.05.03H., an application for a Zoning Administrator’s decision on a minor
variance shall be noticed by posting the subject site and notifying immediately
adjoining neighbors.
         b.   Major variances. A public hearing by the BOA, pursuant to §§
14.05.03G. and
14.05.03H. is required for all major variances.
      6.   Findings and decision.  
         a.   Following a public hearing, if required, the review authority may
approve a variance application, with or without conditions.
         b.   The applicable review authority shall record the decision in
writing with the findings on which the decision is based.
         c.   A variance application may be approved if it complies with the
following criteria:
            i.   Because of special circumstances applicable to the subject
property including, location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other
conditions the strict application of this Development Code deprives the
property of privileges enjoyed by other property of the same classification in
the same or an identical zoning district; or
            ii.   The special circumstances create an unnecessary hardship,
which is not the result of the actions of the applicant or self-imposed by the
property owner; and
            iii.   Granting the variance would not constitute a grant of
special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the
vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located; and
            iv.   Granting the variance would not be materially detrimental to
the public convenience, health, interest, safety, or welfare of the city, or
injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district
in which the subject property is located.
      7.   Compliance with findings. In approving a major or minor variance,
the review authority may impose conditions (e.g., buffers, landscaping and
maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements, parking, performance guarantees,
property maintenance, signs, surfacing, traffic circulation, and the like)
deemed reasonable and necessary to:
         a.   Ensure compliance with the general purpose of this section, and
the goals and policies of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan;
         b.   Ensure that the variance does not grant special privileges
inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and under
the identical zoning district in which the property is located;
         c.   Ensure that the approval would be in compliance with the findings
required by division G. above; and
         d.   Protect the best interests of the surrounding property or
neighborhood, and to preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      8.   Post approval procedures. The procedures relating to appeals,
changes, expiration, performance guarantees, and revocation in this Development
Code shall apply following the approval of a variance.
   E.   Grading permit for 1- and 2-family dwellings.
      1.   Permit and fees required. Grading or the placement of fill shall not
occur on any lot until a grading permit has been obtained from the Director and
the permit has been posted on the subject lot. This requirement is supplemental
to and in addition to any requirements of the adopted Building Code. Building
permits shall not be issued prior to the issuance of a grading permit.
      2.   Height of building site on upward sloping lots.
         a.   On upward sloping lots the building site may not be higher than
the average height of the lot excluding setbacks and easements. The average lot
grade shall be calculated by adding the grade elevations at the intersection of
the setback corners and dividing by the number of corners. The Director may
establish higher elevations of up to 2 feet above the average lot grade. No
import of fill material shall be allowed to achieve the desired grade height
and the exception shall not be for the purpose of building a structure in
excess of the maximum building height as allowed by the zoning district
standards. Approval of the 2-foot exception shall be requested prior to the
final grading inspection on the appropriate form available in the Community
Investment Department. A pad certification by a registered Arizona land
surveyor shall be submitted to the Building Department to verify the pad
height.
         b.   If a building pad elevation higher than that provided for above
is requested, the following criteria shall be used to determine the maximum
allowable grade. Additionally, a topographic plan, containing the following
information, prepared by an appropriately licensed Arizona registrant, shall be
submitted to the Director:
            i.   Topography;
            ii.   Proposed and existing grades at the lot corners, setback
corners, and proposed building pad corners;
            iii.   Proposed average lot floor elevations, building pad
dimensions, and pad square footage;
            iv.   Cut and fill quantities;
            v.   Driveway location and dimensions;
            vi.   Reference points of adjoining lots, and/or structures;
            vii.   Method of slope retention.
         c.   The following criteria shall be met or the increase in the grade
height shall not be approved:
            i.   The adjusted lot grade shall be determined by balancing the
on-site cut and fill so as to create a minimum allowable building pad of 7,000
square feet, or 5,000 square feet for lots of 12,000 square feet or less.
            ii.   No import of fill material shall be allowed or be necessary
for the creation of the minimum pad.
            iii.   On-site materials shall be used to grade driveway access to
the building pad.
            iv.   All retained and non-retained slopes shall conform to the
Grading and Excavations Chapter of the adopted Building Code.
         d.   If the applicant requests a building pad elevation in excess of
that allowed by the above criteria, a request for a variance from the
provisions of this section shall be submitted to the BOA pursuant to division
D. above.
         e.   A registered Arizona land surveyor shall certify the final grade
height.
      3.   Height of building site on downward sloping lots.
         a.   Lots with a major portion of the lot grade lying below the base
elevation may be filled to accommodate a building pad area no more than 1 foot
above the base elevation.
         b.   Fills shall be placed, watered, and compacted in layers not to
exceed 12-inch lifts, performed by a properly licensed testing laboratory or
Arizona registered professional engineer, certifying a minimum of 90% of the
maximum density as determined by the adopted Building Code standards or
equivalent. A minimum of 3 locations shall be inspected for compliance. All
grading operations shall be done in a dust free manner and shall comply with
local, state, and federal laws regarding dust reduction.
      4.   Excavation safety measures. Grading plans that include slopes that
exceed a 2:1 and depths that exceed 3 feet at any time during construction
activity shall include on the grading plan specific measures to ensure that the
excavations are protected from public encroachment. Measures shall be approved
by the Building Official and may include:
         a.   Physical barriers, including berms, temporary fencing, or other
suitable obstructions;
         b.   Warning lights, signs, or banners that will clearly indicate the
danger to trespassers of all ages; and
         c.   Where possible, stable trench coverings.
      5.   Conformance to adopted Building Code. All grading activities shall
be in compliance with the applicable provisions of the adopted Building Code
and this Development Code.
      6.   Watershed preservation. Planned or average lot grades shall preserve
the natural watershed.
      7.   Exploratory inspections. In the event of grading without a permit or
inspections, exploratory inspections shall be performed by an appropriate
Arizona registered professional to ensure code compliance. Substandard grading
shall be evaluated and a report prepared with recommendations for correction
shall be submitted to the Building Official for review and approval. Once
approved, corrective measures shall be performed under the direction of the
engineer.
   F.   Temporary use permits.
      1.   Permit required. Except for those exempt temporary uses listed in
division F.2.below, no temporary land use shall be established, operated, or
conducted unless a temporary use permit has first been approved in compliance
with this section. The following 2 categories of temporary uses identify the
level of permit required, if any, based on the proposed duration, size, and
type of use:
         a.   Limited day or weekend temporary uses not to exceed 3 consecutive
days identified in §
14.03.02.
         b.   Allowed temporary uses up to 30 days or as identified in §
14.03.02.
      2.   Exempt temporary uses. The following minor and limited duration
temporary uses are exempt from the requirement for a temporary use permit. The
Director shall have the authority to determine if a proposed use, not
identified within this division F.2., would also qualify for an exemption from
the requirement for a temporary use permit.
         a.   Car washes, limited to a maximum of 2 days each month for each
sponsoring organization, on non-residential properties. Sponsorship shall be
limited to educational, fraternal, religious, or service organizations directly
engaged in civic or charitable efforts, or to tax exempt organizations in
compliance with § 501(c) of the Federal Revenue and Taxation Code.
         b.   On-site contractors’ construction yards, in conjunction with an
approved construction project on the same site. The construction yard shall be
removed immediately upon completion of the construction project, or the
expiration of the companion building permit authorizing the construction
project, whichever first occurs.
         c.   Emergency public health and safety needs/land use activities, as
determined to be a true “emergency” by the Director.
         d.   Garage sales are exempt from the requirement for a temporary use
permit; provided, that sales occur no more often than 2 times per year per
residence, for a maximum of 3 consecutive days each.
         e.   A 1-time event that is limited to a single day and within the
hours of 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Only 1, 1-time event is allowed per person,
business, or group each calendar quarter.
      3.   Application filing, processing, and review.

shall be submitted for approval at least 2 days before the date that the
proposed use is scheduled to take place.
         d.   An application for a temporary use permit shall be submitted for
approval at least 15 days before the date that the proposed use is scheduled to
take place.
         e.   A public hearing shall not be required for a decision on a
temporary use permit.
      4.   Standards.
         a.   Standards for floor areas, heights, landscaping, parking,
setbacks, and other structure and property development standards that apply to
the category of use or the zoning district of the subject site shall be used as
a guide for determining the appropriate development standards for temporary
uses.
         b.   The Director may authorize an adjustment from the specific
standards deemed necessary or appropriate consistent with the temporary nature
of the use.
         c.   All materials and structures associated with the temporary use
shall be removed within 10 days after the actual termination of operations, or
after the expiration of the temporary use permit, whichever first occurs.
         d.   A minimum of 30 days shall pass between the issuance of a new
temporary use permit and (1) the expiration of a similar temporary use permit
for the same property, or (2) the actual removal of the materials and
structures associated with the former use, whichever last occurs.
         e.   Temporary uses may be subject to additional licenses,
inspections, or permits required by applicable local, state, or federal
requirements.
      5.    Findings and decision. A temporary use permit may be approved,
modified, conditioned, or disapproved by the Director. The Director may defer
action and refer the application to the Commission for review and decision at a
scheduled public hearing. The Director may approve or conditionally approve a
temporary use permit application, only after first finding that:
         a.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use would
not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the
health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood of the proposed use;
         b.   The use, as described and conditionally approved, would not be
detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to
the general welfare of the city;
         c.   Approved measures for the removal of the use and site restoration
have been required to ensure that no changes to the site would limit the range
of possible future land uses otherwise allowed by this Development Code;
         d.   Adequate provisions have been made for fire protection, traffic
access, parking, and circulation;
         e.   The use would meet all applicable county and state health and
sanitation requirements;
         f.   The time limit for the temporary use is the minimum necessary to
achieve the applicant’s intent; and
         g.   The temporary use would be compatible with the uses allowed in
the subject zoning district.
      6.   Conditions of approval. In approving a temporary use permit, the
Director may impose conditions (e.g., buffers, hours of operation, landscaping
and maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements, parking, performance
guarantees, property maintenance, signs, surfacing, time limits, traffic
circulation) deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the approval would
be in compliance with the findings required by division F.5. above, and to
preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      7.   Condition of site following temporary use. Each site occupied by a
temporary use shall be cleaned of debris, litter, or any other evidence of the
temporary use upon completion or removal of the use, and shall thereafter be
used in compliance with the provisions of this Development Code. The review
authority may require appropriate security before initiation of the use to
ensure proper cleanup after the use is finished.
      8.   Post approval procedures. The procedures relating to appeals,
changes, expiration, performance guarantees, and revocation in this Development
Code shall apply following the approval of a temporary use permit.
   G.   Conditional use permits, minor and major.
      1.   Applicability. A conditional use permit is required to authorize
proposed land uses and activities identified by §
14.03.02 as being allowable in the applicable zoning district subject to the
approval of a conditional use permit.
      2.   Review authority.
         a.   The Director may approve a minor conditional use permit for any
use listed in §
14.03.02 as requiring a conditional use permit where:
            i.   The proposed use involves less than 5,000 square feet of
indoor space; and
            ii.   The proposed use involves less than 1 acre of outdoor
activity space; and
            iii.   The Director determines that the proposed use will not have
significant traffic or parking impacts on surrounding properties.
         b.   If a proposed conditional use meets the criteria in division
G.2.a. above, but the Director determines that it includes unusual site or
performance features, the Director may defer action and refer the application
to the Commission for formal action.
         c.   The Commission may approve a major conditional use permit for any
use listed in § 14.03.02 as requiring a conditional use permit, and that does
not meet the criteria for action by the Director as a minor conditional use in
division G.2.a. above.
      3.   Application review, notice, and hearing.
         a.   Minor conditional use permit. The Director may approve a minor
conditional use permit without a hearing if the Director determines that it
meets the required findings in division G.4. below.
         b.   Major conditional use permit.
            i.   The Director shall review each major conditional use permit
application to ensure that the application is consistent with the purpose and
intent of this division G. The Director shall submit a staff report and
recommendation to the Commission for their consideration.
            ii.   The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on an
application for a conditional use permit, pursuant to §§
14.05.03G. and
14.05.03H. before the approval or disapproval of the permit.
      4.   Findings and decision. The review authority may approve or
disapprove an application for a minor or major conditional use permit and shall
record the decision and the findings upon which the decision is based. The
review authority may approve the permit only after first finding that:
         a.   The proposed use is allowed with a minor or major conditional use
permit, as appropriate to the request, within the applicable zoning district
and complies with all applicable provisions of this Development Code;
         b.   The proposed use is consistent with the goals and policies of the
General Plan and any applicable specific plan;
         c.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use would
not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the
health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood of the proposed use;
         d.   The use, as described and conditionally approved, would not be
detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to
the general welfare of the city;
         e.   The subject site is adequate in terms of size, shape, topography,
and circumstances and has sufficient access to streets and highways that are
adequate in width and pavement type to carry the quantity and quality of
traffic expected to be generated by the proposed use; and
         f.   The design, location, operating characteristics, and size of the
proposed use would be compatible with the existing and future land uses in the
vicinity, in terms of aesthetic values, character, scale, and view protection.
      5.   Conditions of approval. In approving a permit, the review authority
may impose conditions (e.g., buffers, hours of operation, landscaping and
maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements, parking, performance guarantees,
property maintenance, signs, surfacing, time limits, traffic circulation)
deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the approval would be in
compliance with the findings required by division G.4. above, and to preserve
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      6.   Post approval procedures. The procedures relating to appeals,
changes, expiration, performance guarantees, and revocation in this Development
Code shall apply following the approval of a temporary use permit.
   H.   Site/design review.
      1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide procedures for
the review and approval/ disapproval of site/design review applications in
order to guide the physical development of the city, consistent with good site
and architectural principles. Specific objectives include the following:
         a.   To implement the goals and policies of the adopted General Plan
related to site and development design;
         b.   To establish community design and aesthetics as planning
considerations in evaluating new development;
         c.   To develop and implement policy that will encourage
appropriateness and compatibility of new development with the existing natural
and manmade environment, existing community activity patterns, and community
identity; and
         d.   To develop and implement policy that will minimize or eliminate
adverse visual effects caused or perpetuated by the location and design of new
development, including effects from the following:

regulation of these legal nonconforming land uses, structures, and parcels. In
addition, §
14.02.06B. includes additional regulations that apply to nonconformities in the
Airport Overlay District.
   B.   Nonconforming structures.
      1.   Continuation. A nonconforming structure may be continued,
transferred, or sold; and may undergo normal and necessary maintenance and
repairs; provided that no structural alterations are made.
      2.   Loss of status through substantial damage.
         a.   If a nonconforming structure or a conforming structure used for a
nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed due to a catastrophic event and the
cost of repairing or replacing the structure is greater than 50% of the current
appraised value of the structure as shown on the County Assessor’s records, or
as established by a state licensed appraiser, the right to continue occupancy
of the nonconforming structure or to continue the nonconforming use shall
cease.
         b.   If the cost of repairing or replacing the structure does not
exceed 50% of the current appraised value of the structure, as shown in the
County Assessor’s records or established by a state licensed appraiser, the
structure may be restored and the use continued if the restoration is started
within 1 year of the date of damage or destruction and is completed within 2
years of the date of damage or destruction.
      3.   Exemption for residential units. Notwithstanding the provisions of
division B.2. above, nonconforming single-, 2- and multi-family residential
dwelling units damaged or destroyed due to a catastrophic event may be

current building and fire code requirements.
      4.   Special provision for MU-UMS and R-UMS Districts. A nonconforming
building or other structure may be allowed a tenant improvement or added to,
provided 50% or more of the existing floor area or 50% of the assessed value is
not exceeded.
      5.   Special provisions for Airport Overlay District. Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a nonconforming structure has been abandoned or
more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow the structure to exceed the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   C.   Nonconforming uses of land and structures.
      1.   Continuation. A nonconforming use of land and structures may be
continued, transferred, or sold; provided, the use shall not be enlarged or
intensified, nor be extended to occupy a greater area than it lawfully occupied
before becoming a nonconforming use.
      2.   Special provision for MU-UMS and R-UMS Districts.

         b.   A change of an existing permitted use to another permitted use
will not trigger compliance with UMS District standards.
      3.   Loss of status through discontinuance. If a nonconforming use of
land or a nonconforming use of a conforming structure is discontinued for a
period of at least 180 consecutive days or a total of 12 non-consecutive
months, rights to a legal nonconforming status shall terminate, regardless of
the owner’s intention to abandon.
   D.   Nonconforming home occupations.
      1.   Continuation. Nonconforming uses, legal under this Development Code,
shall continue as legal nonconforming uses under the current Code until one of
the events in division D.2. below occurs.

more than 30 days; or
         c.    The business is moved to a new location.

status cannot be regained and the use shall be subject to the applicable
regulations of this Development Code, and, as of July 1, 1997 and thereafter,
shall comply with the use-specific standards in §§
14.03.03E.2.h. and
14.03.03E.2.k.
   E.   Nonconforming site features.
      1.   Continuation. A nonconforming site feature, including but not
limited to parking, landscaping, or lighting, may be continued; and may undergo
normal and necessary maintenance and repairs; provided that the degree of
nonconformity is not increased.
      2.   Loss of status when status of use or building is lost. When a
nonconforming use or building loses its nonconforming status pursuant to
divisions B. or C. above, the nonconforming site feature also loses its
nonconforming status. Any requirement that the use or structure be brought into
compliance with the provisions of this development code shall require that the
nonconforming site features also be brought into conformance.
      3.   Special provision for MU-UMS and R-UMS Districts. A property with
nonconforming parking is allowed a change of an existing permitted use to
another permitted use and will not trigger compliance with MU-UMS and R-UMS
parking standards provided that the conditions of division B.1. above are met.

Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree has been more than 80% torn
down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that
would allow the tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate
from the zoning regulations.
   F.   Nonconforming parcels and lots. If a parcel or lot was legally created,
but no longer meets the minimum size, width, or other requirements of the zone
district in which it is located, the lot may still be improved with those
primary and accessory structures permitted in the zone district where it is
located, and may
be put to the primary and accessory uses permitted in the zone district where
it is located, provided that the structure and use comply with all requirements
applicable to other lots in that zone district, including but not limited to
minimum building setbacks, minimum parking requirements, and maximum lot
coverage by buildings.
   G.   Nonconforming signs.
      1.   Legal nonconforming status. A sign located within the city as of the

chapter shall relieve the owner or user of a legal nonconforming sign or owner
of the property on which the legal nonconforming sign is located from the
provisions of this chapter regarding safety, maintenance, and repair of signs;
provided, that any repainting, cleaning, or other normal maintenance or repair

property used in violation of this Development Code are responsible for any
prohibited act(s) or violation(s) on the subject property.

   D.   Administrative remedies.
      1.   Permit revocation or modification. This section provides procedures
for securing punitive revocation or modification of previously approved land

      3.   Review authority's action.
         a.   A land use permit, minor variance, major variance, or entitlement
may be revoked or modified by the review authority that originally approved the
permit, minor variance, major variance, or entitlement if any 1 of the
following findings of fact can be made in a positive manner:
            i.   Circumstances under which the permit was granted have been
changed by the applicant to a degree that 1 or more of the findings contained
in the original permit can no longer be made in a positive manner and the
public health, safety, and welfare require the revocation;
            ii.   The permit was issued, in whole or in part, on the basis of a
misrepresentation or omission of a material statement in the application, or in
the applicant's testimony presented during the public hearing for the permit;

division D.3.a. can be made in a positive manner, in order to modify or revoke
a minor or major variance, the reviewing authority must also make a finding
that the grantee has not substantially exercised the rights granted by the
minor or major variance.
   E.   Legal remedies. In addition to, or in lieu of, pursuing the
administrative remedies in division D above, a violation of this title may be
enforced as described in
