§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person found responsible for violating any provisions of this

civil code infraction, and upon such finding of responsibility therefor may be
punished by a civil sanction not to exceed the amount provided for under state
law. Each day that a violation continues shall be a separate offense punishable
as herein provided.
      (1)   In this section the term “violation of this code” does not include
the failure of a town officer or town employee to perform an official duty
unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as
provided in this section.
      (2)   In addition to any monetary civil sanction, the Civil Hearing
Officer shall order the defendant to abate the civil code infraction, unless it
has been abated by the date of a finding of responsibility therefor.
      (3)   The Civil Hearing Officer shall have the authority, within his or
her discretion, to suspend the payment of any civil sanction imposed.
      (4)   In any case involving a civil code infraction relating to the
occupancy or use of land, any monetary civil sanction imposed pursuant to this
section upon a defendant who holds an ownership interest in such land shall be
recordable as a lien upon the land and shall run with the land. The town, at
its sole option, may record a notice of civil sanction and abatement order with
the Mohave County Recorder and thereby cause compliance by any person(s) or
entity thereafter acquiring the property. When the property is brought into
compliance by the owner or responsible party, a satisfaction of notice of civil
sanction and abatement order shall be filed at the request and expense of the
owner or responsible party. It shall be the property owner’s responsibility to
secure the satisfaction of notice of civil sanction and abatement order from
the town.
   (B)   Any violation of or failure or refusal to do or perform any act
required by Title VII of this code constitutes a civil traffic offense which
shall result in a civil penalty not to exceed the amount provided for under
state law. In addition, the court shall levy penalty assessments pursuant to
A.R.S. §§ 12-116.01 and 12-116.02. Civil traffic violations are subject to the

accrual basis, gross income shall include all gross income for the applicable
period regardless of whether receipts are for cash, credit, conditional, or

Persons reporting on the accrual basis may deduct bad debts, provided that:
      (1)   the amount deducted for the bad debt must be deducted from gross
income of the month in which the actual charge-off was made, and only to the
extent that such amount was actually charged-off, and also only to the extent

a discount against the transaction, the discount may be excluded from gross
income as a cash discount. Amounts credited or refunded by a vendor for
redemption of coupons issued by any person other than the vendor may not be
excluded from gross income.
      (5)   Rebates issued by the vendor to a customer as a discount against
the transaction may be excluded from gross income as a cash discount. Rebates

The taxpayer must provide to his customer and also keep a reliable record of
the actual tax charged or collected, shown by cash register tapes, sales
tickets, or other accurate record, separating net transaction price and
combined tax. If at any time the Tax Collector cannot ascertain from the
records kept by the taxpayer the total or amounts billed or collected on
account of combined taxes, the claimed taxes collected may not be excluded from
gross income, unless such records are completed and/or clarified to the
satisfaction of the Tax Collector.
      (1)   Remittance of all tax charged and/or collected. When an added
charge is made to cover Town (or combined) Privilege and Use Taxes, the person
upon whom the tax is imposed shall pay the full amount of the Town taxes due,
whether collected by him or not, and in the event he collects more than the
amount due he shall remit the excess to the Tax Collector. In the event the Tax
Collector cannot ascertain from the records kept by the taxpayer the total or
amounts of taxes collected by him, and the Tax Collector is satisfied that the
taxpayer has collected taxes in an amount in excess of the tax assessed under
this Chapter, the Tax Collector may determine the amount collected and collect
the tax so determined in the manner provided in this Chapter.
      (2)   Itemization. A taxpayer, in order to be entitled to exclude from
his gross income any amounts paid to him by customers for combined taxes passed
on to the customer, must prove that he has provided his customer with a written
record of the transaction showing at a minimum the price before the tax, the
combined taxes, and the total cost. This shall be addition to the record
required to be kept under subsection (a) above.

When the person upon whom the tax is imposed shall establish by means of
invoices, sales tickets, or other reliable evidence, that no added charge was
made to cover combined taxes, the taxpayer may exclude tax collected from such
income by dividing such taxable gross income by 1.00 plus a decimal figure
representing the effective combined tax rate expressed as a fraction of 1.00.

Sec. 12-350. Recordkeeping requirements.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of every person subject to the tax imposed by
this Chapter to keep and preserve suitable records and such other books and

requirements established by the Arizona Department of Revenue for privilege tax
filings will be accepted. It shall be the duty of every person to keep and

specific other books, records, and documents. Such letter directive shall
apply:
      (1)   only for future reporting periods, and
      (2)   only by express determination of the Tax Collector that such
specific recordkeeping is necessary due to the inability of the Town to conduct
an adequate examination of the past activities of the taxpayer, which inability
resulted from inaccurate or inadequate books, records, or documentation
maintained by the taxpayer.
Sec. 12-360. Recordkeeping: claim of exclusion, exemption, deduction, or

tax had passed the burden of the payment of the tax to the person wrongfully
claiming the exemption. A person who wrongfully claimed such exemption shall be
treated as if he is delinquent in the payment of the tax and shall be subject
to interest and penalties upon such delinquency. However, if the tax is
collected from the vendor on such transaction it shall not again be collected
from the person claiming the exemption, or if collected from the person
claiming the exemption it shall not also be collected from the vendor.
Sec. 12-370. Inadequate or unsuitable records.
   In the event the records provided by the taxpayer are considered by the Tax
Collector to be inadequate or unsuitable to determine the amount of the tax for

   (1)   to provide such other records required by this Chapter or Regulation;
or
   (2)   to correct or to reconstruct his records, to the satisfaction of the
Tax Collector.

only unless it is favorable to taxpayers.

Collector.

accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
   (e)   The fact that the taxpayer has not maintained or provided such books
and records which the Tax Collector considers necessary to determine the tax
liability of any person does not preclude the Tax Collector from making any
assessment. In such cases, the Tax Collector is authorized to use estimates,
projections, or samplings, to determine the correct tax. The provisions of
Section

the City to the privilege tax account of the person who actually owes and
should have paid such taxes, provided that the City receives an assignment and
waiver signed by both the person who actually paid the tax and the person who

      (2)   provide that the person who erroneously paid the tax waives any
right such person may have to a refund of the taxes erroneously paid.
      (3)   authorize the City Treasurer to transfer the erroneously paid tax
to the privilege tax account of the person who should have paid the tax.
   (c)   When it is determined that taxes have been reported and paid to the
wrong Arizona city or town, such taxes shall be remitted to the correct city or
town, provided that the city or town to whom the taxes were erroneously paid
receives an assignment and waiver signed by both the person who actually paid
the tax and the person who should have paid the tax. Where the person who
actually paid the tax and the person who should have paid the tax are one and
the same, no assignment and waiver need be provided. The City shall neither pay
nor charge any interest or penalty on any overpayment or underpayment except
such interest and penalty actually paid by the taxpayer relating to such tax.
   (d)   This Section in no way limits or restricts the applicability of any
remedies which may otherwise be available under A.R.S. § 42-6003. The
limitations and procedures set forth in A.R.S. § 42-6003 shall apply to all
payments under this Section.

tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any requirement
of this Chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item of gross

estoppel to the institution of an action or counterclaim by the Town to recover
any amounts claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original assessment.

party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be allowed

Sec. 12-590. Civil actions.
   (a)   Liens.
      (1)   Any tax, penalty, or interest imposed under this Chapter which has
become final, as provided in this Chapter, shall become a lien when the Town
perfects a notice and claim of lien setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the
amount of the tax, penalty, and interest, the period or periods for which the
same is due, and the date of accrual thereof, the amount of the recording costs
by the county recorder in any county in which the taxpayer owns real property
and the documentation and lien processing fees imposed by the Town council and
further, stating that the Town claims a lien therefor.
      (2)   The notice of claim of lien shall be signed by the tax collector
under his official seal or the official seal of the Town, and, with respect to
real property, shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of any
county in which the taxpayer owns real property, and, with respect to personal
property shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. After the
notice and claim of lien is recorded or filed, the taxes, penalties, interest
and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above in the amounts
specified therein shall be a lien on all real property of the taxpayer located
in such county where recorded, and all tangible personal property of the
taxpayer within the State, superior to all other liens and assessments recorded
or filed subsequent to the recording or filing of the notice and claim of lien.
      (3)   Every tax and any increases, interest, penalties, and recording
costs and lien processing fees referred to above, shall become from the time
the same is due and payable a personal debt from the person liable to the Town,
but shall be payable to and recoverable by the Tax Collector and which may be
collected in the manner set forth in subsection (b) below.
      (4)   Any lien perfected pursuant to this Section shall, upon payment of
the taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs and lien processing fees
referred to above and lien release fees imposed by the county recorder in any
county in which the lien was recorded, thereby, be released by the Tax
Collector in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are released. The Tax
Collector may, at his sole discretion, release a lien in part, that is, against
only specified property, for partial payment of moneys due the Town.
   (b)   Actions to recover tax. The Arizona Department of Revenue, or any
agent or representative authorized by that Department, may bring action, in the
name of the Town, to recover taxes as provided in A.R.S. § 42-1114.
Sec. 12-595. Collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or cessation
of business.
   (a)   In addition to any remedy provided elsewhere in this Town Code that
may apply, the Tax Collector may apply the provisions of subsections (b)
through (d) below concerning the collection of taxes when there is succession
in and/or cessation of business.
   (b)   The taxes imposed by this Chapter are a lien on the property of any
person subject to this Chapter who sells his business or stock of goods, or
quits his business, if the person fails to make a final return and payment of
the tax within fifteen (15) days after selling or quitting his business.
   (c)   Any person who purchases, or who acquires by foreclosure, by sale
under trust deed or warranty deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by any other
method, improved real property or a portion of improved real property for which
the Privilege Tax imposed by this Chapter has not been paid shall be
responsible for payment of such tax as a speculative builder or owner builder,
as provided in Sections
12-416 and
12-417.
      (1)   Any person who is a creditor or an affiliate of creditor, who
acquires improved real property directly or indirectly from the creditor’s
debtor by any means set forth in this subsection, shall pay the tax based on
the amount received by the creditor or its affiliate in a subsequent sale of
such improved real property to a party unrelated to the creditor, regardless of
when such subsequent sale takes place. Such tax shall be due in the month
following the month in which the sale of the improved real property by the
creditor or its affiliate occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the real
property meets the definition of partially improved residential real property
in Section
12-416(a)(4) and all of the requirements of Section
12-416(b)(4) are met by the parties to the subsequent sale transaction, then
the tax shall not apply to the subsequent sale.
      (2)   In the event a creditor or its affiliates uses the acquired
improved real property for any business purpose, other than operating the
property in the manner in which it was operated, or was intended to be
operated, before the acquisition or in any other manner unrelated to selling
the property, the tax shall be due. The gross income upon which the tax shall
be determined pursuant to Sections
12-416 and
12-417 shall be the fair market value of the improved real property as of the
date of acquisition. The tax shall be due in the month following the month in
which such first business use occurs. When applicable, the credit bid shall be
deemed to be the fair market value of the property as of the date of
acquisition.
      (3)   Once the subsequent sale by the creditor or its affiliate has
occurred and the creditor or its affiliate has paid the tax due from it
pursuant to this subsection, neither the creditor nor its affiliate, nor any
future owner, shall be liable for any outstanding tax, penalties or interest
that may continue to be due from the debtor based on the transfer from the
debtor to the creditor or its affiliate.
      (4)   If the tax liability imposed by either Section
12-416 or Section
12-417 on the transfer of the improved real property to the creditor or its
affiliate, or any part thereof, is paid to the tax collector by the debtor
subsequent to payment of the tax by the creditor or its affiliate, the amount
so paid may constitute a credit, as equitably determined by the tax collector
in good faith, against the tax imposed on the creditor or its affiliate by
either paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this subsection.
      (5)   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, if a
creditor or its affiliate is subject to tax as described in paragraph 1 or
paragraph 2 of this subsection and such creditor or affiliate has not
previously been required to be licensed, such creditor or affiliate shall
become licensed no later than the date on which the tax is due.
   (d)   A person’s successors or assignees shall withhold from the purchase
money an amount sufficient to cover the taxes required to be paid, and interest
or penalties due and payable, until the former owner produces a receipt from
the Tax Collector showing that all Town tax has been paid or a certificate
stating that no amount is due as then shown by the records of the Tax
Collector. The Tax Collector shall respond to a request from the seller for a
certificate within fifteen (15) days by either providing the certificate or a
written notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued.
      (1)   If a subsequent audit shows a deficiency arising before the sale of
the business, the deficiency is an obligation of the seller and does not
constitute a liability against a buyer who has received a certificate from the
Tax Collector.
      (2)   If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to obtain a
certificate as provided by this Section, he is personally liable for payment of
the amount of taxes required to be paid by the former owner on account of the
business so purchased, with interest and penalties accrued by the former owner
or assignees.

REGULATIONS - PRIVILEGE AND EXCISE TAXES
Reg. 12-100.1. Brokers
   (a)   For the purposes of proper administration of this Chapter and to
prevent evasion of taxes imposed, brokers shall be wherever necessary treated
as taxpayers for all purposes, and shall file a return and remit the tax
imposed on the activity on behalf of the principal. No deduction shall be
allowed for any commissions or fees retained by such broker, except as provided
in Section
12-405, relating to advertising commissions.
   (b)   Brokers for vendors. A broker acting for a seller, lessor, or other
similar person deriving gross income in a category upon which this Chapter
imposes a tax shall be liable for such tax, even if his principal would not be
subject to the tax if he conducted such activity in his own behalf, by reason
of the activity being deemed a “casual” one. For example:
      (1)   An auctioneer or other sales agent of tangible personal property is
subject to the tax imposed upon retail sales, even if such sales would be
deemed “casual” if his principal had sold such items himself.
      (2)   A property manager is subject to the tax imposed upon rental,
leasing, or licensing of real property, even if such rental, leasing, or
licensing would be deemed “casual” if his principal managed such real property
himself.
   (c)   Brokers for vendees. A broker acting solely for a buyer, lessee,
tenant, or other similar person who is a party to a transaction which may be
subject to the tax, shall be liable for such tax and for filing a return in
connection with such tax only to the extent his principal is subject to the
tax.
   (d)   The liability of a broker does not relieve the principal of liability
except upon presentation to the Tax Collector of proof of payment of the tax,
and only to the extent of the correct payment. The broker shall be relieved of
the responsibility to file and pay taxes upon the filing and correct payment of
such taxes by the principal.
   (e)   (Reserved)
   (f)   Location of Business. Retail sales by brokers acting for another
person shall be deemed to have occurred at the regular business location of the
broker, in a manner similar to that used to determine “out-of-Town sales”;
provided, however, that an auctioneer is deemed to be engaged in business at
the site of each auction.
Reg. 12-100.2. Delivery, installation, or other direct customer services.
   (a)   “Delivery Charges” exist only when the total charges to the ultimate
customer or consumer include, as separately charged to the ultimate customer,
charges for delivery to the ultimate consumer, whether the place of delivery is
within or without the Town, and when the taxpayer’s books and records show the
separate delivery charges.
      (1)   Identification to the customer or consumer that the listed price
has “delivery included” or other similar expression is insufficient to show the
delivery as a separate charge. Only the separately stated charge for the
delivery shall be deemed a “delivery charge”.
      (2)   Freight in. Charges for delivery from place of production or the
manufacturer to the vendor either directly or through a chain of wholesalers or
jobbers or other middlemen are deemed “freight-in” and are not considered
delivery.
   (b)   “Installation”, as used in this definition, relates only to tangible
personal property. Installation to real property is deemed construction
contracting in this Chapter. Examples of installation relating to tangible
personal property are: installing a radio in an automobile; applying sun
screens on the windows of a boat; installing cabinets, carpeting, or “built-in
appliances” to a camper or motorized recreational vehicle.
   (c)   Repair of tangible personal property is not included in this
definition. See Regulation
12-465.1.
   (d)   “Direct Customer Services” means services other than repair rendered
directly to the customer. Services or labor provided by any person prior to the
transfer of tangible personal property to the customer or consumer are not
included in this definition. In the following examples, the requirements of
subsection (e) below are referred to by the words “identify” or
“identification.”
      (1)   A retailer sells a customer a $100 “plug-in” appliance, with a $25
delivery and installation charge. If the retailer identifies the $25 delivery
and installation charge, it is a charge for direct customer services.
      (2)   A caterer charges his customer $1,000 for the food and drink
served, $300 for setup and site cleanup, and $500 for bartender and waiters. If
all charges are properly identified, only the $300 for set up and cleanup is a
charge for direct customer services, and the $1,500 for food and service is
restauranting gross income.
      (3)   Persons engaged in engraving on wood, metal, stone, etc. or persons
engaged in retouching photographs or paintings may consider such charges for
labor as direct customer services.
      (4)   All charges by a photographer resulting in the sale of a photograph
(sitting charges, developing, making enlargements, retouching, etc.) for
services that occur prior to transfer of tangible personal property are not
direct customer services.
      (5)   An equipment rental company charging $25 for delivery may consider
such delivery charge as a charge for direct customer service only if such
charge is properly identified.
      (6)   Even if identified, charges for labor incurred in the production of
any manufactured article or of a custom-made article (jewelry, artwork,
tailoring, draperies, etc.) are not included in this definition, as such labor
occurs prior to the transfer of property.
   (e)   Recordkeeping requirements.
      (1)   Any person who engages in transactions involving these services
must:
         (A)   Separately bill, invoice, or charge the customer for such
services in a manner by which the customer or consumer may readily identify the
specific dollar amount of the service charge; and
         (B)   Maintain business books and records in a manner in which the
separate charge for such services can be clearly identified, to the
satisfaction of the Tax Collector.
      (2)   Rendering a statement to a customer for a transaction involving
such services and the transfer of tangible personal property which only
indicates the total amount of the charges with words such as “services
included” or “charge includes labor and parts” or similar a expression does not
satisfy the requirements of this subsection.
Reg. 12-100.3. Retailers.
   When in the opinion of the Tax Collector it is necessary for efficient
administration of this Chapter, he may regard any salesman, representative,
peddler, canvasser, or agent of any dealer, distributor, supervisor, or
employer under whom he operates or from whom he obtains tangible personal
property for sale, rental, lease, or license as a retailer for the purposes of
this Chapter, irrespective of whether he is making sales, rentals, leases, or
licenses on his own behalf or on behalf of others. The Tax Collector may also
regard such dealer, distributor, supervisor, or employer as a retailer for the
purposes of this Chapter.
Reg. 12-100.4. Out-of-Town/Out-of-State Sales: Sales to Native Americans.
   Sales to Native Americans or tribal councils by vendors located within the
Town shall be deemed sales within the Town, unless all of the following
conditions exist:
   (1)   the vendor has properly accounted for such sales, in a manner similar
to the recordkeeping requirements for out-of-Town sales; and,
   (2)   all of the following elements of the sale exist:
      (A)   solicitation and placement of the order occurs on the reservation;
and
      (B)   delivery is made to the reservation; and
      (C)   payment originates from the reservation.
Reg. 12-100.5. Remediation Contracting.
   The following activities are considered remediation contracting and are
exempt:
      (1)   excavation, transportation, treatment, and/or disposal of
contaminated soil for purposes of site remediation (rather than
characterization);
      (2)   installation of groundwater extraction and/or injection wells for
purposes of groundwater remediation;
      (3)   installation of pumps and piping into groundwater extraction wells
for remediation purposes;
      (4)   installation of vapor extraction wells for the purpose of soil or
groundwater remediation;
      (5)   construction of remediation systems, such as groundwater treatment
plants, vapor extraction systems, or air injection systems;
      (6)   connection of remediation systems to utilities;
      (7)   abandonment of groundwater or vapor extraction wells;
      (8)   removal/demolition of remediation systems;
      (9)   capping/closure construction activities; and
      (10)   service or handling charges for subcontracted remediation
contracting activities.

programs and allows the user to access the computer’s processing capabilities.
         (B)   “Applied Program (Software)”, which is the programming system or
technical language (including the tape, disk, cards, or other medium upon which
such language or program is recorded) designed either for application in a
specialized use, or upon which or by means of which a plan for the solution of
a particular problem is based. Typically, applied programs can be transferred
from one computer to another via storage media. Examples of applied programs
include: payroll processing, general ledger, sales data, spreadsheet, word
processing, and data management programs.
      (3)   “Storage Medium” is any hard disk, compact disk, floppy disk,
diskette, diskpack, magnetic tape, cards, or other medium used for storage of
information in a form readable by a computer, but not including the memory of
the computer itself.
      (4)   A “Terminal Arrangement” (also called “’on-line’ arrangement”) is
any agreement allowing access to a remote central processing unit through
telecommunications via hardware.
      (5)   A “Computer Services Agreement” (also called “data services
agreement”) is an agreement allowing access to a computer through a third-party
operator.
   (b)   For the purposes of this Chapter, transfer of title and possession of
the following are deemed sales of tangible personal property and any other
transfer of title, possession, or right to use for a consideration of the
following is deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal
property:
      (1)   Computer hardware or storage media. Rental, leasing, or licensing
for use of computer hardware or storage media includes the lessee’s use of such
hardware or storage media on the lessor’s premises.
      (2)   Computer software which is not custom computer programming. Such
prewritten (“canned”) programs may be transferred to a customer in the form of
punched cards, magnetic tape, or other storage medium, or by listing the
program instructions on coding sheets. Transfer is deemed to have occurred
whether title to the storage medium upon which the program is recorded, coded,
or punched passes to the customer or the program is recorded, coded, or punched
on storage medium furnished by the customer. Gross income from the transfer of
such prewritten programs includes:
         (A)   the entire amount charged to the customer for the sale, rental,
lease, or license for use of the storage medium or coding sheets on which or
into which the prewritten program has been recorded, coded, or punched.
         (B)   the entire amount charged for the temporary transfer or
possession of a prewritten program to be directly used or to be recorded,
coded, or punched by the customer on the customer’s premises.

entitles the customer to receive storage media on which prewritten program
improvements or error corrections have been recorded or to receive telephone or
on-site consultation services, provided that:
            (I)   if such maintenance contract is not optional with the
customer, then the charges for the maintenance contract, including the
consultation services, are deemed gross income from the transfer of the
prewritten program.
            (ii)   if such maintenance contract is optional with the customer
but the customer does not have the option to purchase the consultation services
separately from the storage media containing the improvements or error
corrections, then the charges for the maintenance contract, including the
consultation services, are deemed gross income from the transfer of the
prewritten program.
            (iii)   if such maintenance contract is optional with the customer
and the customer may purchase the consultation services separately from the
storage media containing the improvements or error corrections, then only the
charges for such improvements or error corrections are deemed gross income from
the transfer of a prewritten program and charges for consultation are deemed to
be charges for professional services.
   (c)   Producing the following by means of computer hardware is deemed to be
the activity of job printing for the purposes of this Chapter:

except as provided in subsection (e) below.
      (2)   additional copies of records, reports, manuals, tabulations, etc.
“Additional Copies” are any copies in excess to those produced simultaneously
with the production of the original and on the same printer, whether such
copies are prepared by running the same program, by using multiple printers, by
looping the program, by using different programs to produce the same output, or
by other means.
   (d)   Charges for the use of communications channel in conjunction with a
terminal arrangement or data services agreement are deemed gross income from
the activity of providing telecommunication services.

provided that charges for such services are separately stated and maintained as
provided by Regulation
12-100.2(e):

which is written or prepared for a single customer, including those services
represented by separately stated charges for the modification of existing
prewritten programs.
         (A)   Custom computer programming is deemed a professional service
regardless of the form in which the programming is transferred.
         (B)   Custom programming includes such programming performed in
connection with the sale, rental, lease, or license for use of computer
hardware, provided that the charges for such are separately stated from the
charges for the hardware.
         (C)   Custom computer programming includes a program prepared to the
special order of a customer who will use the program to produce copies of the
program for sale, rental, lease, or license. The subsequent sale, rental,
lease, or license of such a program is deemed the sale, rental, lease, or
license of a prewritten program.
      (2)   Training services related to computer hardware or software,
provided further that:
         (A)   the provider of such training services is deemed the ultimate
consumer of all tangible personal property used in training others or provided
to such trainees without separately itemized charge for the materials provided.

computer services agreement, original copies of statistical reports, graphs,
diagrams, microfilm, microfiche, photorecordings, or other information for the
same person who supplied the raw data used to create such reports.
   (f)   The purchase, rental, lease, or license for use of computer hardware,
storage media, or computer software which is not deemed custom programming is
deemed the use or storage of tangible personal property for the purpose of this
Chapter, and the amount which may be subject to Use Tax shall be determined in
the same manner as the determination of the gross income from the sale, rental,
lease, or license for use of such.
Reg. 12-120.1. Food for home consumption: recordkeeping and reporting
requirements.
   (a)   Reporting. Such persons who sell food for home consumption shall, in
conjunction with the return required pursuant to Section
12-520, report to the Tax Collector in a manner prescribed by the Tax Collector
all sales of food for home consumption exempted from taxes imposed by this
Chapter.
   (b)   Recordkeeping.
      (1)   Retailers shall maintain accurate, verifiable, and complete records
of all purchases and sales of tangible personal property in order to verify
exemptions from taxes imposed by this Chapter. A retailer may use any method of
reporting that properly reflects all purchases and sales of food for home
consumption, as well as all purchases and sales of items subject to taxes
imposed by this Chapter, provided that such records are maintained in
accordance with Article III, and regulations of the Tax Collector.
      (2)   Any person who fails to maintain records as provided herein shall
be deemed to have had no sales of food for home consumption, and if upon
request by the Tax Collector, a person cannot demonstrate to the Tax Collector
that such records and reports do properly reflect all sales of food for home
consumption, the Tax Collector may recompute the amount of tax to be paid as
provided in Sections
12-370 and
12-545(b).
Reg. 12-200.1. When deposits are includable in gross income.
   (a)   Refundable deposits shall be includable as gross income of the
taxpayer for the month in which the deposits are forfeited by the lessee.
   (b)   (Reserved)
Reg. 12-250.1. Excess tax collected.
   If a taxpayer collects taxes in excess of the combined tax rate from any
customer in any transaction, all such excess tax shall be paid to the taxing
jurisdictions in proportion to their effective rates. The right of the taxpayer
to charge his customer for his own liability for tax does not allow the
taxpayer to enrich himself at the cost of his customers. Tax paid on an
activity that is not subject to tax or that qualifies for an exemption,
deduction, exclusion or credit is not excess tax collected.
Reg. 12-270.1. Proprietary activities of municipalities are not considered
activities of a governmental entity.
   The following activities, when performed by a municipality, are considered
to be activities of a person engaged in business for the purposes of this

Reg. 12-350.1. Recordkeeping: income.

taxpayer.

both individual transaction amounts and totals for each reporting period for
each category of taxable, exempt, and excluded expenditures as defined by this
Chapter.

indicating separately the gross income from the sales of tangible personal
property from such out-of-Town branches or locations.
   (b)   Out-of-State Sales. Persons engaged in a business claiming out-of-
State sales shall maintain accounting records or books indicating for each out-

(Am. Ord. 2011-02, passed 9-12-2011)
Reg. 12-360.1. Proof of exemption: sale for resale; sale, rental, lease, or
license of rental equipment.
   A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for
rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to persuade
a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being acquired for
resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course of business. The
fact that the acquiring person possesses a Privilege License number, and makes
a verbal claim of “sale for resale or lease” or “lease for re-lease” does not
meet this burden and is insufficient to justify an exemption. The “reasonable
evidence” must be evidence which exists objectively, and not merely in the mind
of the vendor, that the property being acquired is normally sold, rented,
leased, or licensed by the acquiring person in the ordinary course of business.
Failure to obtain such reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will
be a basis for disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such
transactions.
Reg. 12-360.2. Proof of exemption: exemption certificate.
   For the purpose of proof of exemption, in transactions other than those in
which the proof is set by standard documentation as detailed in Regulations
12-350.1 and
12-360.1, the minimum acceptable proof and documentation for each transaction
shall be the completion, at the time of the transaction, in all material
respects, of a certificate containing all the information set forth below. For
the purpose of validating the vendor’s claim of exemption, such certificate is
sufficient if executed by any person with apparent authority to act for the
customer, and the information provided validates the claim.

entirely within the Town if all or a major portion of the dissemination

Reg. 12-407.1. (Reserved)
Reg. 12-415.1. Distinction between the categories of construction contracting.
   For the purposes of this Chapter, transactions involving improvements to, or
sales of, real property are designated into one of the following categories,
and these categorizations shall apply, whether or not a person designates
himself as a contractor, construction manager, developer, or otherwise:
   (a)   A person performing improvements to real property is one of the
following:
      (1)   an “Owner-Builder” when the work is performed by the owner or
lessor or lessee-in-possession. An “owner-builder” may also be a “speculative
builder”.
      (2)   a “Construction Contractor” when performing work for the owner or
lessor or lessee-in-possession of the real property, unless that person has
provided a written declaration stating that:
         (A)   the owner-builder is improving the property for sale; and
         (B)   the owner-builder is liable for the tax for such construction
contracting activity; and
         (C)   the owner-builder has provided the contractor his town Privilege
License number.
      (3)   a “Subcontractor” as provided in Section
12-415 (c).
   (b)   An owner or lessor (“owner-builder”) of improved real property is one
of the following:
      (1)   a “Speculative Builder” as provided in Section
12-100; or
      (2)   an “owner builder who is not a speculative builder” in all other
cases.
   (c)   The terms “owner”, “lessor”, and “lessee-in-possession” shall be
deemed to include any authorized agent for such person.
Reg. 12-415.2. Distinction between construction contracting and certain related
activities.
   (a)   Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with
construction contracting. Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving
equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting activity.
Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal property (with or
without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an operator shall be
deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property. For
example:
      (1)   Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving equipment
with operator is construction contracting. Rental of these items without an
operator is rental of tangible personal property.
      (2)   Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is rental of
tangible personal property.
      (3)   Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal property,
whether or not an operator is provided with the equipment rented.
   (b)   Distinction between construction contracting, retail, and certain
direct customer service activities.
      (1)   When an item is attached or installed on real property, it is a
construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or
replacement of that item is construction contracting.
      (2)   Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are
retail sales.
      (3)   Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached or
installed are considered direct customer service activities (for example:
carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, landscaping maintenance).
      (4)   Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are considered
construction contracting.
   (c)   Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real property
is considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. Examples of
consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air conditioning coolant,
but not paint.
   (d)   Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has
independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.
      (1)   “Tangible personal property which has independent functional
utility” must be able to substantially perform its function(s) without
attachment to real property. “Attachment to real property” must include more
than connection to water, power, gas, communication, or other service.
      (2)   Examples of tangible personal property which has independent
functional utility include artwork, furnishings, “plug-in” kitchen equipment,
or similar items installed by bolts or similar fastenings.
      (3)   Examples of tangible personal property which does not have
independent functional utility include wall-to-wall carpeting, flooring,
wallpaper, kitchen cabinets, or “built-in” dishwashers or ranges.
      (4)   The installation of window coverings (drapes, mini-blinds, etc.) is
always a retail activity.
Reg. 12-415.3. Construction contracting; tax rate effective date.
   A.   In the event of a tax rate change, the rate imposed on gross income
from construction contracting shall be computed based upon the rate in effect
when the contract was executed, subject to the “enactment date” as defined in
this section. Gross income from a contract executed prior to the enactment date
shall not be subject to the tax rate change, provided the contract contains no
provision that entitles the construction contractor to recover the amount of
the tax.
   B.   In the event of a rate increase, in order to qualify for the lower
rate, the construction contractor shall, upon request, provide sufficient
documentation, in a manner and form prescribed by the tax collector, to verify
that a contract was entered into before the enactment date.
   C.   For purposes of this section, “enactment date” shall be:
      (1)   in the event an election is held, the date of election.
      (2)   in the event no election is held, the date of final adoption by the
mayor and council.
      (3)   notwithstanding the above, nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent the town from establishing a later enactment date.
Reg. 12-416.1. Speculative builders: homeowner’s bona fide non-business sale of
a family residence.
   (a)   A sale of a custom home, regardless of the stage of completion of such
home shall be considered a “homeowner’s bona fide non-business sale” and not
subject to the tax on speculative builders if:
      (1)   the property was actually used as the principal place of family
residence or vacation residence by the immediate family of the seller for the
six (6) months next prior to the offer for sale; and
      (2)   the seller has not sold more than two (2) such residences (or, if
the residence is a vacation residence, two (2) such vacation residences) within
the thirty-six (36) months immediately prior to the offer for sale; and
      (3)   the seller has not licensed, leased, or rented the sold premises
for any period within twenty-four (24) months prior to the offer for sale.
   (b)   In the event that a homeowner of a family residence contracts with a
licensed construction contractor for improvements to a residence, the
construction contracting on a family residence shall be presumed to be for an
owner’s bona fide non-business purpose and all construction contractors shall
be required to report and pay the tax imposed on all such improvements.
   (c)   Purchases by a homeowner of tangible personal property for inclusion
in any construction, alteration, or repair of his residence shall be subject to
tax as retail sales to the ultimate consumer.
   (d)   “Owner” and “Homeowner” as used in this Regulation shall only mean an
individual, and no other entity, association, or representative shall qualify;
except that an administrator, executor, personal representative, or guardian in
guardianship or probate proceedings, for the estate of a deceased or
incompetent person or a minor, may claim “homeowner” status for such person if
such person would have otherwise qualified with respect to the specific
property involved.
Reg. 12-416.2. Reconstruction contracting.
   (a)   “Reconstruction (of Real Property)” shall mean the subdividing of real
property and, in addition, all construction contracting activities performed
upon said real property; provided, however, that each of the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   a structure existed on said real property prior to the
reconstruction activity; and
      (2)   the “prior value” of said structure exceeds fifteen percent (15%)
of the “prior value” of the integrated property (land, improvements, and
structure); and
      (3)   the total cost of all construction contracting activities performed
on said real property in the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the sale of
any part of the real property exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the “prior
value” of the real property; and
      (4)   the structure which existed on the real property prior to the
reconstruction activity still exists in some form upon the property, and is
included, in whole or in part, in the property sold.
   (b)   Except as provided in subsection (c) below, “prior value” means the
value of the total integrated property, with improvements, as existing
immediately prior to any reconstruction activity. Where, according to Title 42
of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a property’s full cash value for secondary tax
purposes is intended to represent the property’s fair market value, “prior
value” shall be the property’s full cash value for secondary property tax
purposes as determined by the County Assessor in the year immediately preceding
the year in which the reconstruction improvement(s) are or could have been
included in the County Assessor’s valuation. If the County Assessor’s valuation
is contested or appealed, the final determination at either the administrative
or judicial level shall apply. Where, according to Title 42 of the Arizona
Revised Statutes, a property’s full cash value for secondary property tax
purposes is not intended to represent the property’s fair market value, “prior
value” shall be the property’s fair market value prior to the reconstruction
improvement(s).
   (c)   “Alternative Prior Value” shall mean that as an alternative to the
“prior value” defined above, the taxpayer may use his actual cost of the
reconstructed property prior to the reconstruction, provided that evidence of
such cost is presented to the Tax Collector and is determined by the Tax
Collector, in his sole discretion, to be satisfactory. Such evidence shall
consist, at a minimum, of proof of the actual, arms-length acquisition price,
accompanied by a full appraisal of all property involved which appraisal shall
have been performed by a real estate broker or MAI appraiser specifically for
the purpose of assisting in the acquisition and further shall have been
performed on behalf of the seller or a lending institution which has lent at
least sixty-five percent (65%) of the acquisition price. (Only long term
lending - not interim or construction financing will be considered.) This
alternative value shall be used only if the property was acquired by the
reconstruction taxpayer not more than thirty-six (36) months prior to a “sale”
as defined below.
   (d)   A “sale” for the purpose of determining “alternative prior value” or
“reconstruction” only shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of the
execution of a contract of sale or a deed (joint tenancy or warranty) whichever
is earlier, to a purchaser or grantee of any single residential or other
occupancy unit. In addition to the foregoing, a lease with option to purchase a
single residential unit shall be considered a “sale” at the date of execution
of such lease if said option is exercisable by the lessee in not later than
nine (9) months. Further in the case of cooperative apartments, the sale date
shall be the date of execution of the contract selling (subject or not to
encumbrances, liens or security interests) of a share, or a sufficient number
of shares which entitle the purchaser to the occupancy of a residential unit.
In all cases a person shall include a husband and wife as a community, or any
co -occupants of a single unit as joint tenants.
Reg. 12-425.1. Distinction between job printing and certain related activities.
   (a)   Computerized Printing. Computerized versions of all items which would
be taxable under Section
12-425 if performed without computerized assistance are considered taxable
under that Section, and therefore, are not exempt services.
   (b)   Book publishing. The printing of books shall be deemed job printing.
Sales of books shall be deemed retail sales.
   (c)   Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not
be considered job printing for the purposes of this Chapter.
Reg. 12-435.1. Distinction between publishing of periodicals and certain
related activities.
   (a)   Book publishing shall not be considered publication of newspapers,
magazines, or other periodicals for purposes of this Chapter. Sales of books
shall be deemed retail sales. The printing of books shall be deemed job
printing.
   (b)   Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not
be considered job printing for the purposes of this Chapter.
Reg. 12-435.2. Advertising income of publishers and distributors of newspapers
and other periodicals.
   Publishers and distributors of newspapers and other periodicals shall be
subject to the tax upon advertising imposed by Section
12-405 and such tax shall be allocated in the manner prescribed by subsection
(e) of Section
12-435.
Reg. 12-445.1. (Reserved)

   (a)   Room and board.
      (1)   Rooming houses, lodges, or other establishments providing both
lodging and meals, shall maintain a record of the separate charges made for the
lodging and the meals.
      (2)   The charge for lodging shall be subject to the tax imposed by
Section
12-444 or Section
12-445. The charge for meals is subject to the tax upon restaurants and bars
prescribed by Section
12-455.
   (b)   Furnished lodging. A person who provides lodging with furnishings
shall be deemed to be only in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing of
lodging, and not in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing of such
furnishings as tangible personal property, unless:
      (1)   Any tenant of any lodging space may choose to rent, lease, or
license such lodging space either furnished or unfurnished; and
      (2)   The lessor separately charges tenants for lodging and for
furnishings; and
      (3)   The lessor separately maintains his gross income from lodging and
from furnishings separately in his accounting books and records.
      If all of the above conditions are met, such person shall report both
sources of income separately to the Town.
Reg. 12-450.1. Distinction between rental, leasing, and licensing for use of
tangible personal property and certain related activities.
   (a)   Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with
construction contracting. Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving
equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting activity.
Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal property (with or
without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an operator shall be
deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property. For
example:
      (1)   Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving equipment
with operator is construction contracting. Rental of these items without an
operator is rental of tangible personal property.
      (2)   Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is rental of
tangible personal property.
      (3)   Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal property,
regardless of whether or not an operator is included with the equipment rented.
   (b)   Distinction between equipment rental, leasing, or licensing for use
and transporting for hire. The hiring of mobile equipment (cranes, airplanes,
limousines, etc.) is considered rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible
personal property whenever the charge is for a fixed sum or hourly rate. By
comparison, the activity of a common carrier conveying goods or persons for a
fee based upon distance, and not time, shall be considered transporting for
hire.
Reg. 12-450.2. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal
property: membership fees; other charges.
   (a)   Membership, admission, or other fees charged by any rental club or
limited access lessor are considered part of taxable gross income.
   (b)   Gross income from rental, leasing, or licensing for use of tangible
personal property must include all charges by the lessor to the lessee for
repair, maintenance, or other service upon the tangible personal property
rented, leased, or licensed.
   (c)   Sale of a warranty, maintenance, or service contract as a requirement
of, or in conjunction with, a rental, leasing, or licensing contract is exempt.
Reg. 12-450.3. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of equipment with
operator.
   In cases where the tangible personal property is rented, leased, or licensed
with an operator provided by the lessor, the charge for the operator shall not
be includable in the gross income from the rental, lease, or license of such
tangible personal property if the charge for the operator and the charge for
the use of the equipment are separately itemized to the lessee and separately
maintained on the books and records of the lessor.
Reg. 12-450.4. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal
property: semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible personal property.
   (a)   The term “semi-permanently or permanently installed” means that the
item of tangible personal property has and is expected to have at the time of
installation a permanent location at the site installed, as under a long-term
lease agreement, except that the person using or applying said property may
eventually replace it because it has become worn out or has become obsolete or
the person ceases to have the right to possession of said property.
   (b)   An item of tangible personal property is deemed permanently installed
if its installation requires alterations to the premises.
   (c)   Examples of “semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible
personal property” include, but are not limited to: computers, duplicating
machines, furniture not of portable design, major appliances, store fixtures.
   (d)   The term does not include mobile transportation equipment or tangible
personal property designed for regular use at different locations or
customarily used at different locations, as under numerous short-term rental,
lease, or license agreements, whether or not such property is in fact so used.
      (1)   For example, use of a mobile crane, trencher, automobile, or other
similar equipment shall be considered a rental, lease, or license transaction
subject to taxation only by the city or town in which such business office of
the lessor is based.
      (2)   Other similar examples include, but are not limited to: camping
equipment, contracting equipment, chain saw, forklift, household items, invalid
needs, janitorial equipment, reducing equipment, furniture of portable design,
trucks or trailers, tools, towbars, sump pumps, arc welders.
   (e)   A rental, lease, or license agreement which specifies that the item in
question shall remain, under the terms of the agreement, located within the
same city or town for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days shall
be sufficient evidence that such rented, leased, or licensed item is
“permanently or semi-permanently installed” in said city or town, except when
the item is mobile transportation equipment or one of the other types of
portable equipment or property described in subsection (d) above.
Reg. 12-450.5 Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal
property: delivery, installation, repair, and maintenance charges.
   (a)   Delivery and installation charges in connection with the rental,
leasing, and licensing of tangible personal property are exempt from the tax
imposed by Section
12-450; provided that the provisions of Regulation
12-100.2 have been met.
   (b)   Gross income from the sale of a warranty, maintenance, or similar
service contract in connection with the rental, leasing, and licensing of
tangible personal property shall be exempt.
   (c)   Separately stated charges for repair not included as part of a
warranty, maintenance, or similar service contract relating to the rental,
leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property are exempt from the tax
imposed by Section
12-450; however, such income is subject to the provisions of Sections
12-460 and
12-465, and the provisions of Regulation
12-465.1.
Reg. 12-455.1. Gratuities related to restaurant activity.
   Gratuities charged by or collected by persons subject to the tax imposed by
Section
12-455 may be excluded from gross income if:
   (1)   such charge is separately stated upon the bill, invoice, etc. provided
the customer, and such amounts are maintained separately in the books and
records of the taxpayer; and
   (2)   such gratuities are distributed in total to employees of the taxpayer
in addition to customary and regular wages.
Reg. 12-460.1. Distinction between retail sales and certain other transfers of
tangible personal property.
   (a)   Charges for transfer of tangible personal property included in the
gross income of the business activity of persons engaged in the following
business activities shall be deemed only as gross income from such business
activity and not sales at retail taxed by Section
12-460:
      (1)   tangible personal property incorporated into real property as part
of reconstruction or construction contracting, per Sections
12-415 through
12-418.
      (2)   (Reserved)
      (3)   job printing, per Section
12-425.
      (4)   mining, timbering, and other extraction, but not sales of sand,
gravel, or rock extracted from the ground, per Section
12-430.
      (5)   publication of newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals, per
Section
12-435.
      (6)   rental, leasing, and licensing of real or tangible personal
property, per Sections
12-445 or
12-450.
      (7)   restaurants and bars, per Section
12-455.
      (8)   telecommunications services, per Section
12-470.
      (9)   utility services, per Section
12-480.
   (b)   Distinction between construction contracting, retail, and certain
direct customer service activities.
      (1)   When an item is attached or installed on real property, it is a
construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or
replacement of that item is construction contracting.
      (2)   Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are
retail sales.
      (3)   Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached or
installed are considered direct customer service activities (for example:
carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, landscape maintenance).
      (4)   Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are considered
construction contracting.
   (c)   The sale of sand, rock, and gravel extracted from the ground shall be
deemed a sale of tangible personal property and not mining or metallurgical
activity.
   (d)   Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real property
is considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. Examples of
consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air conditioning coolant,
but not paint.
   (e)   Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has
independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.
      (1)   “Tangible personal property which has independent functional
utility” must be able to substantially perform its function(s) without
attachment to real property. “Attachment to real property” must include more
than connection to water, power, gas, communication, or other service.
      (2)   Examples of tangible personal property which has independent
functional utility include artwork, furnishings, “plug-in” kitchen equipment,
or similar items installed by bolts or similar fastenings.
      (3)   Examples of tangible personal property which does not have
independent functional utility include wall-to-wall carpeting, flooring,
wallpaper, kitchen cabinets, or “built-in” dishwashers or ranges.
      (4)   The installation of window coverings (drapes, mini-blinds, etc.) is
always a retail activity.
Reg. 12-460.2. Retail sales: trading stamp company transactions.
   A trading stamp transaction is defined as follows: the trading stamp company
issues stamps to a vendor; the vendor then provides them to its customers; and
the customer then exchanges the stamps for merchandise from the trading stamp
company.
   The exchange transaction for the merchandise shall be deemed a retail sale
and the trading stamp company a retailer. All taxes imposed by this Chapter
applicable to retail transactions are therefore applicable to such exchange
transactions.
   The rate of tax shall be the retail rate based upon the retail dollar value
of the redeemed merchandise as expressed in the redemption dollar value per
book of stamps or portion thereof. The tax imposition described herein is in
lieu of any Privilege or Use Tax upon the business of issuing stamps, redeeming
the same, or using or storing property redeemed.
Reg. 12-460.3. Retail sales: membership fees of retailers.
   Membership, admission, or other fees charged by limited access retailers are
considered part of taxable gross income of the business activity of selling
tangible personal property.
Reg. 12-460.4. Retail sales: professional services.
   (a)   “Professional Services” refer to services rendered by such persons as
doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects, etc. for their customers or clients
where the services meet particular needs of a specific client and only apply in
the factual context of the client and the final product has no retail value in
itself. For example, opinion letters, workpapers, reports, etc. are not in a
form which would be subject to retail sales to customers. However, transfer of
items in a form which would be subject to retail sales (e.g., artwork, forms,
manuals, etc.) would not be considered professional services. The issue is one
of fact which must be resolved in each situation.
   (b)   Creative (“idea”) labor and design labor that do not result in
tangible personal property that will be or can be sold are deemed professional
services and, if charged separately and maintained separately in the taxpayer’s
books and records, are not includable in gross income.
   (c)   “Professional services” shall be deemed to include those items of
tangible personal property which are incidental to the services rendered,
provided such tangible personal property is “inconsequential”.
      (1)   Incidental transfers of tangible personal property shall be
regarded as “inconsequential” if,
         (A)   the purchase price of the tangible personal property to the
person rendering the professional services represents less than fifteen percent
(15%) of the charge, billing, or statement rendered to the purchaser in
connection with the transaction, and
         (B)   the tangible personal property transferred is not itself in a
form which is subject to retail sale.
      (2)   In cases where the tangible personal property transferred is deemed
inconsequential, the provider of the tangible personal property so transferred
is deemed the ultimate consumer of such tangible personal property, and subject
to all applicable taxes imposed by this Chapter upon such transfer.
   (d)   Examples:
      (1)   The transfer of paper embodying the result or work product of the
services rendered by an attorney or certified public accountant is regarded as
inconsequential to the charges for professional services.
      (2)   An appraisal report issued by an appraiser, reflecting such
appraiser’s efforts to appraise real estate, is regarded inconsequential.
      (3)   Use of a hair care product on a client’s hair by a barber or
beautician in connection with performing professional services is usually
inconsequential. On the other hand, if the barber or beautician supplies the
customer with a bottle of the product for the client’s use thereafter and
without the professional’s assistance, the transfer of the bottle of hair care
product is deemed not inconsequential.
      (4)   If a mortician properly segregates his professional services from
other taxable activities on his bill (invoice, contract), his gross income
would include only the income derived from the sale of tangible personal
property (casket, cards, flowers, etc.) and rental, leasing, or licensing of
real and tangible personal property. His charges for professional services
(embalming, cosmetic work, etc.) would not be includable in gross income.
Reg. 12-460.5. Retail sales: monetized bullion; numismatic value of coins.
   (a)   “Monetized Bullion” means coins or other forms of money manufactured
or minted from precious metals or other metals and issued as legal tender or a
medium of exchange by or for any government authorized to do so.
   (b)   Any coin shall be considered to have been transferred or acquired
primarily for its “Numismatic value” if the sale or acquisition price:
      (1)   is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) the value of the
metallic content of the coin as of the date of transfer or acquisition; and
      (2)   is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) its face value, in the
case of a coin which, at the time of transfer or acquisition, was legal tender
or a medium of exchange of the government issuing or authorizing its issuance.
Reg. 12-460.6. Retail sales: consignment sales.
   Sales of merchandise acquired on consignment are taxable as retail sales. In
cases where the merchant is acting as an agent on behalf of another dealer,
sales of the consigned merchandise are taxable to the principal, provided the
merchant makes full disclosure to customers that he is acting only as an agent
for the named principal. However, when the principal is not deemed to be a
dealer, such sales are considered to be those of the merchant and are taxable
to him.
Reg. 12-465.1. Retail sales: repair services.
   (a)   Fair market value of parts and labor charges. The Tax Collector may
examine the reporting of all transactions covered by this Section to determine
if an “arms-length” price is charged for the parts and materials. The
applicable tax may not be avoided by pricing a part, which ordinarily sells to
the customer at $10, at $5 and including the difference as “service” or
“labor”. In the absence of satisfactory evidence supplied by the taxpayer as to
industry or business practice, the Tax Collector may use the cost of the part
or materials to the taxpayer marked up by a reasonable profit, to estimate the
gross income subject to tax.
   (b)   (Reserved)
Reg. 12-465.2. Retail sales: warranty, maintenance, and similar service
contracts.
   (a)   Gross income from sales of warranty, maintenance, and service
contracts is exempt from the tax imposed by Section
12-460.
   (b)   Transfers of tangible personal property in connection with a service,
warranty, guaranty, or maintenance agreement between a vendor and a vendee
shall be subject to tax under Section
12-460 only to the extent of gross income received from separately itemized
charges made for the items of property transferred.
   (c)   The gross income derived from a maintenance insurance agreement, which
agreement is entered into between the purchaser and any person other than the
seller is not subject to tax imposed by Section
12-460. If the provider of the maintenance insurance agreement pays for
tangible personal property on behalf of the insured in the performance of the
agreement, such sales are subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this
Chapter.
   (d)   Charges for tangible personal property provided under the terms of a
warranty, maintenance, or service contract exempted under Section
12-465 are subject to tax as retail sales.
   (e)   However, gross income received by a dealer from a manufacturer for
work performed under a manufacturer’s warranty is not taxable under Section
12-460.
Reg. 12-465.3. Retail sales: sale of containers, paper products, and labels.
   (a)   The sale of a container or similar packaging material which contains
personal property and which is transferred to the customer with the sale of the
product is not taxable as a sale for resale. Examples of such nontaxable
containers include but are not limited to:
      (1)   packaging materials sold to a manufacturer of video equipment for
containment of the product during shipment.
      (2)   cellophane-type wrap sold to a meat department or butcher for
containment of the individually wrapped or contained meat.
      (3)   bags used to contain loose fungible goods such as fruits,
vegetables, and other products sold in bulk, where such bags or containers are
used to contain and measure the amount purchased by the customer.
      (4)   shopping bags and similar merchandising bags sold to grocery
stores, department stores or other retailers.
      (5)   gift wrappings and gift boxes sold to department stores or other
retailers.
   (b)   Sales of non-returnable or disposable paper (and similar products such
as plastic or styrofoam) cups, lids, plates, bags, napkins, straws, knives,
forks and other similar food accessories to a restaurant or others taxable
under Section
12-455 for transfer by the restaurant to its customer to contain or facilitate
the consumption of the food, drink or condiment are sales for resale and not
taxable.
   (c)   Where a retailer imposes a charge for gift wrapping and the charge
includes the container, paper, and other appropriate materials, the wrapping
charge shall be considered a sale.
   (d)   Charges for returnable containers, where the charges are imposed on
the customer, are subject to tax at the time of the transaction. A credit may
be taken for the amount of refund after such refund is made.
   (e)   The sale of labels to a purchaser who affixes them to a primary
container is a sale for resale and not taxable. Directional or instructional
material included with products sold are considered to be part of the product
and a sale for resale. However, the sale of items such as price tags, shipping
tags, and advertising matter delivered to the customer in connection with the
retail sale is taxable to the retailer as a retail sale to it, and is not
exempt as a sale for resale.
Reg. 12-465.4. Retail sales: aircraft acquired for use outside the State.
   “Aircraft acquired for use outside the State” means aircraft, navigational
and communication instruments, and other accessories and related equipment sold
to:
   (a)   Any foreign government for use by such government outside of this
State.
   (b)   Persons who are not residents of this State and who will not use such
property in this State other than in removing such property from this State.
This subsection also applies to corporations that are not incorporated in this
State, regardless of maintaining a place of business in this State, if the
principal corporate office is located outside this State and the property will
not be used in this State other than in removing the property from this State.
Reg. 12-470.1. Telecommunication services.
   (a)   Gross income from the business activity of providing telecommunication
services to consumers within this Town shall not include:
      (1)   charges for installation, maintenance, and repair of
telecommunication equipment which are subject to the provisions of Sections
12-415,
12-416, or
12-417 (construction contracting);
12-445 (real property rental);
12-450 (tangible personal property rental); or
12-460 (retail sales); depending upon the nature of the work performed.
      (2)   separately billed advertising charges which are subject to the
provisions of Section
12-405 or
12-435.
   (b)   Mobile equipment. In cases where the customer is being provided
telecommunication services to receiving/transmission equipment designed to be
mobile in nature (for example, mobile telephones, portable hand-held two-way
radios, paging devices, etc.), the provider shall, for the purposes of the tax
imposed by this Section, determine whether such provider’s customers are
“within this Town” as follows:
      (1)   by the billing address of the customer, provided that such address
is a permanent residence or business location of the consumer within the State.
      (2)   in all other cases, the business location of the telecommunications
provider.
Reg. 12-475.1. Distinction between transporting for hire and certain related
activities.
   The hiring of mobile equipment (cranes, airplanes, limousines, etc.) is
deemed rental, leasing, or licensing for use of tangible personal property
whenever the charge is for a fixed sum or hourly rate. By comparison, the
activity of a common carrier conveying goods or persons for a fee based upon
distance, and not time, shall be considered transporting for hire.
Reg. 12-520.1. (Reserved)
Reg. 12-520.2. Change of method of reporting.
   (a)   Any taxpayer electing to change his reporting method shall be
permitted to do so only upon filing a written request to the Tax Collector and
after receiving written approval of the Tax Collector. The approval shall state
the effective date of the change.
   (b)   The Tax Collector may postpone such approval to allow for examination
of the records of the taxpayer and may further require that all tax liability
be satisfied up to the effective date of the change.
   (c)   Failure of the taxpayer to notify the Tax Collector and await approval
before changing the method of reporting will subject the taxpayer to interest
and penalties if his original method of reporting would produce higher taxes
due the Town. When a person makes such change without the consent of the Tax
Collector, the Tax Collector may audit his books and records to verify the tax
liability as of the date of the change.
   (d)   Any taxpayer who has failed to indicate a choice of reporting method
upon the application for a Privilege License shall be deemed to have chosen the
accrual method of reporting.
Reg. 12-555.1. (Reserved)

WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM AND POLICY
§ 51.100 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   It shall be the policy of Colorado City to implement the regulations
and restrictions outlined herein to promote the conservation and efficient use
of culinary water.
   (B)   It is in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare of
Colorado City to require conservation of culinary water resources. It is the
intent of this subchapter to establish measures for essential conservation of
culinary water resources and to provide for equitable distribution of culinary
water supplies. It is further the intent of this subchapter to provide
additional measures for conservation of culinary water resources under
emergency conditions as determined by the Utility Board, the Colorado City
Council or Mayor.
   (C)   It is imperative that culinary water customers within Colorado City
recognize the importance of culinary water conservation in order to extend
existing culinary water supplies and assure sufficient culinary water supply to
preserve the public health and sanitation, and provide fire protection service.
(Ord. 2009-03, passed 6-15-2009; Am. Ord. 2015-02, passed 3-16-2015)
§ 51.101 IMPLEMENTATION OF MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Colorado City shall encourage efficient use of water resources and
conservation of all water resources on an on-going basis. Colorado City may
provide water conservation information and guidelines to its culinary water
users.
   (B)   Colorado City employees, volunteers, and contracted service providers
shall comply with all culinary water restrictions and conservation guidelines
established by this subchapter.
   (C)   The drought/water management plan will be implemented as follows:
      (1)   The 4-stage management plan will run as determined by the Utility
Board.
      (2)   Each stage of the plan will be noticed to residents by means of
posting in public places including the Town Office and the Colorado City Post
Office.
   (D)   Colorado City shall implement a 4-stage drought/water management plan
as determined by the Utility Board, Colorado City Mayor and Colorado City
Council. The culinary water restrictions do not apply to water use that is not
provided by the town (such as a private irrigation company). The culinary water
use restrictions for Stages 1, 2, 3 or 4 shall become effective when determined
by the Utility Board, and will remain in effect until the Utility Board declare
the water supply is adequate to return to other usage.
(Ord. 2009-03, passed 6-15-2009; Am. Ord. 2015-02, passed 3-16-2015)
§ 51.102 WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Stage 1: Reduction in water use. Reduction goal: 10%.
      (1)   Inside. Suggested voluntary conservation methods:
         (a)   Fix dripping and leaking faucets and toilets. A leak in the
toilet can waste more than 100 gallons of water a day.
         (b)   Do not let the water run while shaving. Filling the sink basin
when shaving uses 1 gallon of water, letting the water run uses 5 to 10
gallons.
         (c)   Do not flush the toilet unnecessarily. Consider installing
water-saving toilets. Water-saving toilets use 1.6 gallons of water, standard
toilets use 5 to 7 gallons of water each time it is flushed.
         (d)   Take shorter showers or fill bathtub only part way. Long showers
waste 5 to 10 gallons of water every minute.
         (e)   Consider installing low-flow showerheads.
         (f)   Do not run the water while brushing teeth. Turning the water off
while brushing your teeth can save 1.5 to 3.5 gallons of water.
         (g)   Do not run the tap to make water hot or cold. Keep a bottle of
drinking water in the refrigerator so you don't have to run the tap to get a
cool drink of water.
         (h)   Wash only full loads of dishes and laundry. A dishwasher uses
approximately 25 gallons of water; a washing machine uses 30 to 35 gallons of
water per cycle.
         (i)   Consider replacing any appliance that utilizes water with a low-
flow type appliance if such appliance is not already low-flow.
         (j)    Reduce or eliminate the use of the garbage disposal.
         (k)   Wash fruits and vegetables in a basin instead of under running
water.
         (l)   Notify hotel and restaurant patrons of water conservation goals.
         (m)   Serve water at restaurants only upon request.
         (n)   Encourage all hotels, motels, inns and bed and breakfast
establishments to change sheets no more than every 4 days for guests staying
that long, unless necessary or specifically requested by the guest.
         (o)   Adjust temperatures in buildings with water-cooled air
conditioners to require less water.
         (p)   Use of reuse water for construction purposes if it is available.
      (2)   Outside. Suggested voluntary conservation methods.
         (a)   Raise your lawn mower cutting height. Longer grass needs less
water.
         (b)   Delay planting any new grass, sod or other new landscaping.
         (c)   Do not fill swimming pools. If possible, cover the swimming
pool, an uncovered pool will lose 900 to 3,000 gallons of water a month to
evaporation, a covered pool losses 300 to 1,000 gallons a month.
         (d)   Use mulch around shrubs and garden plants to save soil moisture.
         (e)   Use a hose with a shut off nozzle if washing cars at home or
wash at a facility that recycles water. Washing the car with the hose running
uses 100 to 200 gallons of water.
         (f)   Sweep sidewalks and steps rather than hosing.
         (g)   Aerate turf areas.
         (h)   Know your plants water requirements and apply only the amount
required for good plant health.
         (i)   Monitor ET data. Know how much moisture is lost to
evapotranspiration (ET) as this is what needs to be replaced back into the soil
for good plant health.
         (j)    Monitor soil moisture to determine if watering is needed.
         (k)   Water between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.
         (l)   Avoid watering on windy days or midday when the evaporation rate
is the highest.
         (m)   Keep fire hydrants closed.
         (n)   Repair leaks in hoses, pipes, faucets and connections.
         (o)   Limit operation of non-recycling fountains.
         (p)   Limit city fleet washing by 30% to 50%.
      (3)   Mandatory restrictions on nonessential water use. No outside spray
irrigation use of water between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
   (B)   Stage 2: Mandatory water restriction. Reduction goal: 15 to 20%. Stage
1 restrictions will be in force.
      (1)   All parks, schools and cemeteries will be allowed to water every
other day during permitted hours.
      (2)   Residential and commercial water users will be allowed to water
outside during permitted hours on an odd/even concept as determined by address,
(i.e. even addresses water on even days, and the like).
      (3)   Noncommercial car washing requires using a hose with an automatic
shut off nozzle.
      (4)   Use of water for street and driveway washing will not be permitted.
      (5)   No planting any new grass or sod or other new landscaping.
      (6)   Water shall be served at restaurants only upon request.
   (C)   Stage 3: Additional mandatory restrictions.  Reduction goal: 25% to
30%. All restrictions included in Stages 1 and 2 are in force.
      (1)   No use of fire hydrants for purposes other than fire protection.
      (2)   No use of water for ornamental use including, but not limited to,
fountains, artificial waterfalls, and pools.
      (3)   No use of water for water games or to fill or top off swimming
pools, hot tubs, and the like.
      (4)   Culinary water will not be used to irrigate city parks or golf
courses or schools.
      (5)   Spray irrigation and hand watering may occur for a total of 15
minutes per landscaped area.
      (6)   Drip irrigation systems, bubbler or soaker hoses may be operated
for a total of 2 hours.
   (D)   Stage 4: Water rationing plan.  Reduction goal: 40% to 60%. All
restrictions included in Stages 1, 2 and 3 will be in force.
      (1)   No watering of lawns.
      (2)   No watering of gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrubs, and other
outdoor plants, except by means of a bucket, pail, or handheld hose equipped
with an automatic shut-off nozzle.
      (3)   The use of water for flushing sewers or hydrants by municipalities
or any public or private individual or entity except as deemed necessary and
approved in the interest of public health or safety and specifically approved
by the town.
      (4)   The use of fire hydrants by the Fire Department for testing fire
apparatus and for Fire Department drills, except as deemed necessary in the
interest of public safety and specifically approved by the town.

§ 51.103 EMERGENCY RESTRICTION.
   Additional restrictions on the use of culinary water may be implemented if
the Utility Board, the Colorado City Mayor and Colorado City Council determine
that additional emergency culinary water conservation measures are required.
Nothing herein shall prevent the Town Council from enacting another ordinance
or authorizing a further mayoral proclamation pertaining to limitation of water
use if such scarcity remains in existence.
(Ord. 2009-03, passed 6-15-2009; Am. Ord. 2015-02, passed 3-16-2015)
§ 51.104 PENALTIES AND SURCHARGES.
   (A)   The Town Council authorizes the town to issue citations for violations
of this subchapter. During Stage 3 or 4 restrictions, any owner, occupant or
person having an interest in, or control over, the property subject to this
subchapter who shall fail to comply with this subchapter after being given

Utility Hearing Officer shall not have any authority to consider questions of
hardship or inability to pay.
      (2)   The hearing may be continued for up to 30 days by either the
Utility Hearing Officer or by written request from the customer in order to
assemble evidence. The determination of the Utility Hearing Officer shall be
communicated to the customer either at the hearing, the continued hearing, or
within 15 business days.. The customer may make a written appeal to the Utility
Board within 5 days of the determination. The determination of the Utility
Board shall be final.
   (D)   Disconnects.
      (1)   If all delinquent charges for water, solid waste and sewer services
and all related late charges are not paid by 12:00 p.m. of the last business
day of the month that the disconnect notice was given and a hearing
determination is not pending, the utility services for the customer may be
disconnected. Utility meters may be removed from the premises as part of the
disconnection process. Unauthorized connection/reconnection to the utility
system will be considered theft of service and will be prosecuted according to
law.
      (2)   The utility services will not be disconnected for an additional 30
days if the customer has an inability to pay and provides medical documentation
from a licensed physician that disconnecting utilities would be life
threatening to the customer or a permanent resident residing on the customer's
premises due to life support equipment used in the home that is dependent on
utility service for operation.
      (3)   The utility services will not be disconnected for an additional 10
days if the customer has an inability to pay and provides written documentation
that disconnection would be especially dangerous to the health of ill, elderly
or handicapped persons due to weather below 32° or above 99°. A customer making
a request as outlined above may be required to enter into a deferred payment
agreement within 10 days after the scheduled termination date.
      (4)   Utility services may be disconnected without advance written notice
when there exists an safety or health hazard, evidence of meter tampering or
fraud, or failure to comply with conservation measures imposed during extreme
shortages.
   (E)   Reconnects. The services may only be reconnected for the customer if
the following are paid:

deposit for that customer does not equal the last 2 months utility usage, the
customer will be placed on "deposit watch" during which time $100 will be
assessed per month until the deposit is large enough to cover 2 months utility
usage. The deposit shall be pro-rated among all utility services; i.e. water,
sewer, gas and solid waste.

shall make a written application therefor on the Department's standard form, or
execute a formal contract. The Department's standard application form, when
signed by the Department's authorized representative as well as the customer,
becomes a binding service agreement. Receipt of gas service shall constitute an
agreement to abide by all provisions of the standard application form and this
chapter.
   (B)   Implied service agreement. In the absence of a signed service
agreement, the delivery of gas service by the Department and acceptance thereof
by the customer shall be deemed to constitute an agreement by and between the
Department and the customer for delivery and acceptance of gas service under
the terms and conditions contained in this chapter and the applicable tariff.
   (C)   Department's right to cancel service agreement or to suspend service.
      (1)   For any default or breach of the service agreement by the customer,
including failure to pay bills within the specified period, the Department, in
addition to all other legal remedies, may terminate the service agreement or
suspend service at the location where such default has occurred. No such
termination or suspension, however, will be made by the Department without 5
days notice to the customer, stating in what particular manner the service
agreement has been violated, except that no notice need be given in cases of

condition on the customer's side of the gas meter, or in case of utilization by
the customer of service in such manner as to cause danger to persons or
property, or to jeopardize service to the customer or others. Failure of the
Department at any time after any such default or breach either to suspend
supply of service, or to terminate the service agreement, or to resort to any
other legal remedy, or its failure to exercise on any 1 or more of such
remedies shall not affect the Department's right to resort thereafter to any 1
or more of such remedies for the same or any future default or breach by the
customer.
   (D)   Cancellation of service agreement.  Unless otherwise provided in the
service agreement, where the customer entirely suspends operations with the
intention to permanently abandon them, the service agreement may be cancelled
by written notice to the Department not less than 30 days before the date upon
which service is to be terminated. No such cancellation shall release the
customer from his prior obligation.
   (E)   Change of address of the customer.
      (1)   When the customer changes his address, he shall give notice thereof
to the Department at least 3 days prior to the date of change. The customer

not less than 3 days, to discontinue service.
      (2)   If the customer moves to an address at which he requires gas
service for any purposes specified in his service agreement, and at which
address the Department has such service available under the same tariff, the
notice shall be considered as the customer's request that the Department
transfer such service to the new address; but if the Department does not have
such service available at the new address the old service agreement shall, at
the option of the Department, either be considered cancelled or the customer
remain liable thereunder.
      (3)   If the Department has service available at the new address to which
a different tariff applies, a new service agreement, including the applicable
tariff, will be offered to the customer. The Department will make transfers of
service as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt of notice.
   (F)   Successors and assigns. Service agreements shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the respective heirs, legal representatives, or
successors by operation of law, of the parties thereto. The customer may assign
his service agreement to a third party only with the written consent of the
Department. The Department may, without the customer's consent, assign any
service agreement to any person or corporation, in any lawful way acquiring or

PURPOSE AND METHODS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Arizona has in A.R.S. § 48-3610 enabled the
Town of Colorado City to assume the powers and duties for floodplain management
and adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3609 designed to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Colorado City, Arizona, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-5-2009; Am. Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-17-2018)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Colorado City are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-5-2009; Am. Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-17-2018)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   Notify that potential buyers that the property is in an area of
special flood hazard;
   (H)   Notify those who occupy special flood hazard areas that they assume
responsibility for their actions; and
   (I)   Participate in and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and
disaster relief.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-5-2009; Am. Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-17-2018)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   (A)   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion, in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (B)   These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive
conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes.

would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town Council
of Colorado City requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

§ 151.47 STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   All manufactured homes that are placed on site or substantially improved
shall:
   (A)   Be elevated so that the bottom of the structural frame or the lowest
point of any attached appliances, whichever is lower, is at or above the
regulatory flood elevation; and
   (B)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may

§ 151.49 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.21 above are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge; and
   (B)   If division (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
151.43 through
151.49.

VARIANCE PROCEDURE
§ 151.60 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of law that variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel
of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the Town Council of Colorado City to help protect
its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are
so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements
in the flood chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly
limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more
detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can
be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations
in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-5-2009; Am. Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-17-2018)
§ 151.61 APPEALS.
   (A)   The Hearing Officer of Colorado City shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter as outlined in
Town Code
Chapter 153.
   (B)   The Hearing Officer shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   In passing upon the applications, the Hearing Officer, shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (C) above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Hearing Officer may attach the conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property; and
      (3)   The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for
exchange of state land pursuant to any flood relocation and land exchange
program. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Mohave
County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the
chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to Federal Emergency Management Agency.

2018-01, passed 1-17-2018)
§ 151.62 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood elevation, providing §§
151.40 through
151.49 above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond 1/
2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration
of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   (C)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      (3)   Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it
is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only
facilities defined in §
151.05 of this chapter in the definition of FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE; and
      (4)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of, the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this chapter shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a
fine of not to exceed $1,000 or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed six
months, or by both the fine and imprisonment. Each day that a violation
continues shall be a separate offense punishable as herein above described.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 AUTHORITY.
   This zoning chapter is enacted based on the authority granted by this Town
code and the laws of the State of Arizona, including but not limited to A.R.S.
§ 9-461 and § 9-462, which provide for the regulation of land use and
structures by municipalities in Arizona.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.002 TITLE.
   This zoning chapter shall be known as the Town of Colorado Town Zoning
Chapter and is referred to throughout this document as “this chapter” or “this
code.”

§ 152.004 CONSISTENCY WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND OTHER ADOPTED REGULATIONS.
   This chapter is intended to implement the planning goals and objectives of
the town general plan and other applicable adopted regulations. Any amendments
to, or actions pursuant to, this code shall be consistent with the general plan
and all applicable adopted regulations.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.005 APPLICABILITY.
   The provisions of this zoning code apply to all use and development of
properties within the municipal limits of the town, except for exempted
government owned property as provided by state or Federal law or as otherwise
expressly stated in this zoning code.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.006 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Provisions interpreted as minimum requirements. The standards and
regulations established by this chapter shall be construed to be the minimum
requirements necessary for the promotion of public health, safety, or other
general welfare. Minimum values are not intended to be target values. In some
instances, conditions may create the need to exceed stated minimum standards.
   (B)   Relation to other regulations.  The regulations of this chapter and
requirements or conditions imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not supersede
any other regulations or requirements adopted or imposed by the State of

development authorized by this chapter. All uses and development authorized by
this chapter shall comply with all other such regulations and requirements.
Where conflict occurs within this chapter or between the provisions of this
chapter and any other town ordinance, chapter, resolution, guideline or
regulation, (such as, but not limited to, fire codes, building codes, or
engineering standards) the more restrictive provisions shall control, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, unless otherwise specified herein.
   (C)   Relation to private agreements. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply regardless of any private agreements in the event that the provisions of
this chapter are more restrictive. Otherwise, this chapter shall not interfere
with, affect or annul any recorded easement, covenant, or other private
agreement now in effect, unless a development agreement has been authorized by
the Town Council and executed by recording the development agreement with the
County Recorder's office, pursuant to A.R.S § 9-500.05.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.007 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.
   The following rules shall apply to all properties in the town on the
effective date of this code:
   (A)   Violations continue. Any violation of the zoning code previously in
effect May 13, 2020 will continue to be a violation under this code and shall
be subject to the penalties and enforcement provisions provided in §§
152.105 through
152.112, unless the use, development, construction or other activity complies
with the provisions of this code.
   (B)   Uses rendered nonconforming under prior ordinance. Any legal
nonconformity under the previous zoning ordinance also will be a legal
nonconformity under this chapter, so long as the situation that resulted in the
legal nonconforming status under the previous chapter continues to exist. If a
legal nonconformity under the previous chapter becomes conforming because of
the adoption of this chapter, then said use or structure will no longer be
considered a nonconformity.
   (C)   Uses rendered nonconforming under this chapter.
      (1)   When a building, structure, or lot is used for a purpose that was a
lawful use before the effective date of this zoning chapter, and this zoning
chapter no longer classifies such use as an allowed use in the zoning district
in which it is located, such use shall be considered nonconforming and shall be
controlled by §§
152.120 through
152.125.
      (2)   Where any building, structure, or lot that legally existed on the
effective date of this zoning chapter does not meet all standards set forth in
this zoning chapter, such building, structure, or lot shall be considered
nonconforming and shall be controlled by §§
152.120 through
152.125.
   (D)   Applications filed prior to the effective date.
      (1)   Pending applications filed prior to the effective date.
         (a)   Complete applications for new developments or amendments
including, but not limited to site plan review and approval, conditional use
permits, and rezones filed prior to the effective date of this code may be
approved under the provisions of the zoning code previously in effect.
         (b)   Applicants with a complete application that has been submitted
for approval, but upon which no final action has been taken prior to the
effective date of this zoning chapter, may request review under this zoning
chapter by a written letter to the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   If the applicant fails to comply with any applicable required
period for submittal or other procedural requirements in accordance with the
zoning chapter in effect on the date the application was deemed complete, the
application shall expire and subsequent applications shall be subject to the
requirements of this zoning chapter.
      (2)   Planning applications filed after the effective date. All
applications for new developments including, but not limited to, site plan
review and approval, conditional use permits, and rezones, filed on or after
the effective date of this zoning chapter, including modifications and
amendments, shall conform to the provisions of this zoning chapter.
   (E)   Developments with approvals or permits.
      (1)   Conditional use permit approved prior to effective date. An
applicant for a use for which a conditional use permit has been approved prior
to the effective date of this chapter may file an application for a building
permit, even if the use does not fully comply with the provisions of this
chapter. If a building permit application is not filed within one year of the
date of approval of the conditional use permit, it shall expire. No time
extensions shall be permitted. Any re-application for an expired project
approval shall meet the standards in effect at the time of re-application.
      (2)   Final site plan approved prior to effective date. An applicant
whose development has received site plan approval prior to the effective date
of this chapter may file an application for a building permit in compliance
with the approved site plan and any conditions of approval, even if the
development does not comply with the provisions of this chapter. Upon approval
of construction plans for the development, a building permit may be issued.
Site plan approval for developments approved prior to the effective date of
this chapter shall be valid for one year from the date of approval. No time
extensions shall be permitted. Any re-application for an expired project
approval shall meet the standards in effect at the time of re-application.
      (3)   Preliminary subdivision plat approved prior to effective date. A
project which has a preliminary plat approved prior to the effective date of
this chapter may file an application for a final subdivision plat and
improvement plan approval, even if the subdivision does not fully comply with
the provisions of this chapter. If a final plat application is not filed within
18 months as provided by the general development and subdivision regulations,
of the date of preliminary plat approval, the preliminary plat shall expire. No
time extensions shall be permitted. Subsequent preliminary plat applications
shall comply with this zoning chapter and the town general development and
subdivision regulations.
      (4)   Building permit issued prior to effective date. Any building,
structure, or sign for which a lawful building permit is issued or for which a
complete building permit or sign permit application as determined by the Zoning
Administrator has been filed prior to the effective date of this chapter, may
be constructed and completed in conformance with the permit and other
applicable approvals, permits and conditions, even if such building, structure
or sign does not fully comply with this chapter. If construction is not
commenced in compliance with the applicable permit terms, the Building Official
may grant an extension in compliance with the provisions of the building code.
If the building, structure, or sign has not been completed before the building
permit or any extension of the permit expires, then the building, structure, or
sign shall be constructed, completed or occupied only in compliance with this
chapter.
   (F)   Waiver of requirements.
      (1)   Properties for which the owner believes the adoption of this
chapter has a direct effect upon and has caused a diminution of value. (A.R.S.
§ 12-1134)
      (2)   If a property owner has reason to believe the adoption of this
chapter and the requirement(s) related to this chapter have directly reduced
the fair market value of their property, a waiver of requirements from this
chapter, in favor of all requirements of the zoning chapter in effect previous
to May 13, 2020, may be applied. Actions establishing the initiation of this
waiver must be made before May 13, 2023.

   (A)   This chapter establishes the zoning districts applied to property
within the town, determines how the zoning districts are applied on the zoning
map, and identifies general permitted land uses and development standards for
each zoning district.
   (B)   Zoning Districts established. To classify and separate the uses of
land, buildings, and structures for implementing the town zoning chapter, the
town is divided into the zoning and overlay districts listed below.

   (B)   Map established.
      (1)   The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by
this code shall be designated upon the official “Zoning Map of the Town of
Colorado City.” The zoning map, together with all data shown on the map and all
amendments hereafter adopted, is by reference made a part of this code.
      (2)   The official zoning map shall be located in and maintained by the
Community Development Department and made available for inspection at Town
Hall.
         (a)   Any changes to the official zoning map shall be considered an
amendment to the official zoning map and filed in accordance with §
152.090.
         (b)   The official zoning map may, from time to time, be republished
to delineate any change of zoning approved pursuant to §
152.090 or any other amendments thereto.
   (C)   Boundary determination. Where uncertainty exists concerning the
boundaries of any zoning district shown on the official zoning map, the
following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following street or alley center lines, such center lines shall be construed to
be the district boundary.
      (2)   Where zoning district boundaries are so indicated that they
approximately follow property lines, such property lines shall be construed to
be the district boundary.
      (3)   Where zoning district boundaries divide a lot or parcel, the zoning
boundary shall be determined by using the scale of the zoning map, unless
indicated by legal description with distance and bearing or other dimension.
Such zoning district boundary shall be considered a "lot line" as defined
herein. If the area created by such lot line does not comply with the
designated district lot area and lot width requirements, zoning for the entire
parcel shall be that which is applied to the largest portion of the property.
      (4)   Where existing development has occurred across zoning lines, zoning
for the entire parcel shall be that which is applied to the largest portion of
the property.
      (5)   Where a public street or alley, railroad, or utility right-of-way
is officially vacated or abandoned, the property that was formerly in the
right-of-way will be included within the zoning district of the adjoining
property on either side of the centerline of the vacated or abandoned right-of-
way or easement.
      (6)   In case of doubt or disagreement concerning the exact location of a
district line, determination shall lie with the Zoning Administrator as defined
under §
152.074. The determination of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed in
accordance with the provisions of §
152.086(K).
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.026 AGRICULTURAL/RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose. Agricultural/Residential Districts are primarily
intended to provide for the continuation and preservation of rural living
quality on parcels of sufficient area to produce farm crops (and specified
compatible principal or accessory uses and structures) including related
agricultural business and support uses.
   (B)   Agricultural/Residential 5 (AR-5).  This district is intended to
promote and preserve low-density single-family residential and agricultural
development. Single family homes in this district may include site built,
manufactured, or modular. Mobile home prohibited.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.027 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose. Residential zoning districts are primarily intended
to create, maintain and promote a variety of neighborhoods that are comprised
of a range of compatible densities to accommodate the desired physical
character of the town. These districts primarily accommodate residential uses,
however some nonresidential uses are also allowed to provide public facilities
necessary to create a healthy and safe environment to live in.
   (B)   Residential districts.
      (1)   Residential-Estate/Two-Acre (RE-2A). This district is intended to
provide an open, country residential atmosphere on large lots. Lots are
typically larger than in the developed portion of the town and include keeping
large livestock. Single-family detached homes in this district may include site
built, manufactured, or modular. Mobile homes prohibited.
      (2)   Residential-Estate/One-Acre District (RE-1A). This district is
similar in intent and purpose to the Residential-Estate District, except that
the lot sizes are smaller. In general, the intent is to allow conventional
single-family detached housing, with large livestock. Single-family homes in
this district may include site built, manufactured, or modular. Mobile homes
prohibited.   
      (3)   Single-Family Residential-20 (R1-20). The intent of this district
is to provide a transition from rural residential estate development to more
urban residential neighborhoods. Development in this district is generally
comprised of large-lot single-family detached homes with more conventional
residential amenities such as sidewalks, public utility services and other
improvements. Single-family homes in this district may include site built,
manufactured, or modular. Mobile homes prohibited.   
      (4)   Single-Family Residential-12 (R1-12). The intent of this district
is to provide a transition from rural residential estate development to more
urban residential neighborhoods. Development in this district is generally
comprised of large-lot single-family detached homes with more conventional
residential amenities such as sidewalks, public utility services and other
improvements. Single-family homes in this district may include site built,
manufactured, or modular. Mobile homes prohibited.      
      (5)   Single-Family Residential-8 (R1-8). This district is intended to
promote and protect the single-family character of a neighborhood and to
prohibit incompatible activities. Development in this district should afford
non-motorized linkages to community and neighborhood services such as schools,
parks and shopping areas. All public utilities and facilities must be present.
Certain essential and complementary uses are permitted under conditions and
standards which ensure their compatibility with the character of the district.
Single-family homes in this district may include site built, manufactured, or
modular. Mobile homes prohibited.      
      (6)   Small-Lot Residential-2 (R-2). The intent of this district is to
provide for neighborhoods comprised of a mixture of single-family detached
homes and small-lot residential dwellings such as duplexes, townhomes, or patio
homes together with schools, parks, trails and other public facilities. This
district may serve as a transition between higher-density multi-family
residential districts and low-density single-family residential districts.
Single-family homes in this district may include site built, manufactured, or
modular. Mobile homes prohibited.      
      (7)   Multiple Family Residential-3 (RM). This district allows the
broadest range of multi-family residential types and is intended for locations
closer to primary intensity generators, such as large shopping areas or
employment centers. The district requires direct connection to higher volume
roadways and all public utilities. Provisions for various modes of travel and
pedestrian linkages are also critical.
      (8)   Manufactured Home Subdivision (MHS). The intent of this district is
to provide an alternative single-family living style for those families who
choose a manufactured home environment. Development in this district consists
of subdivisions where residents own individual lots. The development standards
of this district are intended to be consistent with the standards for other
single-family neighborhoods developed at similar densities. All public
utilities and facilities must be present.
      (9)   Manufactured Home Park (MHP). The intent of this district is to
provide an alternative single-family living style for those families who choose
a manufactured home environment, but lease or rent spaces rather than own
individual lots. Recreational vehicle parks developed in a safe and attractive
manner may also be located in this district. The development standards of this
district are intended to be consistent with the standards for other single-
family neighborhoods developed at similar densities. All public utilities and
facilities must be present.
   (C)   Residential use standards. Table 2.1-1: Table of Allowed Uses for
Residential Districts, lists land uses and indicates whether they are permitted
by right or with approval of a conditional use permit, or prohibited in each
zoning district. The Use Table also includes references to additional use-
specific standards that may be applicable to that use. The organization
headings and individual abbreviations utilized in the table are explained as
follows:
      (1)   Use category. The “use categories” are intended merely as an
organizational tool and are not regulatory. These use categories simply help to
organize the list of “specific use types” into common groupings for ease of
reference.
      (2)   Specific use type. The “specific use types” are regulatory and
function as the basis for defining present and future land uses that are
appropriate in each zoning district. Rather than list every possible individual
land use type, this list classifies individual land uses and activities into
specific use types based on common functional, product or physical
characteristics; such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers
or residents, and how goods or services are sold or delivered and site
conditions. Further definitions of each specific use type can be found in §§
152.135 through
152.137.
      (3)   Permitted uses. "P" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed by
right in that zoning district.
      (4)   Conditional uses. "C" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved in accordance
with the procedures of §
152.091.
      (5)   Not permitted. "NP" in a cell indicates that the use is not
permitted/prohibited in that zoning district.
      (6)   Use-specific standards. Section numbers listed in the "Supplemental
Use Regulations" column denote the location of additional regulations that are
applicable to the specific use type; however, provisions in other sections of
this chapter may also apply.
      (7)   Non-specified uses. When a use cannot be reasonably classified into
a specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple specific use types, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most
appropriate specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics
of the individual use or activity (including but not limited to size, scale,
operating characteristics and external impacts) in relationship to the specific
use type definitions provided in §§
152.135 through
152.137. Appeal of the Administrator's decision may be made to the Board of
Adjustment following the procedures under §
152.086(K).

5   Zero feet for dwelling units with common walls.
6   For Single-Family Attached uses within a common site, the minimum individual lot/dwelling
unit size shall be 1,500 square feet.
7   For Single-Family Attached uses within a common site, the maximum individual lot/dwelling
unit coverage shall be 95%.
 
   (E)   Residential site and architectural design guidelines. The purpose of
this section is to help provide a pleasant residential environment within the
context of higher density development. By applying principles of good design to
aspects and components of multi-family residential development, the town can
protect the fabric of existing neighborhoods as well as maintain the
community's overall high intrinsic value.
      (1)   Applicability.
         (a)   These requirements shall apply to development of new multi-
family dwellings or renovation of existing multi-family dwellings within the
Multiple Family Residential-3 (RM) Zoning District that has frontage along
State Route 389 in the town.
         (b)   These guidelines will be used by town staff and decision-making
bodies as a framework for evaluating residential development proposals and for
commenting on the design aspects of those proposed projects. The general
development and subdivision regulations should also be referenced for
additional site design standards specifically applicable to residential
subdivision developments.
      (2)   Architectural guidelines.
         (a)   Natural materials and deep earthtone colors are preferred, and
design elements should not consist primarily of metal, glass, plastic, highly
reflective materials and bright colors. Such materials may have limited
application in trim or accent areas, but should not be predominant visual
elements of the building(s) or site improvements.
         (b)   Large bland monolithic facades or rooflines and repetition of
very simple details which become monotonous in character should be avoided.
Building elevations should create a unique character which is emphasized
through interesting architectural details or façade articulation in each
component. For example, windows may be arched or rectangular, bayed out or
recessed, have raised borders, awnings, planter boxes or shutters.
         (c)   Simple, clean, bold projections of stairways are required to
complement the architectural massing and form of the multi-family structure.
Stairways should be of an approved building material as listed in §
152.026(E)(2)(d). Thin-looking, open metal, prefabricated stairs are not
recommended.
         (d)   All building facades should be designed with architecturally
finished materials, with the following recommended primary façade building
materials:
            1.   Modular masonry materials such as brick, block, and stone;
            2.   Precast concrete or aggregate panels with a decorative finish;
            3.   Stucco or stucco-like materials;
            4.   Wood, provided the surfaces are finished for exterior use and
wood of proven exterior durability; or
            5.   Other materials as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Site design/orientation guidelines.
         (a)   Buildings, structures, open space areas and other features shall
be oriented to protect and/or enhance major vistas and panoramas that give
special emphasis to mountains, and special man-made or natural landmarks.
         (b)   A system of attractive and safe pedestrian ways shall be
provided which link the various components of the development with each other
and link the site's pedestrian system with adjacent public pedestrian ways.
They shall also link the dwellings with adjacent land uses such as parks,
shopping centers, or schools, which are likely to be used by the residents of
the development.
      (4)   Circulation.
         (a)   The primary vehicular access into a multi-family residential
project shall be through an entry drive rather than a parking lot drive.
         (b)   Developments along ADOT controlled roadways shall complete a
traffic study analysis, including access needs, traffic control needs, highway
expansion needs, drainage management plan, and/or a cost sharing plan. ADOT
approval will be required as part of the development plan approval process.
         (c)   Access points along primary gateway roadways shall be placed and
designed in accordance with ADOT and/or town requirements.
      (5)   Utilities. All on-site electric utility and all other communication
and utility lines for buildings shall be placed underground.
   (F)   Additional development standards.
      (1)   Setback and height exceptions.  See §§
152.135 through
152.137 for additional development and design regulations.
      (2)   Parking and loading requirements. See §
152.056 for additional development and design regulations.
      (3)   Landscaping and screening requirements. See §
152.057 for additional development and design regulations.
      (4)   Signage requirements. See §
152.058 for additional development and design regulations.
      (5)   Exterior lighting requirements. See §
152.059 for additional development and design regulations.
      (6)   Further reference, as appropriate, should be given to the town
Uniform Building and Fire Codes, general development and subdivision
guidelines, floodplain management ordinance, and engineering design standards.
   (G)   Flag lots. A flag lot for one single-family dwelling may be allowed to
accommodate the development of property that otherwise could not reasonably be
developed under the regulations contained in this chapter or other titles
adopted by the city. The primary purpose of this section is not to make
development of property easier and more profitable. Rather, it is to serve as a
"last resort" for property which may not otherwise be reasonably developed.
      (1)   Factors. When property is subdivided, flag lots shall not be
approved by right but may be allowed after considering the following:
         (a)   More than two flag lots with contiguous staffs should be
avoided;
         (b)   Whether development of the property in question under normal
city land use and subdivision regulations is reasonable and practical;
         (c)   Creation of a flag lot should not foreclose the possibility of
future development of other large interior parcels that are not developable
unless a street is extended to them across other adjacent properties;
         (d)   A flag lot will only be considered for approval in the area of
the original Short Creek Subdivision (SCSD) sheets 5-28 recorded September 26,
2017, and not in any other parcels or developments;
         (e)   Flag lots will not be approved in any new subdivisions even in
the area of SCSD sheets 5-28; and
         (f)   Flag lots may not be further subdivided following initial
approval.
      (2)   Development standards. When flag lots are permitted, they shall be
subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   A flag lot shall be comprised of a staff (narrow) portion that
is contiguous with a flag (wide) portion.
         (b)   The staff portion of the lot shall front on and be contiguous to
a public street. The minimum width of the staff portion at any point shall be
26 feet. However, a greater staff width for lots within the sensitive lands
overlay zone may be required. The maximum length of a staff shall be 150 feet.
The maximum grade of a staff shall not exceed 12%.
         (c)   The minimum size of the flag lot shall be R1-12 single-family
residential.
         (d)   The size of the flag portion of a lot shall conform to the
minimum lot size requirement of the zone in which the lot is located.
         (e)   No building or structure shall be located within the staff
portion of a flag lot.
         (f)   The front yard of a flag lot shall be on the side of the flag
portion which connects to the staff. Yard setbacks shall conform to the setback
requirements of the zone in which the flag lot is located.
         (g)   A main building shall be located no more than 250 feet from a
fire hydrant, measured along a public or private right-of-way or along the
staff portion of a flag lot. An easement for any fire hydrant located on
private property shall be provided to the city for access to and maintenance of
the hydrant.
         (h)   Upon review the city may require installation of curb, gutter
and other drainage control measures in the staff portion of a flag lot to
prevent runoff from entering neighboring properties.
         (i)   Clear address signage shall be installed and maintained at the
street by the owner, including notice that the driveway is a private right-of-
way.
         (j)   Before a flag lot is approved the town's Utility Department must
approve the design and location of all facilities needed to accommodate a
single-family dwelling. Construction of the approved facilities must be
complete before a building permit will be issued for the lot.

§ 152.028 COMMERCIAL AND MIXED-USE OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose. The purpose of the Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts
is to provide for a variety of commercial and select residential areas, each
suited to specific retail, service, entertainment, and residential uses in
order to maintain compatibility with adjacent uses. These districts are
intended to provide attractive, well-designed developments that are
appropriately located along primary roadways and pedestrian facilitates to
serve large volumes of customers.
   (B)   Commercial and Mixed-Use Overlay Districts.
      (1)   Neighborhood Commercial District (C-1). This district is intended
to provide convenient locations for small scale retail or service related
establishments. These locations are to provide services and goods primarily for
the surrounding neighborhood and are not intended to draw customers from the
entire community. The location of uses in this district are limited to the
intersection of a collector street and local street or greater.
      (2)   Community Commercial District (C-2). This district is intended to
provide a range of retail sales and personal, professional and business
services required to meet the daily demands of the larger community. This
district may also act as a transition between high-density, centrally located
commercial activities customarily found in the Central Business District, and
heavier commercial/business uses found along the major highways. Businesses in
this district require high visibility and access along primary roadways.
      (3)   Regional Commercial District (C-3). This district is intended to
provide for major business groupings and regional-size shopping centers that
serve a population ranging from the overall community to the traveling public.
These centers may feature a flexible mix of large traffic generators such as
home improvement stores, department stores, restaurants, lodging and offices.
Businesses in this district are predominantly located along major highways,
maintain sufficient parking, and are buffered from traditional residential
neighborhoods.
      (4)   Central Business District (CBD). This district provides an office,
retail and business services area that serves the entire community. Uses are
allowed which complement the central downtown area and are suited to high
vehicular and pedestrian traffic areas. The CBD should also be a focal point
for meeting the needs of tourists visiting the community and provide a strong
community identity through design standards and main street activities.
      (5)   Mixed-Use Overlay District (MU).
         (a)   This overlay district is intended to require both residential
and non-residential uses, either vertically or horizontally, and to promote
site and building design that accommodates multimodal travel that creates
opportunities to live and work within the central downtown area.
         (b)   The mixed-use overlay district shall be utilized as an overlay
zone. Land classified in the mixed-use overlay district shall be limited to
those areas located within the CBD zoning district. Property so classified
shall be identified on the zoning map by both the underlying CBD district and
the mixed-use overlay designation. The mixed-use regulations set forth in this
section shall be in addition to those regulations set forth in the underlying
CBD district. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the mixed-
use overlay district and the provisions of the CBD district, the provisions of
the mixed-use overlay district shall prevail. If the mixed-use overlay district
is silent in relation to any development standard, the development standard
identified in the underlying CBD zone shall prevail.
   (C)   Commercial use and mixed-use overlay standards.
Table 2.3-1: Table of Allowed Uses for Commercial and Mixed-Use Overlay
Districts, lists land uses and indicates whether they are permitted by right or
with approval of a conditional use permit, or prohibited in each zoning
district. The Use Table also includes references to additional use-specific
standards that may be applicable to that use. The organization headings and
individual abbreviations utilized in the table are explained as follows:
      (1)   Use category. The "use categories" are intended merely as an
organizational tool and are not regulatory. These use categories simply help to
organize the list of "specific use types" into common groupings for ease of
reference.
      (2)   Specific use type. The "specific use types" are regulatory and
function as the basis for defining present and future land uses that are
appropriate in each zoning district. Rather than list every possible individual
land use type, this list classifies individual land uses and activities into
specific use types based on common functional, product or physical
characteristics; such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers
or residents, and how goods or services are sold or delivered and site
conditions. Further definitions of each specific use type can be found in §§
152.035 through 152.037.
      (3)   Permitted uses. "P" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed by
right in that zoning district.
      (4)   Conditional uses. "C" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved in accordance
with the procedures of §
152.091.
      (5)   Not permitted. "NP" in a cell indicates that the use is prohibited
in that zoning district.
      (6)   Use-specific standards. Section numbers listed in the "Supplemental
Use Regulations" column denote the location of additional regulations that are
applicable to the specific use type; however, provisions in other sections of
this chapter may also apply.
      (7)   Non-specified uses. When a use cannot be reasonably classified into
a specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple specific use types, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most
appropriate specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics
of the individual use or activity (including but not limited to size, scale,
operating characteristics and external impacts) in relationship to the specific
use type definitions provided in §§ 152.035 through 152.037. Appeal of the
Administrator's decision may be made to the Board of Adjustment following the
procedures under §
152.086(K).

minimum of 15 feet.
[2]    Zero setbacks are permitted for structures if adjacent structures also
have zero setbacks and regulations of the building code in force at the time
of the review are met.
[3]    Fifteen foot setbacks are permitted if adjacent parcel is zoned RM.
[4]    Rear setback can be reduced to five feet if adjacent to a public
alley.
[5]    Building height may be increased to 45 feet for development that
contains vertical mixed-use with residential above ground floor commercial
uses.
   (E)   Commercial and mixed-use site and architectural design guidelines. The
commercial and mixed-use design guidelines contained in this section have been
established to: create an attractive and functional setting for businesses
located along primary gateway roadway corridors; create and maintain an
efficient, functional, safe and pleasant built environment for residents and
visitors; and promote attractive, high quality development that will support
and enhance the greater community.
      (1)   Applicability.
         (a)   These requirements shall apply to development of new buildings
or renovation of existing buildings within any Commercial and Mixed-Use Overlay
Zoning District that has frontage along State Route 389 in the town, unless
otherwise specified within this section. In the case of mixed-use buildings,
the standards of this section and the standards of §
152.045(E), shall both apply.
         (b)   These guidelines will be used by town staff and decision-making
bodies as a framework for evaluating development proposals and for commenting
on the design aspects of those proposed projects. The town general development
and subdivision regulations should also be referenced for additional site
design standards specifically applicable to multi-family and commercial
subdivision developments.
      (2)   Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited within any
Commercial and Mixed-Use Overlay Zoning District that has frontage, or abuts,
along State Route 389 or Airport Avenue from State Route 389 to the Colorado
City Municipal Airport:
         (a)   Adult entertainment businesses;
         (b)   Marijuana dispensary;
         (c) Tobacco/Vape Shops;
         (d)   Massage parlors; and
         (e)   Tattoo parlors.
      (3)   Architectural guidelines.
         (a)   Natural materials and deep earthtone colors are preferred, and
design elements should not consist primarily of metal, glass, plastic, highly
reflective materials and bright colors. Such materials may have limited
application in trim or accent areas, but should not be predominant visual
elements of the building(s) or site improvements.
         (b)   Large bland monolithic facades or rooflines and repetition of
very simple details which become monotonous in character should be avoided.
Building elevations should create a unique character which is emphasized
through interesting architectural details or façade articulation in each
component. For example, windows may be arched or rectangular, bayed out or
recessed, have raised borders, awnings, planter boxes or shutters.
         (c)   All building facades should be designed with architecturally
finished materials, with the following recommended primary façade building
materials:
            1.   Modular masonry materials such as brick, block, and stone;
            2.   Precast concrete or aggregate panels with a decorative finish;
            3.   Stucco or stucco-like materials;
            4.   Wood, provided the surfaces are finished for exterior use and
wood of proven exterior durability; or
            5.   Other materials as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   Site design/orientation guidelines.
         (a)   Buildings, structures, open space areas and other features shall
be oriented to protect and/or enhance major vistas and panoramas that give
special emphasis to mountains, mesas, and special man-made or natural
landmarks.
         (b)   On-site pedestrian walks shall be provided to connect street
sidewalks to primary commercial and mixed-use building entries by the most
direct route practicable. Multi-building developments shall minimize auto/
pedestrian conflicts and maximize convenient pedestrian access between
buildings.
         (c)   Openings for vehicular uses, such as garage door bays used to
access vehicles into and out of a building for repair or storage, must be
located on facades that do not face the primary street.
      (5)   Circulation.
         (a)   Developments along ADOT controlled roadways shall complete a
traffic study analysis, including access needs, traffic control needs, highway
expansion needs, drainage management plan, and/or a cost sharing plan. ADOT
approval will be required as part of the development plan approval process.
         (b)   Access points along primary gateway roadways shall be placed and
designed in accordance with ADOT and/or town requirements.
      (6)   Utilities. All on-site electric utility and all other communication
and utility lines for buildings shall be placed underground.
   (F)   Additional development standards.
      (1)   Setback and height exceptions. See §§ 152.035 through 152.037 for
additional development and design regulations.
      (2)   Parking and loading requirements. See §
152.056 for additional development and design regulations.
      (3)   Landscaping and screening requirements. See §
152.057 for additional development and design regulations.
      (4)   Signage requirements. See §
152.058 for additional development and design regulations.
      (5)   Exterior lighting requirements. See §
152.059 for additional development and design regulations.
      (6)   Further reference, as appropriate, should be given to the town
Uniform Building and Fire Codes, general development and subdivision
guidelines, floodplain management ordinance, and engineering design standards.

§ 152.029 BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose. The purpose of the Business and Industrial Districts
is to provide areas that promote employment opportunities for existing and
future residents of the town and surrounding communities, while also protecting
desired or established residential and commercial areas from the potential
objectionable influences these uses may create.
   (B)   Business and Industrial Districts.
      (1)   Business Park District (BP). This district is intended to provide
sites for a range of business research and business park uses, including office
and administrative uses, designed to be conducted wholly within enclosed
buildings. Light manufacturing uses that complement the business park or
research park use that are free from nuisance factors may be permitted if
pertinent to the primary use. This district encourages the development of
attractive buildings in a campus type setting on well-landscaped sites which
may be close to residential areas.
      (2)   Service Commercial District (SC). This district is intended to
allow more intense business uses which are compatible with the developed local
economy. These uses generally require unique services such as truck delivery,
outdoor storage, major motor vehicle or boat repair, light manufacturing, or
other activities or operations conducted outside an enclosed building or
structure. Because of the character and intensity of these uses, this district
requires public services and should be appropriately located on primary
roadways or near major highways.
      (3)   Industrial Park District (IP). The intent of this district is to
provide for heavier or more intense industrial uses in areas which do not
encroach on the community's residential environment. Uses in this district
generally include manufacturing and industrial activities that may generate
nuisances that cannot be adequately mitigated on site. The IP district is not
appropriate adjacent to any residential district.
   (C)   Business and industrial use standards. Table 2.4-1: Table of Allowed
Uses for Business and Industrial Districts, lists land uses and indicates
whether they are permitted by right or with approval of a conditional use
permit, or prohibited in each zoning district. The Use Table also includes
references to additional use-specific standards that may be applicable to that
use. The organization headings and individual abbreviations utilized in the
table are explained as follows:
      (1)   Use category. The “use categories” are intended merely as an
organizational tool and are not regulatory. These use categories simply help to
organize the list of “specific use types” into common groupings for ease of
reference.
      (2)   Specific use type. The “specific use types” are regulatory and
function as the basis for defining present and future land uses that are
appropriate in each zoning district. Rather than list every possible individual
land use type, this list classifies individual land uses and activities into
specific use types based on common functional, product or physical
characteristics; such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers
or residents, and how goods or services are sold or delivered and site
conditions. Further definitions of each specific use type can be found in §§
152.135 through
152.137.
      (3)   Permitted uses. “P” in a cell indicates that the use is allowed by
right in that zoning district.
      (4)   Conditional uses. “C” in a cell indicates that the use is allowed
in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved in accordance
with the procedures of §
152.091.
      (5)   Not permitted. “NP” in a cell indicates that the use is prohibited
in that zoning district.
      (6)   Use-specific standards. Section numbers listed in the “Supplemental
Use Regulations” column denote the location of additional regulations that are
applicable to the specific use type; however, provisions in other sections of
this chapter may also apply.
      (7)   Non-specified uses. When a use cannot be reasonably classified into
a specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple specific use types, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most
appropriate specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics
of the individual use or activity (including but not limited to size, scale,
operating characteristics and external impacts) in relationship to the specific
use type definitions provided in §§
152.135 through
152.137. Appeal of the Administrator's decision may be made to the Board of
Adjustment following the procedures under §
152.086(K).

   (D)   Business and industrial development standards. The following
development standards identified in Table 2.4-2 apply to all principal uses and
structures in Business and Industrial Districts, except as otherwise expressly
stated in this code. General exceptions to these regulations and rules for
measuring compliance can be found in §§
152.135 through
152.137. Regulations governing accessory uses and structures can be found in §
152.046.

2   Zero setbacks are permitted for structures if adjacent structures also
have zero setbacks and regulations of the building code in force at the time
of the review are met.
 
   (E)   Business and industrial site and architectural design guidelines. The
business and industrial design guidelines contained in this section have been
established to: recognize the unique needs and characteristics of development
in business and industrial use settings; protect and promote long-term economic
vitality through the promotion of high quality development; and minimize
adverse impacts to existing neighborhoods and anticipated growth areas.
      (1)   Applicability.
         (a)   These requirements shall apply to development of new buildings
or renovation of existing buildings within any Business and Industrial Zoning
District, unless otherwise specified within this section.
         (b)   These guidelines will be used by town staff and decision-making
bodies as a framework for evaluating development proposals and for commenting
on the design aspects of those proposed projects. The town general development
and subdivision regulations should also be referenced for additional site
design standards specifically applicable to commercial subdivision
developments.
      (2)   Service Commercial (SC) Zoning District development guidelines. The
Service Commercial Zoning District allows for the placement of a wide range of
business and employment type uses. Given its service related function, this
district is often found in close proximity to established residential
neighborhoods. For these reasons, there is a greater degree of attention given
to how this district relates to adjacent uses. The following concepts shall
serve as a framework to guide development within the Service Commercial Zoning
District.
         (a)   Screening adjacent to residential. Any uses in an SC Zoning
District which abuts or is across a street from a residential use or zone shall
provide a landscape buffer at least 15 feet in width. The landscape buffer
shall include a minimum of one, 24-inch box, spreading tree per 30 linear feet.
A 100% opaque fence or engineered concrete/masonry block wall shall also be
installed on the residential side of the landscape buffer along all common
parcel boundaries.
      (3)   Industrial Park (IP) Zoning District development guidelines.
Development adjacent to residential. The designation of an IP zoning district
adjacent to a residential development or zoning district is prohibited.
      (4)   Properties with frontage along primary gateway roadway corridors.
Development of new buildings or renovation of existing buildings within any
Business and Industrial Zoning District that has frontage along State Route 389
in the town shall adhere to the following guidelines:
         (a)   Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited within any
Commercial and Mixed-Use Overlay Zoning District that has frontage, or abuts,
along State Route 389 or Airport Avenue from State Route 389 to the Colorado
City Municipal Airport:
            1.   Adult entertainment businesses;
            2.   Auto wrecking and salvage yard;
            3.   Marijuana Dispensaries;
            4.   Tobacco/Vape Shops;
            5.   Massage parlors; and
            6.   Tattoo parlors.
         (b)   Architectural guidelines.
            1.   Natural materials and deep earthtone colors are preferred, and
design elements should not consist primarily of metal, glass, plastic, highly
reflective materials and bright colors. Such materials may have limited
application in trim or accent areas, but should not be predominant visual
elements of the building(s) or site improvements.
            2.   Large bland monolithic façades or rooflines and repetition of
very simple details which become monotonous in character should be avoided.
Building elevations should create a unique character which is emphasized
through interesting architectural details or façade articulation in each
component. For example, windows may be arched or rectangular, bayed out or
recessed, have raised borders, awnings, planter boxes or shutters.
            3.   All building facades should be designed with architecturally
finished materials, with the following recommended primary façade building
materials:
               a.   Modular masonry materials such as brick, block, and stone;
               b.   Precast concrete or aggregate panels with a decorative
finish;
               c.   Stucco or stucco-like materials;
               d.   Wood, provided the surfaces are finished for exterior use
and wood of proven exterior durability; or
               e.   Other materials as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   Site design/orientation guidelines.
            1.   Buildings, structures, open space areas and other features
shall be oriented to protect and/or enhance major vistas and panoramas that
give special emphasis to mountains, mesas, and special man-made or natural
landmarks.
            2.   Multi-building developments shall minimize auto/pedestrian
conflicts and maximize convenient pedestrian access between buildings.
         (d)   Circulation.
            1.   Developments along ADOT controlled roadways shall complete a
traffic study analysis, including access needs, traffic control needs, highway
expansion needs, drainage management plan, and/or a cost sharing plan. ADOT
approval will be required as part of the development plan approval process.
            2.   Access points along primary gateway roadways shall be placed
and designed in accordance with ADOT and/or town requirements.
   (F)   Additional development standards.
      (1)   Setback and height exceptions. See §§
152.135 through
152.137 for additional development and design regulations.
      (2)   Parking and loading requirements. See §
152.056 for additional development and design regulations.
      (3)   Landscaping and screening requirements. See §
152.057 for additional development and design regulations.
      (4)   Signage requirements. See §
152.058 for additional development and design regulations.
      (5)   Exterior lighting requirements. See §
152.059 for additional development and design regulations.
      (6)   Further reference, as appropriate, should be given to the town
Uniform Building and Fire Codes, general development and subdivision
guidelines, floodplain management ordinance, and engineering design standards.

§ 152.030 PLANNED AREA DEVELOPMENT (PAD) DISTRICT.
   (A)   Request on or after May 13, 2020. On or after May 13, 2020, any
request for a Planned Development (PD) zoning district or for modification or
change in an approved PD zoning district shall be made pursuant to this
section.
   (B)   General purpose. A Planned Area Development (PAD) is intended to allow
an applicant maximum flexibility in exchange for a more creative approach to
land planning and building design that could not be achieved through strict
adherence to the terms of this code. PADs may be approved pursuant to the
procedure and approval criteria in §
152.090.
   (C)   Applicability.
      (1)   A Planned Area Development District shall conform to the general
plan as adopted or amended from time to time, shall conform to all regulations
pertaining to land development within this code and the subdivision ordinance,
and all other rules, regulations, specifications and standards set forth in all
other applicable town codes, unless specific deviations are approved by the
Town Council during the PAD approval process.
      (2)   The area for a PAD shall consist of a single parcel of land or a
contiguous group of parcels with a combined minimum size of five acres.
   (D)   Standards eligible for modification. Unless otherwise expressly
modified as part of the PAD approval process, PADs shall utilize the base
zoning districts and all applicable standards established in this code to
regulate all proposed uses and development. The Town Council is authorized to
approve PADs that deviate from strict compliance with specified standards if
they determine that the resulting development satisfies the approval criteria
of division (E) below. The PAD standards may be more or less restrictive than
those in the code. PAD zoning may be used to:
      (1)   Specify the location of base zoning districts and define standards
for the modification of these locations within the specified PAD area.
      (2)   Define which uses permitted by right or by conditional use permit
within a base zoning district (as specified in Tables 2.2-1, 2.3-1, 2.4-1, and
2.5-1) will be permitted within said PAD zoning districts. PAD zoning districts
may not include uses that are not permitted within a base zoning district, but
may modify or define standards for the operation and performance of permitted
uses within PAD zoning districts.
      (3)   Define development standards pertaining to the size, dimensions,
height, lot coverage, placement, or setback of uses. However, the total number
of dwelling units in a PAD plan shall not exceed the maximum number permitted
by the general plan density for the total area of the PAD designated for
residential use.
      (4)   Specify the location, extent, and design standards for open space,
landscaping, amenities, screening and buffers, and signage.
      (5)   Specify the location and design of public/private streets, drives,
parking, pedestrian, and bikeways.
      (6)   Specify the timing, sequencing, and phasing of development,
including coordinating the type, location, and intensity of development
permitted with the construction and availability of public facilities and
services.
      (7)   Provide for the construction of public improvements and facilities
onsite or within public easements and rights-of-way abutting the site as
required to serve and benefit development within the PAD area or as may be
required to mitigate impacts resulting from the development on other properties
and uses outside of the PAD area.
   (E)   Approval criteria.
      (1)   Before approving a preliminary PAD, the Commission will ensure that
the application meets the following standards:
         (a)   Conformance to the general plan. The development must conform
with the objectives of the general plan.
         (b)   Balance and integration with the neighborhood. The design shall
be integrated and compatible with the neighborhood and shall strive to be in
harmony with the scale and bulk of surrounding properties.
         (c)   Adequacy of street network. The proposed streets are suitable
and adequate to carry anticipated traffic and that the density will not
generate traffic in such amounts to overload the street network outside of the
PAD area.
         (d)   Adequacy of infrastructure. That the impact created by the
development can be accommodated by the existing infrastructure system (police
and fire protection, parks, schools, water supply, sanitary sewer, solid waste
disposal, etc.)
         (e)   Relationship to physical features. The location of buildings and
structures shall respect the natural terrain of the site and shall be
functionally integrated with any natural features of the landscape to include
the preservation of views and vistas.
         (f)   Environmental impacts. Management of environmental impacts,
including drainage, soils, and archaeological.
         (g)   Upon approval through §
152.090, the preliminary PAD shall be placed on file in the Planning Department
pending approval of the final PAD.
      (2)   (a)   Application for final PAD approval shall follow the
requirements of §
152.090 process and contain the following:
            1.   Final legal documents specifying control of common areas;
            2.   If applicable, a plat of the property as required by the
general development and subdivision regulations of the town and plan of
required documents; and
            3.   If applicable, assurance of construction and completion of
required public and private improvements in the form as specified in § 413 of
the General Development and Subdivision Regulations of the town.
         (b)   The final development plan shall include any changes,
alterations, additions or deletions requested by the Planning Commission and/or
Town Council in its grant of Preliminary PAD approval. Except for these
modifications, the final PAD shall not deviate from the approved Preliminary
PAD.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.031 AIRPORT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose. The purpose of the airport districts is to promote
and develop compatibility between airport activity and the surrounding area in
the vicinity of the town municipal airport. These districts are designed to
prohibit potential hazards and maintain public health and safety in the
vicinity of the airport by minimizing exposure to crash hazards and high noise
levels generated by airport operations and to encourage future development
which is compatible with the continued operations of the airport.
   (B)   Airport Districts and overlay zones.
      (1)   Airport Property District (AP). It is the intent of this district
to encourage utilization patterns which promote viable and long-term growth of
the town municipal airport and of airport-related business and industry.
Utilization and development patterns must be amenable to regulations, purposes
and directions of the town airport master plan plus all applicable federal,
state and local laws, ordinances and regulations.
      (2)   Colorado City Airport Overlay Zoning.  The Town of Colorado City
Municipal Airport Overlay Zones are in
Chapter 156 of the Town of Colorado City Code of Ordinances.
   (C)   Airport use standards.
      (1)   The following airport related uses shall be permitted within the AP
zoning district:
         (a)   Airport structures and facilities that are necessary for the
operation of the airport and for the control of air traffic therefrom;
         (b)   Fixed base operators (FBOs); and
         (c)   Heliports, tourism operators, and ground school training.
      (2)   All other uses in the AP district and the Colorado City Municipal
Airport overlay zones shall require a conditional use permit, special event
permit or a temporary use permit that are consistent with the Airport Master
Plan. As part of the approval process, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
give strong consideration to the recommendations and conditions forwarded to it
by the Airport Advisory Board.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be
made of land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft; make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others; result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport; impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or
otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or
maneuvering of aircraft, intending to use the airport.
   (D)   Airport development standards.
      (1)   Site plan review and approval, as outlined in §
152.095 of this code, shall be required for all development and construction
within the specific boundaries of the airport districts and zones. All
development standards such as setbacks, heights, and lot coverage shall be
shown on the approved site plan, unless otherwise stated herein. It is required
that the Airport Advisory Board review all site plans and conditional use
permit requests and advise the Planning and Zoning Commission of any known or
potential impacts or conditions that might be caused by the proposed
development or the conditional use permit.
      (2)   Building heights within the boundaries of the airport districts and
zones shall be as set forth in the federal aviation regulations (FAR) part 77
airspace plan, the town airport master plan, and the underlying zoning
district, with no allowances for exceptions to the building height unless a
variance is granted by the town. The most restrictive guidelines shall apply.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no vegetation or tree
shall be planted or allowed to grow, or be maintained in any airport district
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.032 SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose. The purpose of the special districts is to recognize
there are unique areas within the town that require special treatment to
provide for their continuance or preservation. Unlike residential, commercial
or industrial zoning districts that exist to regulate development, special
districts provide mechanisms for the protection of undeveloped areas, federal
lands, or recreational resources that are located within the town.
   (B)   Special Districts.
      (1)   Future Development District (FD). The intent of the Future
Development District is to recognize that many areas of the town are not likely
to develop in the near future and possibly cannot be served at present with
public facilities. Therefore, any uses would require that conditions change
significantly and a change to another district would then be justified. Some
outdoor recreational uses that require minimal facilities can be permitted in
these outlying areas when properly developed and controlled.
      (2)   Federal Lands District (FL). The intent and purpose of the Federal
Lands District is to conserve natural resources, protect scenic vistas, and
provide recreational opportunities for undeveloped federal lands that are
administered by the Bureau of Land Management or other federal agencies. Land
within this district shall preclude future development, unless a significant
change in conditions occurs, and only if a change to another district is
approved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or as directed by and
pursuant to applicable Federal law and jurisdiction. This district shall in no
way diminish, modify, amend, interfere with, or change the rights, duties and
privileges of the lands federal ownership and enjoyment as property of the
United States.
      (3)   Parks/Open Space District (POS). The intent of this district is to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community by
protecting and preserving open space as a limited and valuable resource which
conserves natural resources, protects scenic vistas, provides recreational
opportunities, and contributes to the overall quality of life in the town.
   (C)   Parks/open space use standards.

§ 152.033 MEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   General purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide uniform
measures for interpretation and enforcement of this code.
   (B)   Setback regulations. This section establishes setback standards to
ensure the provision of open areas for access to and around structures,
maintain natural light and ventilation for individual properties, separation of
incompatible land uses, and space for landscaping, privacy, traffic safety, and
visibility.
      (1)   Setback requirements. All structures shall conform to the setback
requirements as provided within this chapter, unless otherwise provided in
division (B)(3) below.
      (2)   Setback measurement.  Setbacks shall be measured as follows:
         (a)   Front setback. The front setback shall be measured at right
angles from the nearest point on the front property line (or edge of pavement
for lots along private streets) to the nearest wall of the structure.
         (b)   Side and street side setback. The side and street side setbacks
shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the side property
line to the nearest wall of the structure, establishing a setback line parallel
to the side property line, that extends between the front and rear yards.
         (c)   Rear setback. The rear setback shall be measured at right angles
from the nearest point on the rear property line to the nearest wall of the
structure, establishing a setback line parallel to the rear property line that
extends between the side yards.
      (3)   Setback encroachment. Every part of a required yard shall be
unobstructed from ground level to the sky, except as follows:
         (a)   Setback restrictions do not apply to: slabs, uncovered patios,
walks, steps, fences, hedges, or freestanding walls. Freestanding walls are
subject to any sight triangle regulations; or
         (b)   Certain architectural features and improvements may encroach
into required setbacks as follows:
            1.   Ordinary projections of window sills, cornices, eaves and
other ornamental features may project a distance not exceeding two feet into
any required yard.
            2.   Patio covers and ornamental features may project into any
required side yard, provided such features shall be a distance of at least
three feet from any lot line or setback line whichever is most restrictive.
            3.   Air conditioning units, pool pumps or similar mechanical
equipment may project into any required side yard, provided such features shall
be a distance of at least three feet from any lot line or setback line
whichever is most restrictive. Any mechanical equipment located in a required
side yard, based on the minimum requirements above, should be placed within a
side yard with no gate access to the front yard.
            4.   Vestibules, bay windows, nooks, chimneys or similar wall
projections with or without footings may encroach not more than three feet into
any required front or rear yard and not more than three feet into any required
side yard, provided the aggregate width of all such projections adjacent to any
yard does not exceed ten feet.
            5.   Uncovered open decks, patios and terraces less than 30 inches
in height may encroach into any required yard by not more than three feet.
   (C)   Height regulations. This section establishes height standards to
promote compatible transitions between differing land uses, ensure adequate
light and air to individual properties, and to accommodate good design.
      (1)   Maximum height. All structures and appurtenances shall conform to
the height requirements as provided within this chapter, unless otherwise
provided in division (C)(3) below.
      (2)   Height measurement. The maximum allowable height shall be measured
as follows:
         (a)   The vertical distance measured from the average finished grade
at the perimeter of the base of a building and/or structure to the highest
point of the coping of a flat roof or to the deck line of a mansard roof or to
the highest point of the highest gable of a pitch or hip roof.
         (b)   For lots with slopes of 5% or more, the height of a building
and/or structure is measured as the vertical distance from the foundation point
of the front elevation to the highest point of the coping of a flat roof or to
the deck line of a mansard roof or to the highest point of the highest gable of
a pitch or hip roof.
      (3)   Height exceptions. Notwithstanding specific regulations provided
elsewhere in this chapter, the following uses are permitted to exceed the
height limits within any district where the use is allowed, subject to the
following requirements:
         (a)   Parapet walls or cornices may extend to a maximum of three feet

SUPPLEMENTARY USE STANDARDS
§ 152.045 TITLE AND AUTHORITY.
   A vibrant, dynamic community needs a variety of land use activities to
satisfy the needs of its inhabitants. Because of their particular dynamics, a
number of uses require special standards to mitigate their potential adverse
impacts on adjacent properties. It is the intent of this section to identify
those land uses and to provide specific criterion and conditions to ensure
that, if permitted, they will contribute to the health, safety, and general
welfare of the town. The requirements specified herein are in addition to those
specified in the corresponding zoning district. In the event of conflict
between these standards and the underlying zoning district standards, the
provisions of this section shall apply.
   (A)   Purpose. This section details additional site planning, development
standards, and performance standards for specific land uses listed within §§
152.025 through
152.033.
   (B)   Adult entertainment business. In addition to the requirements of §

entertainment business.
      (7)   The adult entertainment business excludes from its premises persons
less than 18 years of age or 21 years of age if alcohol is served.
      (8)   No materials depicting specified sexual activities or specified
anatomical areas shall be visible from the exterior of the adult entertainment
business.
      (9)   All distances specified in this section shall be measured in a
straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the
property line of any adult entertainment business to the nearest property line
of any other adult entertainment business, school, church, public facility,
residential district or other land use specified in this section.

         (c)   Vacation home rentals are limited to individually or
collectively owned single-family or one-to-four-family house or dwelling units
or any unit or group of units in a condominium, cooperative or timeshare, that
is also a transient public lodging establishment or owner-occupied residential
home offered for transient use if the accommodations are not classified for

be provided as required by this section at the time any new building or
structure is erected or any new land use is established.
      (2)   Expansion of existing nonresidential buildings. When the floor area
of an existing structure is increased, additional off-street parking and
loading shall be provided as required by this section for the additional floor
area only, provided that the existing parking was legally established and has
not been reduced. If the number of existing parking and loading spaces is
greater than the requirements for such use, the number of spaces in excess of
the prescribed minimum may be counted toward meeting the parking and loading
requirements for the addition or enlargement.
      (3)   Addition of use to existing nonresidential buildings. When a new
use locates on a parcel with an existing use, all off-street parking shall be
provided to meet the total number of spaces required for the existing use and
the new use, unless the uses meet the requirements of §
152.056(E)(4) or alternative guidelines that are expressly allowed by other
provisions of this code.
      (4)   Change in use of existing nonresidential buildings. When a change
in use requires more off-street parking than the previous use, additional
parking and loading spaces shall be provided equivalent to the difference
between the number of spaces required by this section for the immediately
previous use and the total number of spaces required by the new use. A change
in occupancy is not considered a change in use unless the new occupant is in a
different use classification than the former occupant.
      (5)   Alterations that increase the number of dwelling units. The
creation of additional dwelling units through the alteration of an existing
building or construction of an additional structure or structures requires
added off-street parking, as required by this section, to serve the new
dwelling units. This requirement does not apply when sufficient off-street
parking exists to provide the number of spaces required for the existing and
new dwelling units.
      (6)   When required. Off-street parking and loading facilities required
by this section shall be constructed or installed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for the uses that they serve.
   (C)   General parking and loading regulations.
      (1)   Parking and loading spaces to be permanent. Parking and loading
spaces shall be permanently available, marked and maintained in good repair/
condition for parking or loading purposes for the use they are intended to
serve during the life of the use.
      (2)   Reduction in parking area. The owner or occupant of any building or
use subject to off-street parking requirements under this section shall not
discontinue or reduce any existing required parking without first having
established other parking spaces which meet all requirements of this section to
replace those being lost or except after proof that, by reason of reduction in
floor area, seating area or other factors, the proposed reduced area for off-
street parking or loading will conform to the requirements of this section.
      (3)   Restriction of parking area use.  Required off-street parking,
circulation, and access areas shall be used exclusively for the temporary
parking and maneuvering of motorized, operative vehicles. In all non-
residential zones, parking areas shall not be used for the sale, lease,
display, repair, or storage of vehicles, trailers, boats, campers, mobile
homes, merchandise, or equipment, or for any other use not authorized by the
provisions of this code. In all residential districts parking shall be
restricted per §
152.056(J).
      (4)   Located on same site. Parking and loading facilities shall be
located on the same site with the use the facilities serve or on a contiguous,
identically zoned lot that is incorporated into the development site. Off-site
parking facilities may be permitted subject to the requirements of §
152.056(E)(5).
      (5)   Located off-street. All parking and loading facilities required by
this section shall be provided off-street and shall not be located within any
public right-of-way, sidewalk, alley, or parkway, unless expressly allowed by
other provisions of this code.
      (6)   Surplus parking. The provisions of this section shall also apply to
parking and loading facilities provided in excess to those required, unless
otherwise expressly stated in this code.
      (7)   Surfacing and maintenance. All off-street parking shall be paved
with asphalt or concrete, and be graded and drained per the town engineering
standards and as approved by the Town Engineer and shall be maintained in good
condition free of weeds, dust, trash and debris. In cases of certifiable short
term or temporary use, parking lot surfaces may be constructed to a lesser
standard if approved during the development review process.
   (D)   Number of parking spaces required. Except as otherwise expressly
stated, off-street motor vehicle parking spaces must be provided in accordance
with Table 4.2-1: Parking Spaces Required.

      (1)   Multiple uses. Unless otherwise specified, lots containing more
than one use shall provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total
of the requirements for all activities.
      (2)   Non-specified parking requirements. It is recognized that
specifying a single parking requirement for some uses listed in Table 4.2-1 is
not reasonably feasible due to the far-reaching variation in use
characteristics that can exist within that specific use type. For those uses
listed in Table 4.2-1 that do not have a specific parking requirement
identified, the Zoning Administrator shall determine a parking requirement
based upon the requirements for the most similar comparable use, the particular
characteristics of the proposed use, and any other relevant data regarding
parking demand. In order to make this determination, the Zoning Administrator
may require the applicant to submit a parking demand study or other
information, at the applicant's cost. The parking demand study may include, but
is not limited to, estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable sources as
approved by the Zoning Administrator, and should include other reliable data
collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable
with the proposed use.
      (3)   Unspecified uses. Where buildings are constructed without uses
specified (i.e. shell buildings), the use with the highest parking requirement
among all uses specified for the zoning district where the site is located
shall be used to calculate off-street parking requirements.
      (4)   Uses not listed. Parking for land uses not specifically listed in
Table 4.2-1 shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator based upon the
requirements for the most similar comparable use, the particular
characteristics of the proposed use, and any other relevant data regarding
parking demand. In order to make this determination, the Zoning Administrator
may require the applicant to submit a parking demand study or other
information, at the applicant's cost. The parking demand study may include, but
is not limited to, estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable sources as
approved by the Zoning Administrator, and should include other reliable data
collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as, or comparable
with, the proposed use.
      (5)   Uses in the CBD Zoning District. The parking requirements for uses
in the CBD zoning district may be amended in the following manner:
         (a)   Parking requirements shall be half of those listed in Table 4.2-
1, with the exception of service stations, grocery and supermarkets, laundries,
and motels and hotels, each of which shall meet all requirements listed in
Table 4.2-1.
         (b)   A parking demand study may be prepared and submitted, at the
applicant's cost, to request a modification to parking requirements within the
CBD Zoning District. The parking demand study may include, but is not limited
to, estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable sources as approved by the
Zoning Administrator, and should include other reliable data collected from
uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the
proposed use. The study should also take into account peak operating hours and
both on-street and off-street parking conditions to accurately demonstrate
parking demand and supply.
         (c)   For any change of use within the CBD Zoning District that may
require an increase to available off-street parking that cannot be accommodated
on-site, §
152.056(E), the Zoning Administrator may accept a traffic management plan,
prepared by the applicant at their expense, which contains information on the
strategies, designated parking areas, peak operating hours, and information
indicating the applicant's ability to provide and enforce these elements over
time. The Zoning Administrator may impose conditions that are needed to ensure
the long-term compliance to the plan, including but not limited to a reserve
parking area, phasing, or contributions to other alternative means of
transportation or parking accommodations.
      (6)   Basis of calculation. When calculating the number of parking spaces
required results in a fractional number, any fraction one -half or greater
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
      (7)   Occupancy or capacity-based standards. For the purpose of computing
parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants,
calculations must be based on the largest number of persons working on any
single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity,
whichever results in the greater number of spaces, unless otherwise explicitly
specified within Table 4.2-1.
   (E)   Alternative parking provisions. Where conditions preclude the
provision of the number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 4.2-1,
the following alternative parking provisions may be available, subject to town
approval:
      (1)   On-street parking. On-street parking spaces in the right-of-way
along the property line, between the lot lines of the site, may be counted to
satisfy the minimum off-street parking requirements for non-residential uses.
One on-street parking space may be substituted for each required off-street
space. These provisions only apply to street frontages where on-street parking
is allowed and provided. The parking space credit shall be determined at the
time of site plan approval.
      (2)   Tandem parking. Shall mean a space where one vehicle parks behind
another, so that one vehicle must be moved before the other can be accessed.
Accessible parking spaces shall not be used for tandem parking spaces. Tandem
parking shall be limited to a maximum of two cars in depth and no less than
nine feet wide and 40 feet long. Tandem parking stalls are only allowed for:
         (a)   Residential uses. Tandem parking spaces shall be allowed for
single-family, duplex and townhome residential with spaces and access paved in
accordance with the town engineering standards.
         (b)   Multi-family residential uses. Tandem parking spaces shall be
allowed for condominium and multifamily residential uses, subject to the
following conditions:
            1.   The tandem spaces shall be reserved for and assigned to
dwelling units which are required to have two or more parking spaces; and
            2.   Tandem spaces shall not be used for guest parking.
         (c)   Non-residential uses. Tandem parking spaces shall not be allowed
for new non-residential construction.
      (3)   Shared parking.  The Zoning Administrator may approve shared
parking arrangements for developments or uses with different operating hours or
different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with all of the
following standards:
         (a)   Eligible developments or uses.  Shared parking arrangements
shall only be allowed for non-residential uses with different hours of
operation or different peak business periods.
         (b)   Location.
            1.   Shared parking facilities shall be located on the subject
property of the specified principal uses proposing to use shared facilities.
            2.   All shared parking facilities shall be located within 600 feet
from the subject site to the primary entrance of each principal use. The
distance of the off-street parking area to the principal uses shall be measured
along the shortest legal and acceptable pedestrian route. Acceptable pedestrian
routes are defined within §
152.056(K)(7).
         (c)   Parking study required. Those proposing to use shared parking as
a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements shall submit a shared
parking study to staff that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared
parking. At a minimum, the study must address the size and type of the proposed
development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking
turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that
will be sharing off-street parking spaces.
         (d)   Design and improvement standards. All newly-constructed shared
parking facilities shall conform to the same standards of access,
configuration, landscaping, lighting, layout, location, and size as are
required by this section for off-street parking spaces.
         (e)   Covenant required. A town-approved covenant shall be recorded
with the county that includes a description of the shared parking arrangement,
a requirement that all current and future tenants are notified of and shall
adhere to the same hours of operation and conditions of the shared parking
approval. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a
building permit or business registration/renewal for any use to be served by
the off-site parking area. The Zoning Administrator may grant permission to
dissolve a shared parking agreement only if all required off-street parking
spaces will be provided, in accordance with §
152.056(D) and (E).
      (4)   Off-site parking. The Zoning Administrator may approve the location
of required off-site parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the
principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with all of the
following standards:
         (a)   Ineligible uses. Unless expressly permitted, off-site parking
may not be allowed for residential uses or other convenience-oriented uses.
         (b)   Location.
            1.   Off-site parking may be allowed only in the CBD district, or
outside the CBD upon issuance of a permit for a special event.
            2.   All off-site parking spaces shall be located within 600 feet
from the subject site to the primary entrance of the principal use, unless a
remote shuttle bus or valet parking service is provided. The distance of the
off-site parking area to the principal use shall be measured along the shortest
legal and acceptable pedestrian route. Acceptable pedestrian routes are defined
within §
152.056(K)(7).
            3.   Required parking spaces for persons with disabilities may not
be located off-site.
         (c)   Design and improvement standards. All newly-constructed off-site
parking spaces shall conform to the same standards of access, configuration,
landscaping, lighting, layout, location, and size as are required by this
section for off-street parking spaces.
         (d)   Terms of off-site parking.
            1.   A town-approved covenant shall be recorded with the county
that includes a description of the off-site parking and a requirement that the
owner of the separated lot maintain the required parking for the life of the
use to which it is covenanted.
            2.   The owner or operator of a business that uses approved off-
site space to satisfy the parking requirements of this chapter shall
immediately notify the Zoning Administrator of any change of ownership or use
of the property for which the spaces are required, and of any termination or
default of the agreement between the parties.
            3.   Should an agreement for required off-site parking expire or
otherwise terminate, the Zoning Administrator shall determine a reasonable time
in which one of the following shall occur:
               a.   Substitute parking is provided that is acceptable to the
town; or
               b.   The size or capacity of the use is reduced in proportion to
the parking spaces lost.
            4.   If the above conditions are not met in the timeframe
identified, the use for which the off-site parking was provided shall be
considered nonconforming and any and all approvals, including conditional use
permits shall be subject to revocation.
      (5)   Electric vehicle charging stations. Each charging station counts
toward the minimum number of required parking spaces.
   (F)   Parking space dimensions.
      (1)   Vehicular parking space dimensions. All vehicular parking areas
shall comply with the minimum dimension requirements as set forth in Table 4.2-
2 and as illustrated in Figure 4.2-A.

Districts shall be exempt from this requirement.
            2.   The combined extent of residential driveway, maneuvering, and
parking areas shall not occupy more than 50% of the required front or street
side yard setback area or three stalls (nine feet by 18 feet) for lot widths
above 50 feet, whichever is greater.
            3.   The required front or street side yard setback area that is
allowed to be used for residential driveway, maneuvering, and parking areas can
be covered if the cover meets the following criteria:
               a.   Is open on three sides;
               b.   Is architecturally compatible with the dwelling unit; and
               c.   Does not extend into rights-of-way or easements.
         (c)   For all lots zoned AR, RE, R-1, R-2, MHS, and MHP parking of
vehicles within any interior side or rear yard is permissible, provided the
area is paved with concrete, asphalt, pavers, or gravel and is not located
closer than three feet to an abutting side property line, unless a shared
driveway is utilized.
   (K)   Parking area design and layout standards. In addition to meeting the
applicable off-street parking requirements of this section, the following
parking area design and layout regulations shall be complied with for all uses
allowed in each zoning district; excluding individual residential lots in the
AR, RE, R-1, and R-2 districts, unless expressly modified in the following
provisions.
      (1)   Access to parking areas and parking spaces.
         (a)   All parking areas shall provide access to a public street by
means of a paved driveway that extends on-site to a point not less than 20 feet
from the property line.
         (b)   If an off-street parking area utilizes a publicly dedicated
alley for access to a public street, the alley shall be paved the full length
of the alley. The use of an alley for access to a multi-family, commercial or
industrial site opposite any R-1 zoning district is prohibited.
      (2)   General parking design and maintenance.
         (a)   All parking areas shall be designed, constructed, and drained in
accordance with all applicable town ordinances, standards, and regulations.
         (b)   Vehicles are prohibited from parking in the sight triangle. The
sight triangle is located at the intersection of two streets or the
intersection of a street and a driveway. The sight triangle is present on all
corner lots and is measured by extending the property lines until they
intersect. Each of the two legs of the sight triangle shall measure 30 feet in
length along the property line and/or driveway and shall be connected by the
third side of the triangle. No curb cuts, driveways, maneuvering areas, and
minimal landscaping shall be permitted within the described triangular area.
         (c)   All parking spaces shall be permanently marked. Circulation
aisles, approach lanes, and turning areas shall be clearly marked with
directional arrows and lines to ensure safe traffic movement.
         (d)   All required off-street parking areas shall be maintained in a
debris-free, pothole-free, and excessive crack-free condition; as determined by
the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Parking circulation design.
         (a)   Drive aisles and maneuvering areas shall be designed to
facilitate the safe movement of vehicles without posing a danger to pedestrians
or impeding the function of the parking area.
         (b)   Parking areas that accommodate 20 or more vehicles must maintain
continuous circulation patterns, with no dead-ends, and safe access to public
streets.
         (c)   Ninety degree parking areas that accommodate less than ten
vehicles and terminate in a dead-end shall provide a five foot maneuvering area
for the width of the aisle to assist in turning movements.
         (d)   All off-street parking areas shall be designed so as to provide
ingress and egress from a public street by the forward motion of the vehicle.
Required off-street parking spaces shall be accessible without backing into or
otherwise re-entering a public right-of-way.
         (e)   All off-street parking areas must have the necessary dimensions
for the on-site maneuvering of refuse and fire trucks. If off-site maneuvering
is necessary, a permanent, recorded cross-access easement must be filed with
the Community Development Department prior to issuance of a building permit.
      (4)   Shared access. Parking areas shall provide reasonable connectivity
to adjacent parking areas, when requested by the town to promote convenience,
safety and efficient circulation. A cross access agreement guaranteeing the
continued availability of the shared access between the properties and running
with the land shall be recorded by the owners of the abutting properties.
      (5)   Curbing and wheel stops.
         (a)   Continuous curbing at least six inches high and six inches wide
shall be provided around the perimeter of all parking and drive aisle areas.
Curbing located adjacent to stormwater facilities may contain curb cuts to
allow for necessary drainage.
         (b)   To avoid conflicts or safety hazards, concrete wheel stops at
least four inches high and six inches wide shall be located at least two feet
from any adjacent wall, pole, fence, property line, walkway, sidewalk,
landscape area or any other obstruction over four inches in height where
parking is located, unless other provisions within this section are met. The
two-foot overhang area shall be measured from the front end of the space to the
rear of the wheel stop.
         (c)   The curbs adjacent to walkways or sidewalks may be used as wheel
stops, allowing the car to extend into or overhang the sidewalk, only if a
sidewalk with a width of six feet is provided. Where such overhang is used, the
length of the parking space may be reduced by two feet. Under no circumstances
shall vehicles be allowed to extend into or overhang abutting right-of-way and/
or private property.
         (d)   The curbs around landscape areas and/or planters may be used as
wheel stops, allowing the car to overhang the landscape area, only if the
landscape area is a minimum of two feet wide for single row parking or a
minimum of seven feet wide for opposing parking rows. Where such overhang is
used, the length of the parking space may be reduced by two feet. Any plants or
landscape materials within the two-foot overhang may not extend more than two
inches above the six inch curb. All sprinklers should be placed outside of the
bumper overhang or aligned with the parking space stripe so they are out of
range of car bumpers. Use of such bumper overhangs reduces impervious surfaces
and is encouraged. Under no circumstances shall vehicles be allowed to extend
into or overhang abutting right-of-way and/or private property.
      (6)   Stacking spaces.
         (a)   Required stacking spaces. In addition to meeting the off-street
parking requirements of this section, all drive-through facilities shall
provide vehicle stacking spaces in accordance with the following table:

                                      Zoning Administrator shall determine a
                                      stacking requirement based upon the
                                      requirements for the most similar
Other                                 comparable use, the particular
                                      characteristics of the proposed use, and
                                      any other relevant data regarding
                                      stacking demand
 
         (b)   Design and layout of stacking spaces.
            1.   Stacking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet by 20 feet in
size.
            2.   Stacking spaces shall not interfere with on- or off-site
traffic movements or movements into or out of off-street parking spaces.
            3.   Stacking spaces must be separated from other internal
driveways by striping or raised medians if deemed necessary by the Zoning
Administrator.
         (c)   Exceptions. Exceptions may be granted when a traffic or parking
study demonstrates the need for lower stacking requirements.
      (7)   Pedestrian safe access.
         (a)   Parking lots in excess of 100 spaces shall provide direct and
continuous pedestrian networks within and adjacent to parking areas to connect
building entrances, parking spaces, public sidewalks, transit stops and other
pedestrian destinations.
         (b)   A safe and direct pedestrian pathway must be provided from the
street or sidewalk through the parking area to the primary building entrance.
These pathways must be ADA compliant, and either be completely separated from
vehicular traffic or clearly designated, such as through a raised surface or
distinctive paving.
         (c)   Pedestrian pathways within parking areas that cross driveways
must be clearly marked, such as through a raised surface or distinctive paving.
         (d)   Whenever possible, parking rows should be aligned perpendicular
to the main building, as this provides for a safer and more direct pedestrian
route.
   (L)   Parking area landscaping. The perimeter and interior of parking lots
shall be landscaped pursuant to the requirements in §
152.057(B).
   (M)   Parking area lighting. Off-street parking and loading areas shall
adhere to the lighting requirements in §
152.059.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.057 LANDSCAPE, WALLS, AND SCREENING.
   (A)   Purpose. The landscape, walls, and screening section provides uniform
standards for the installation of landscaping, walls and buffer areas as well
as guidelines for the protection, maintenance and management of these resources
to promote and encourage sustainability, effectuate privacy, facilitate logical
development and enhance property value. This section includes guidance on where
landscaping is required; the types and use of vegetation allowed, the provision
of screening and buffering mechanisms (where necessary) to encourage the
creation of an attractive appearance along public streets while screening
unattractive uses. Landscaping materials, including ground cover, shrubs and
trees, promote the control of erosion and the reduction of glare and dust, as
well as visually softening buildings, parking lots and walls. Walls and
screening devices allow for the separation of incompatible uses and for the
buffering of intensive activities.
   (B)   Landscape. This section is intended to contribute to the aesthetic
character of the town through the provision of landscaping and retention of
existing vegetation.
      (1)   Applicability.  These requirements apply to residential and non-
residential uses except those located in the IP district and single family home
lots. These regulations shall also apply to the required on- and off-site
improvements of a subdivision.
      (2)   Selection of plant materials. Xeriscape landscaping incorporates
water-conserving design through proper plant selection, installation, and
maintenance practices. The species and variety of plants selected to meet the
landscape requirements of this section, shall correspond closely with the
following xeriscape principles:
 
Table 4.3-1: Xeriscape Principles
                                      Careful consideration of a site's size
                                      and shape, soil type, topography, and
                                      building configuration is essential in
                                      developing a good landscape plan. The
                                      function of the space (i.e., its use),
Good Landscape Planning and Design    the amount of available sun, location of
                                      views, regional and microclimate
                                      conditions, and a preliminary assessment
                                      of landscape watering zones should also
                                      be taken into account in early planning
                                      of a xeriscape landscape.
                                      Primarily drought tolerant and low water
                                      use plants shall be used. These plants
                                      can serve nearly every function. Some
Use of Drought Tolerant and Low-Water provide shade and texture, while others
Use Plants                            are appropriate for borders, accent
                                      areas, seasonal color, and year-round
                                      greenery. Native wildflowers and grasses
                                      are typically suitable for revegetating
                                      disturbed areas.
                                      Lawns require a lot of water to stay
                                      green and healthy. Lawns shall only be
                                      located in areas where they provide
                                      functional benefits. Lawn areas planted
Appropriate Lawn Areas                close to a building may provide a cooling
                                      effect. Lawns should not be planted in
                                      odd shaped areas that cannot be watered
                                      efficiently. Lawn areas can often be
                                      planted with modern, low-water-use,
                                      drought-tolerant grasses.
                                      Install irrigation systems so that they
                                      provide an adequate amount of water at
                                      the proper time to the root zone of
                                      plants. Each plant and vegetative type
                                      has its own water needs, and the planting
                                      arrangement and irrigation system should
Efficient Irrigation                  be designed to reflect those needs.
                                      Moisture sensors should be installed on
                                      irrigation controls to measure real time
                                      soil moisture. Each water use zone should
                                      be on a different valve. Additionally,
                                      stormwater runoff should be routed into
                                      each area to offset irrigation needs.
                                      Organic matter should be added to
                                      existing soils to increase water-holding
Soil Improvement                      capacity and provide beneficial nutrients
                                      to plants. In low water-use zones,
                                      loosening the soil may be all that is
                                      needed.
                                      Xeriscape landscapes require low
                                      maintenance, but not no maintenance. To
Appropriate Maintenance               be effective, a xeriscape landscape must
                                      be monitored with a program of pruning,
                                      weed control, pest control, and
                                      irrigation system adjustments.
 
      (3)   Site area landscaping.
         (a)   Any part of a non-residential and multi-family development not
used for buildings, parking, driveways, sidewalks, or natural undisturbed open
space shall be landscaped with vegetation and landscape topping material.
         (b)   Required site area landscape planting criteria. The total
quantity of required landscape materials shall be computed for all site
landscape areas as follows (unless otherwise noted within this chapter):
            1.   Trees. A minimum of one tree shall be required per 500 square
feet of landscape area. All deciduous trees shall not be less than 1½ inches
caliper; all coniferous trees shall not be less than five feet planted height.
            2.   Shrubs. One shrub shall also be required per 100 square feet
of landscape area. All shrubs shall be a minimum of five gallons in size.

      (3)   General wall and fence height standards.
         (a)   Fences or walls located between the front yard building setback
line and the front property line of a lot may not exceed four feet in height.
         (b)   In areas behind a required front yard building setback and
within the required rear and side yards, including walls for single-family
dwellings, the maximum height of walls shall be six feet, as measured from the
finish grade, except where a taller wall is necessary for screening purposes.
Where two lots abut one another, but have differing finish grades, the wall
height shall be limited to six feet on the high side and eight feet on the low
side. Modifications of these requirements shall require written request and
approval of the Community Development Department.
         (c)   Walls exceeding six feet in height, measured from the inside
finished grade, shall require the submittal of structural calculations prepared

in excess of two feet in height (measured from the top of the street curb at
each end of the site triangle) shall be placed on any corner lot within a
triangular area formed by the curb lines and a line connecting them at points
30 feet from the intersection of lines, extended from the back of curbing.
There shall be an exception for any existing trees to remain within the area of
triangle, but shall be pruned to a height of seven feet measured from finished
grade to permit unobstructed visibility for vehicle drivers.
      (4)   Refuse area screens. All trash, rubbish or garbage, including
recyclable materials in common storage areas, except within the IP District,
shall be completely enclosed via a solid six foot wall or fence and view
obstructing gate and located on a concrete surface. Refuse collection areas
shall be readily accessible to collection vehicles, without substantially
encumbering adjacent parking and vehicular access. For multi-family dwellings,
the enclosure shall be softened with landscaping on any side visible from a
public or private street. If the refuse collection area can be seen from the
exterior of a manufactured housing park, the enclosure shall be softened with
landscaping on its most visible sides. For all other uses, if the refuse
collection area can be seen from the front of the property, the enclosure shall
be softened with landscaping on its most visible side.
      (5)   Mechanical equipment screens. All mechanical equipment, either
ground-mounted or located on a rooftop, shall be screened from the view of a
person standing on the property line on the far side of an adjacent public
street. Individual screening of rooftop mechanical equipment is discouraged.
Rooftop units should either be grouped together and screened or screened with a
parapet wall the entire length of the building. Such a parapet wall shall be
designed to be integral to the overall architecture of the building.

         (e)    One sign with one or more sign faces:
            1.    One face.  Area of the single face only.
            2.    Two faces.  If the interior angle between the two faces is 45
degrees or less, the sign area will be the total of one face only; if the angle
between the two sign faces is greater than 45 degrees, the sign area will be
the sum of the areas of the two faces.
            3.   Three or more faces.  The sign area will be calculated as the
sum of the areas of each of the faces.

   (G)   Total aggregate sign area standards. The total aggregate sign area
shall be the sum of all the sign areas of each allowable sign placed on a
parcel with the following restrictions:
      (a)   For all non-residential uses, the total aggregate sign area
allowable to any business having an external business entrance shall not exceed
the greater of 50 square feet or 1½ square feet per lineal foot of building
frontage per business, but in no case more than 300 square feet per business.
      (b)   All non-residential uses having only an external building wall
facing a public street, shall be permitted exterior signage with a total
aggregate sign area not to exceed 50 square feet.
      (c)   Non-residential uses having only an internal business entrance and
no external wall facing a public street or public access driveway or public
alley shall be limited to business identification signage on a multi-tenant
building wall mounted sign as set forth in §
152.058(I)(1)(k).
      (d)   Businesses having building frontage greater than 200 feet in length
may increase their allowed sign area by 0.5 square feet per one lineal foot of
building frontage in excess of 200 feet. Such additional sign area shall be for
the exclusive use of said business and not transferable or reallocable to other
businesses on the parcel.
      (e)   Building frontage is determined by the measurement of the portion
of the business facing the street or public access driveway or public alley.

application form, and any additional information required by the Zoning
Administrator have been provided and accepted as adequate.
            2.   All necessary fees have been paid and accepted.
         (b)   Notification of applicant. If the application is determined to
be complete, the application shall then be processed according to the
procedures set forth in this chapter. If an application is determined to be
incomplete, the Zoning Administrator shall provide written or electronic notice
to the applicant along with an explanation of the application's deficiencies.
No further processing of an incomplete application shall occur until the
deficiencies are corrected in a resubmittal.
         (c)   Expiration of application. If a pending application is not
deemed complete within six months after the first filing with the Community
Development Department, the application shall expire and be deemed withdrawn.
Thirty days prior to that date the planning staff shall notify the applicant in
writing that the application will become inactive. Any refunds of fees shall be
processed according to §
152.086(B)(4).
         (d)   Extension of application. The Zoning Administrator may grant one
six month extension upon written request of the applicant. After expiration of
the application, and extension, if granted, a new application, including
applicable fees, plans, exhibits and other materials will be required to
commence processing of a new project application on the same property.
      (6)   Additional information. After the application has been accepted as
complete, the Zoning Administrator and/or any decision-making body may require
the applicant to submit additional information in order to evaluate fully
whether an application complies with the requirements of this chapter, state,
or federal law.
      (7)   Concurrent applications. When a project requires approvals under
more than one section of the zoning code, the individual applications may be
processed concurrently at the option of the Zoning Administrator and with the
approval of the applicant; provided, however, rezoning applications may not be
approved simultaneously with major general plan amendments. Rezone applications
can only be approved sequentially after major GPA adoption; the rezone
application will be cancelled if the major GPA is not adopted. Minor GPAs may
be processed concurrently with other applications. The concurrent processing of
applications shall be in all cases at the applicant's risk.
      (8)   Referral of application. At the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator, or where otherwise required by this chapter, A.R.S., or federal
law, an application filed in compliance with this chapter may be referred to
any public agency that may be affected by or have an interest in the proposed
land use activity.
   (C)   Citizen review process.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the citizen review process is to provide a
means for the applicant, surrounding residential neighbors, and registered
neighborhood and homeowner's association representatives to review a
preliminary development proposal and solicit input and exchange information
about the proposed development. This citizen review process is intended to
result in an application that is responsive to neighborhood concerns and to
expedite and lessen the expense of the review process by avoiding needless
delays, appeals, remands or denials. The applicant is responsible for all costs
associated with the citizen review process.
      (2)   Applicability.  In accordance with A.R.S. § 9-462.03, all of the
following application types shall conduct a neighborhood meeting, unless as may
be otherwise specified in this section, the town code, or A.R.S.
         (a)   General plan amendments;
         (b)   Zoning text amendments;
         (c)   Zoning map amendments (rezoning);
         (d)   Conditional use permits (optional);
         (e)   Variances (optional); and
         (f)   Major modification to an approved plan or condition of approval
(when original approval requires neighborhood meeting).
      (3)   Meeting schedule. The applicant shall be responsible for scheduling
and facilitating the meeting. The applicant is required to hold one meeting,
prior to the first public hearing on an application for a specific project, but
may hold more if desired. The required meeting shall be held at least 15
calendar days before the first public hearing on the application. Attendance at
the meeting by Community Development Department staff is not required and will
be determined by the Zoning Administrator on a case-by-case basis.
      (4)   Meeting location. Neighborhood meetings shall be held at a location
near the subject property. The meeting shall be held on a weekday evening, or
weekends at any reasonable time and in a publicly accessible location.
      (5)   Notification requirements. Notice of the meeting, which shall state
a brief description of the application and include the date, time, and place of
the meeting, shall be provided by the applicant as follows:
         (a)   Mailing a notice not less than ten calendar days prior to the
date of the neighborhood meeting to:
            1.   All real property owners, as shown on the latest Mohave County
assessment records, within 300 feet of the outer boundary of the subject
property. This notification area may be expanded if the general plan or other
policy adopted by the Town Council requires notification within a larger area
or the Zoning Administrator determines the potential impact of the project
extends beyond the required notification boundary;
            2.   Residents, registered neighborhoods, and homeowners
associations that may be impacted as a result of the application, and other
neighborhood entities identified by the town;
            3.   Interested parties which have requested that they be placed on
a contact list for this application; and
            4.   Potentially interested parties that have been identified by
the town.
      (6)   Meeting summary. The applicant shall submit to the Community
Development Department seven calendar days before the first public hearing on
the matter a written summary of the meeting. The following information shall be
included in the meeting summary, at a minimum: date, time, and location of the
meeting; a copy of the mailing list and meeting sign-in sheet, a summary of how
the applicant has addressed or proposes to address the issues, concerns, and
objections identified during the meeting.
   (D)   Application review and report (substantive review). After determining
that a development application is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall
refer the application to the appropriate review agencies and town staff to
review the submitted materials, and provide written review comments to the
applicant if necessary. Upon receiving the applicant's final response to review
comments, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall prepare a staff report.
The staff report shall be made available for inspection and copying by the
applicant and the public prior to the scheduled public hearing on the
development application. The staff report shall indicate whether, in the
opinion of the staff, the development application complies with all applicable
standards of this chapter. Conditions for approval may be recommended to
eliminate any areas of noncompliance or mitigate any adverse effects of the
development proposal.
   (E)   Public notice requirements. Public notification required under this
chapter, shall be subject to the following requirements, unless as may be
otherwise specified in the town code or as set forth in A.R.S. Any changes to
Arizona Law notice requirements shall have control over this provision in the
manner of providing notice.

noise or accident potential zone as defined in A.R.S. § 28-8461, the notice
shall include a general statement that the matter applies to property located
in the high noise or accident potential zone.
      (3)   Specific notice requirements. Notice as specified in Table 6.2-1,
shall be provided as follows:
         (a)   Published notice.  A public hearing display ad (per A.R.S. § 9-

            1.   The applicant or representative and owners of the subject
property;
            2.   All real property owners, as shown on the latest Mohave County
assessment records, within 300 feet of the outer boundary of the subject
property. This notification area may be expanded if other policy adopted by the
Town Council requires notification within a larger area or the Zoning
Administrator determines the potential impact of the project extends beyond the
required notification boundary;
            3.   Residents, registered neighborhoods, and homeowners
associations that may be impacted as a result of the application, and other
neighborhood entities in the town as determined by the Zoning Administrator;
            4.   Interested parties which have requested that they be placed on

shall be printed so that the following are visible from a distance of 100 feet:
the application type, the application request (i.e. for a zoning map amendment
display the present zoning district classification and the proposed zoning

town shall update the sign as needed and maintain the sign in good condition
throughout the required posting period. The posting shall be removed no later

         (e)   Multiple notices.  When multiple applications are under review
for the same project, the responsible noticing body as specified in this
section may simultaneously issue notice for multiple applications.
         (f)   Validity of notice. The validity of the public hearing
proceedings shall not be affected by the failure of any person to receive
notice or by the presence of minor defects in the notice. Minor defects in
notice shall be limited to errors in a legal description or typographical or
grammatical errors that do not impede communication of the notices' primary
intent to inform affected parties of the project and the time, date, and place
of a public hearing or meeting.
   (F)   Public hearing. A public hearing, if required under this chapter,
shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, unless
as may be otherwise specified by the town or as set forth in A.R.S.
   (G)   Written decision. The decision to approve or approve with conditions

the decision. All decisions shall include a statement of approval, approval
with conditions, or denial, whichever is appropriate.
   (H)   Limitation on reapplication. In the event that an application is
denied, an application that is substantially the same project or request will
not be considered for a period of one year from the date the initial
application was denied, except as follows;
      (1)   A substantial change in circumstances relevant to the issues and/or
facts considered during review of the application that might reasonably affect
the decision-making body's application of the relevant review standards to the
development proposed in the application;
      (2)   A new application is proposed to be submitted that is materially
different (e.g., proposes new uses, or a substantial decrease in proposed
densities and intensities) from the prior application; or
      (3)   The final decision on the application was based on a material
mistake of fact or the foregoing.
   (I)   Reconsideration or rehearing of decisions.
      (1)   Decisions of any appointed body under this chapter may be brought
up for reconsideration or rehearing only if:
         (a)   There was substantial procedural error in the original
proceeding;
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator or body acted without jurisdiction in
the original proceeding;
         (c)   The original decision was based upon fraud or misrepresentation;
         (d)   Reconsideration is appropriate to avoid delay or hardship that
may be caused by an appeal; or
         (e)   As requested by a member of the body whose vote was included in
the side that prevailed in the motion to be reconsidered.
      (2)   Any person seeking reconsideration or a rehearing must file a
request with the Zoning Administrator, together with materials supporting one
or more of the grounds stated in this section, within 15 days of the original
decision, or within the timeframe established under state law if applicable.
The appointed decision-making body, by majority vote, may decide to hold a
rehearing if the rehearing request meets requirements of divisions (I)(a)
through (e) of this section. A rehearing shall be conducted in the same manner
as the original proceedings before the Zoning Administrator or appointed body.
   (J)   Amendments to permits or other forms of approval. An approved
development or new land use shall be established only as specified by the
approved land use permit, and subject to any conditions of approval. An
applicant may request, in writing, to amend the approved permit, and shall
furnish appropriate supporting materials and an explanation of the reasons for
the request.
      (1)   Minor changes may be approved, modified, or denied by the Zoning
Administrator. Major changes shall be approved, modified or denied by the
original review authority.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether a proposed change
is major or minor. The determination that the change is major depends on
whether the proposal may result in:
         (a)   Significant impacts to the surrounding neighborhood;
         (b)   Significant environmental impacts;
         (c)   A change to the approved use or a significant change in
conformance to the original plan or intent; or
         (d)   A change to the basis upon which the review authority made the
findings for approval of the project.
      (3)   A major change request shall be processed in the same manner as the
original permit or entitlement.
   (K)   Appeals. This section sets forth the procedures for appeals except for
appeals filed pursuant to division (L) of this section. Any decision within the
authority of the decision-making body may be appealed, unless the zoning code
provides that the decision is final.
      (1)   Applicability. The appropriate decision-making body for each appeal
type is identified in §§
152.088 through
152.096. General appeals in which it is alleged there is an error in an order,
requirement or decision made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of
this zoning ordinance shall be made to the Board of Adjustment pursuant to the
provisions of this division (K).
      (2)   Appeal process.
         (a)   Filing of appeal.
            1.   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by persons
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality
affected by a decision of the Zoning Administrator. An appeal shall be filed
with the Community Development Department on a form established by the
Director. Within five working days after the appeal is filed, the Zoning
Administrator shall transmit all records pertaining to the action appealed from
to the Board. The appeal shall set forth the decision or decisions being
appealed and the grounds upon which the appeal is based. The appeal shall be
accompanied by any applicable fees.
            2.   A person aggrieved by a decision of the legislative body or
Board of Adjustment or a taxpayer who owns or leases the adjacent property or a
property within 300 from the boundary of the immediately adjacent property, an
officer or a department of the municipality affected by a decision of the
legislative body or Board, may file a complaint for special action in the
superior court to review the legislative body or Board of Adjustment decision.
         (b)   Appeal period. All appeals shall be filed within 15 calendar
days of the decision, except for appeals from decisions of the Board of
Adjustment or Town Council. An appeal from any decision regarding a Town
Council or Board of Adjustment action (e.g., variances, text or map amendments)
shall be filed with the Superior Court within 30 days of the decision. If no
appeal is filed in writing within the relevant 15 or 30-day protest period, the
decision shall be considered final.
         (c)   Proceedings stayed by appeal. The timely filing of an appeal,
except for appeals related to the Zoning Administrator's interpretation or
enforcement of this chapter, shall stay all proceedings in the matter appealed.
            1.   Appeals made to the Board of Adjustment in regard to the
Zoning Administrator's interpretation or enforcement of this chapter shall stay
all proceedings in the matter appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board that, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion by the facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property. Upon such certification, proceedings shall not be stayed, except by
restraining order granted by the Board or by a court of record on application
and notice to the Zoning Administrator.
            2.   Filing a complaint in Superior Court does not stay proceedings
on the decision sought to be reviewed, but the court may, on application, grant
a stay and on final hearing may affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, or
modify the decision reviewed.
         (d)   Public notice. Prior to consideration of any appeal for which
state law or the zoning code requires a public hearing, the town shall provide
public notification in compliance with §
152.089(E) or as required by state law, whichever requires the most notice.
         (e)   Standards. When reviewing any decision on appeal, the decision-
making body shall use the same standards for decision-making required for the
original decision.
         (f)   Hearing body action. Public hearings shall be conducted in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter, unless as may be otherwise
specified in this town code or as set forth in A.R.S. The decision-making body
for the appeal shall deny or grant the appeal or the decision-making body may
remand the matter to the original decision-making body for reconsideration, for
additional information or to cure a deficiency in the record or proceeding. The
decision-making body shall render its decision within 30 days of the date the
hearing is closed unless state law requires a shorter deadline.
   (L)   Appeals of dedications or exactions to hearing officer.
      (1)   Any requirement of a dedication or exaction as a condition of
granting approval for the use, improvement, or development of real property may
be appealed to a hearing officer appointed by the Town Council. This division
shall not apply to legislatively imposed dedications or exactions in which no
discretion by the Zoning Administrator or administrative officer to determine
the nature or extent of the dedication or exaction was exercised. In the event
of such an appeal, the Zoning Administrator shall prepare a takings impact
report. No fee shall be charged for filing an appeal under this section and
such appeal shall be conducted as required by A.R.S. § 9-500.12.
      (2)   Appeal of decision of zoning hearing officer. A property owner
aggrieved by a decision of the zoning hearing officer to modify or affirm a
dedication or exaction requirement or to affirm a zoning regulation may file
within 30 days after the decision a complaint in Superior Court, pursuant to
A.R.S § 9-500.12G.
   (M)   Effective date and exercising approval at risk.
      (1)   A final decision on an application for any discretionary approval
subject to appeal (e.g., a conditional use permit, variance, or site plan
approval) shall become effective after the expiration of the appeal period
following the date of action, unless an appeal is filed. No building permit or
business registration shall be issued until the day following the expiration of
the appeal period, unless, in accordance with division (M)(2) below, the
applicant signs a waiver explaining that they understand and accept the risk of
proceeding before the appeal period ends.
      (2)   An approved conditional use permit or variance or an interpretation
favorable to the applicant may be exercised at the applicant's sole risk, and a
building permit (if required) may be issued subsequent to approval by the town
Building Official. However, if an appeal of the decision is filed in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter that reverses in whole or in part or
modifies the decision and that causes any construction or use commenced as a
result of exercising the decision to be in conflict with the appellate body's
decision, then such building permit may be revoked in accordance with the
appellate body's decision and any such construction or use may constitute a
violation of this chapter and may be subject to removal or cessation by the
applicant, property owner, or his or her agent.

community as a whole or a portion of the community by:
         (a)   Significantly altering acceptable existing land use patterns;

sewer, or water systems than are needed to support the prevailing land uses in
which, therefore, may negatively impact development of other lands. The
Commission and/or the Town Council may also consider the degree to which the
need for such improvements will be mitigated pursuant to binding commitments by
the applicant, a public agency, or other sources when the impacts of the uses
permitted pursuant to the general plan amendment will be felt;

plan adoption that did not fully consider facts, projects or trends which could
reasonably exist in the future;
      (6)   Whether events subsequent to the general plan adoption have
superseded the original premises and findings made upon plan adoption;
      (7)   Whether events subsequent to the general plan adoption may have

of the impacts identified in divisions (E)(1) through (8) hereto.
   (F)   Appeal. An appeal from any final decision regarding a Town Council

If no appeal is filed in writing within 30 days, the decision shall be

      (2)   Application review and decision. Upon receipt of a complete
temporary use permit application, the Zoning Administrator shall review the
proposed temporary use permit application and distribute the application to
other reviewers as he or she deems necessary. Based on the results of those
reviews, the Zoning Administrator shall take final action on the application

   (D)   Required findings. The Zoning Administrator may approve a temporary
use permit as submitted or modified only upon making the following findings:

of possible future land uses otherwise allowed by this code.
   (E)   Appeal. Decisions of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the
Board of Adjustment pursuant to the procedures set forth in §
152.086(K).
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.093 VARIANCE.
   (A)   Purpose and applicability. Because of special circumstances applicable
to a property, including its size, shape, topography, location or surroundings,
there may be instances in which the strict application of the zoning ordinance
will deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the same
zoning district. To ensure a fair application of this chapter, a variance from
the standards imposed may be granted by the Board of Adjustment. In granting a
variance:
      (1)   Consideration may be given with respect to dimensional and
performance standards including, but not limited to site dimensions, yards,
height of structures, distances between structures, open space requirements,
signage dimensions, fences, and walls.
      (2)   Nothing shall be construed to empower the Board to change the terms
of this chapter, to authorize uses which violate any other town ordinance, to
affect changes in the zoning map, to add to the uses permitted or adjust the
permitted density in any zoning district, or to grant a conditional use permit.
      (3)   All sections of this code are considered binding unless relief is
granted through the variance process.
      (4)   All shall be personal to the appellant and shall be transferable
and run with the land only after completion and final inspection of any
authorized structure.
   (B)   Variance application process.

      (1)   Pre-application conference. Prior to the submission of an
application for a variance, all applicants are required to schedule a meeting
with the Zoning Administrator, as set forth in §
152.086(A).
      (2)   Application submittal. A complete application for a variance shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator as required by §
152.086(B). At minimum a variance application shall include:

         (b)   A written statement indicating the variance will meet the
requirements listed in §
152.093(C);
         (c)   A site plan showing the footprint and proposed use of all
buildings proposed, parking configuration and other details necessary to
demonstrate that the proposed use and site conforms with all other requirements
of the zoning district and variance requirements; and
         (d)   The applicant shall submit any other information identified in
the pre-application meeting and all required information stated elsewhere in
this code for a variance.
      (3)   Citizen review process.

meeting, however for certain variance requests staff shall have the option to
require the applicant to schedule and conduct a neighborhood meeting to avoid
any unnecessary delays during the public hearing process.
         (b)   If the applicant chooses to hold or is required to hold a
neighborhood meeting it shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures
set forth in §
152.086(C).
      (4)   Application review and report. Upon receipt of a complete variance
application, the Zoning Administrator shall review the proposed variance for
compliance with criteria enumerated in §

transmittal to the Board of adjustment.
      (5)   Notification. Public notification shall be provided in compliance
with §
152.086(E).
      (6)   Board of Adjustment review and action.
         (a)   The Board of Adjustment shall review the application in a public
hearing and may approve, approve with modifications and/or conditions, or deny
the variance.
         (b)   Conditions of approval. In approving a variance, the Board of
Adjustment may impose reasonable conditions necessary to:
            1.   Achieve the general purposes of the zoning code or the
specific purposes of the zoning district in which the site is located, or to
make it consistent with the general plan;
            2.   Protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; or
            3.   Insure operation and maintenance of the use in a manner
compatible with existing and potential uses on adjoining properties or in the
surrounding area.
      (7)   Written notification. The decision to approve or approve with
conditions or deny shall be communicated in writing to the applicant in
compliance with §
152.086(G).
   (C)   Required findings. The Board of Adjustment shall only approve a
variance after finding that all of the following conditions are met. Financial
hardship, personal preference of the owner, or the fact that property may be
utilized more profitably if the requested variance is granted shall not be
considered grounds for a variance.
      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district.
      (2)   A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the
appellant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning
district.
      (3)   The alleged hardship caused by literal interpretation of the
provisions of this chapter includes more than personal inconvenience and
financial hardship and is not the result of actions by the appellant.
      (4)   Granting the variance will not confer upon the appellant any
special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures, or
buildings in the same zoning district.
      (5)   Granting the variance will not interfere with or substantially
injure the appropriate use of adjacent conforming properties in the same zoning
district.
      (6)   The reasons set forth in the appeal justify the granting of the
variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible
the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
      (7)   Granting the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.    
      (8)   No variance shall be granted from any written conditions attached
by another decision-maker to the approval of a rezoning, conditional use
permit, subdivision plat, or site plan.
      (9)   No variance shall be granted if the conditions or circumstances
affecting the applicant's property are of so general or recurrent a nature as
to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
conditions or situations.
      (10)   No non-conforming use or violations of this chapter with respect
to neighboring lands, structures or buildings, in the same zoning district, and
no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other zoning districts,
shall be considered grounds for granting a variance.
      (11)   Every decision of the Board shall be based upon findings of fact,
and every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of its proceedings.
The conditions required by this chapter to exist on any matter upon which the
Board is authorized to pass under this chapter shall be construed as
limitations on the power of the Board to act. A mere finding or recitation of
the enumerated conditions, unaccompanied by findings of specific fact, shall
not be deemed findings of fact, and shall not be deemed in compliance with this
chapter.
   (D)   Expiration and time extensions.
      (1)   Expiration. In any case where a variance has not been used within
one year after the granting, it shall become null and void.
      (2)   Time extensions. The Board of Adjustment shall hold a public
hearing to consider the granting of a time extension of no more than one
additional year as follows:
         (a)   Upon request by the applicant;
         (b)   When the request is filed in writing with the Community
Development Department not less than 30 days prior to the expiration date of
the original variance approval;
         (c)   When accompanied by a time extension fee in accordance with the
fee schedule of the town; or
         (d)   Upon determination by the Board that there have been no changes
in the circumstances or in the vicinity of the property or use which would
render the previously approved variance inappropriate.
   (E)   Revocation.
      (1)   Revocation. The Board of Adjustment shall be authorized to hold a
public hearing to consider the revocation of a variance previously granted in
accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance. A written notice of the
date, time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be served on the owner of
the property for which the variance was granted by registered mail, return
receipt requested, not less than 30 days prior to the date of such hearing.
      (2)   Findings.  A variance may be revoked if, from the facts presented
at the public hearing or by investigation, the Board makes an affirmative
determination on any one of the following findings:
         (a)   That the variance was obtained by fraud; or
         (b)   That the variance granted is being exercised contrary to the
conditions of approval of such variance or in violation of any applicable law,
license, ordinance, permit or regulation.
   (F)   Appeals. An appeal from any final decision regarding a Board action
shall be filed with Superior Court within 30 days of the decision. If no appeal
is filed in writing within 30 days, the decision shall be considered final.

denying a permit or authorization (as described in division (A), above) the
town may grant such authorization subject to the condition that the violation
be corrected.
   (C)   Revoke entitlements.
      (1)   Any development permit or other form of authorization required

      (2)   Written notice of such revocation shall be served upon the owner,
the owner's agent or contract, or upon any person employed on the building or

may stop work on any building or structure on any land on which there is an
uncorrected violation of a provision of this chapter or of a permit or other
form of authorization issued hereunder, in accordance with the town's power to
stop work under its building codes. A stop-work procedure is as follows:
      (1)   The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed both to the
permit holder and the person doing the work, and shall specify the provisions
of this code or other law allegedly in violation. After any such order has been
served, no work shall proceed on any building, structure, or tract of land
covered by such order, except to correct such violation or comply with the
order.
      (2)   Once conditions for resumption of the work have been met, the
Zoning Administrator shall rescind the stop-work order.
   (E)   Abatement. The town may commence an action to abate a violation of the
zoning code pursuant to A.R.S § 9-499.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 152.120 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and restrict uses,
structures, lots, site characteristics, and signs that were established legally
prior to the adoption or amendment of this code but do not conform to the
requirements of this code. All such situations are collectively referred to in
this chapter as "nonconformities."
   (B)   It is the intent of this section to encourage the continuing
improvement of the town by limiting the extent to which nonconforming
structures and uses may continue to be used, expanded, or replaced, while
allowing for improvements in their appearance.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.121 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Authority to continue. Any nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use of a conforming structure that lawfully existed as of the
passage of this code and that remains nonconforming, and any nonconformity that
is created as a result of the adoption of this code or any subsequent amendment
to the text of this code, may be continued or maintained as a legal
nonconformity only in accordance with the terms of this section.
   (B)   Determination of nonconformance status. The town shall have the burden
to show that a nonconforming structure, lot or use was unlawfully established
prior to the effective date of this code.
   (C)   Change of ownership or tenancy. Changes of ownership, tenancy, or
management of property with an existing nonconformity may occur, but such
nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this section.
   (D)   Maintenance and minor repair. Minor repairs or maintenance of
nonconformities are permitted, provided that the minor repairs and maintenance
do not increase the extent of nonconformity. For purposes of this section,
MAINTENANCE OR MINOR REPAIR shall mean:
      (1)   Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or
deterioration to the structural soundness or exterior or interior appearance of
a building or structure without expanding the building or structure;
      (2)   Maintenance of land areas to protect against health and
environmental hazards; and
      (3)   Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a
threat to public safety.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.122 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Expansion, enlargement and modification. Any nonconforming use of land
or a nonconforming use of a conforming structure that is not in compliance with
this code shall not be enlarged, extended, moved, or substituted unless the use
is brought into compliance with this code. However, reasonable repairs and
alterations are permissible in accordance with the provisions of §
152.121(D).
   (B)   Change of use.
      (1)   Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use and once
such change is made, the use shall not thereafter be changed back to a
nonconforming use. A change to a conforming use shall also not create any
additional nonconforming situations.
      (2)   Where a conforming use is located in a nonconforming structure, the
use may be changed to another conforming use by securing a certificate of
occupancy.
   (C)   Loss of nonconforming status. If a nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use of a conforming structure is discontinued for a continuous
period of six months, the rights to a legal nonconforming status shall
terminate. The initial decision as to whether a prior existing, non-conforming
use has been abandoned shall be made by the Zoning Administrator, subject to
said decision being appealed to the Board of Adjustment by the affected
property owner within three months of the ruling by the Zoning Administrator
following the procedures under §
152.086(K).
   (D)   Conditional uses. A use that received a conditional use permit prior
to the effective date of this code and that is permitted in its entirety as a
principal use in the district in which it is located under this code shall not
be deemed a nonconforming use. Such use shall be deemed a permitted principal
use and the Conditional Use approval and conditions of approval relative to the
use shall be null and void.

is created as a result of the adoption of this code or any subsequent amendment
to the text of this code, may be continued or maintained as a nonconformity
only in accordance with the terms of this section.
   (B)   Expansion, enlargement and modification. No nonconforming structure
may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, unless
expansion or alteration of a nonconforming structure complies with development
standards of the zoning district in which it is located, including but not
limited to, setbacks applicable to the use for new construction, parking
regulations and landscaping and screening requirements of this code, and all
other applicable codes and ordinances of the town.
   (C)   Destruction and replacement. Any nonconforming structure when damaged
or destroyed by force majeure, may be restored without impairment to any
nonconforming status, provided:
      (1)   If more than 50% of the current assessed value of any nonconforming
structure is destroyed, it shall not be reconstructed unless it is made to
conform to the requirements of this code.
      (2)   If less than 50% of the current assessed value of any nonconforming
structure is destroyed, it may be reconstructed as long as a building permit is
submitted within 90 days after the date of destruction, provided the resulting
structure complies with current building codes and the size and function of the
nonconforming use shall not be expanded. Upon written request, the Zoning
Administrator may grant a one-time extension for the submittal of a building
permit application.
      (3)   An appraisal, paid for by the owner, shall determine the above
assessed value. The appraisal must be done by an appraiser who has an appraiser
license/certification from the state.

conforms in use, location, height or size with the regulations of this section,
may be continued or maintained as a nonconformity only in accordance with the
terms of this section.
   (B)   Expansion, enlargement and modification. No nonconforming sign may be
enlarged, altered or modified in a way that increases its nonconformity, unless
such change is a reasonable alteration, repair, or maintenance as determined by
the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Loss of nonconforming status.
      (1)   The sign may continue in use until such time as it is removed, or
abandoned for a period of two or more continuous months.

provisions of the code, or the A.R.S., the Zoning Administrator shall determine
the most appropriate definition in compliance with §
152.136(H).
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)

or photograph, the text shall control.
   (C)   Lists and examples. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, lists of
items or examples that use terms such as “for example,” “including,” and “such
as,” or similar language are intended to provide examples and are not
exhaustive lists of all possibilities.
   (D)   Computation of time. If a deadline or required date of action falls on
a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday observed by the town, the deadline or required
date of action shall be the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
observed by the town. References to days are calendar days unless otherwise

construed as a reference to the most recent edition of such regulation,
resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or document, unless otherwise
specifically stated.
   (F)   Mandatory and discretionary terms. The words "shall," "must," and
"will" are mandatory in nature, establishing an obligation or duty to comply
with the particular provision. The words "may" and "should" are permissive in
nature.
   (G)   Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly suggests the contrary,
conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows: “And” indicates that all
connected items, conditions, provisions or events apply; and “Or” indicates
that one or more of the connected items, conditions, provisions, or events
apply.
   (H)   Interpretations. The Zoning Administrator has final authority to
determine the interpretation or usage of terms used in this development code.
Any person may request an interpretation of any term by submitting a written
request to the Administrator, who shall respond in writing within 30 days. The
Community Development Department shall keep a public record of all
interpretations and determinations on usage of terms rendered by the
Administrator.
      (1)   Use interpretation. If an application is submitted for a use type
not listed in the Use Tables, §§
152.025 through
152.033, the Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to make a “Similar Use
Interpretation,” based on the following considerations:
         (a)   The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in
relationship to the stated characteristics of each use type;
         (b)   The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment
devoted to the activity;
         (c)   Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
         (d)   The customer type for each activity;
         (e)   The relative number of employees in each activity;
         (f)   Hours of operation;
         (g)   Building and site arrangement;
         (h)   Vehicles used with the activity;
         (i)   The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; and
         (j)   How the use advertises itself.
      (2)   Use interpretation standards.
         (a)   No similar use interpretation shall allow a use in a zoning
district when that use is a permitted or conditional use in any other zoning
district.
         (b)   No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning
district unless evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply
with all applicable use standards and all other applicable requirements and
standards of this code.
         (c)   No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning
district unless the use is more similar to the uses listed for the respective
zone than to permitted or conditional uses allowed in other zoning districts.
         (d)   If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a
conditional use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located,
then any similar use interpretation permitting that use shall require a
conditional use permit.
      (3)   Effect of similar use interpretation. No similar use interpretation
finding a particular use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a
specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required
by the codes and ordinances of the town or other governmental agencies having
jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to
conditional use permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.
(Ord. 2020-02, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 152.137 SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of carrying out the intent of this code, unless the content
clearly indicates to the contrary, the following words, phrases, and terms
shall have the following meanings:
   (A)   Basis for use categories. Use categories classify land uses and
activities into categories based on common functional, product, or physical
characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the
type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and
site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for organizing
and assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts.
   (B)   Specific use type. Specific uses are assigned to the category that
most closely describes the nature of the specific use. Specific uses shall be
considered based on common characteristics and not on what a specific use may
call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "Wholesale Warehouse" but
that sells clothing to the general consumer on a small scale is included in the
"Retail, General" use rather than the "Wholesale Establishment" use. This is
because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the Retail,
General use.
   (C)   Developments with multiple specific uses. When all principal uses of a
development fall within one specific use, the entire development is assigned to
that use. A development that contains a clothing boutique, bookstore and
bakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail, General use type
because all of the development's specific uses are in that use. When the
specific uses of a development fall within different use types, each use is
classified in the applicable use and each use is subject to all applicable
regulations for that specific use.
      ABANDONED.  Any building, structure or real property that is vacant or
occupied by a person without a legal right of occupancy, and/or subject to a
current notice of default and/or notice of trustee's sale, pending tax
assessor's lien sale and/or any real property conveyed via a foreclosure sale
resulting in the acquisition of title by an interested beneficiary of a deed of
trust, and/or any real property conveyed via a deed in lieu of foreclosure/
sale.
      ABUT, ABUTTING. To share, border or physically touch a common boundary,
property line or right-of-way.
      ACCESS. The place, means or ways by which pedestrians, vehicles or both
shall have safe, adequate and usable ingress and egress to a property or use. A
private access is an access not in public ownership and controlled by means of
a deed, dedication or easement.
      ACCESSIBLE PARKING SPACE. A parking space that meets the requirements of
applicable state and federal disabilities acts.
      ACCESSORY BUILDING. A secondary detached building situated on the same

§ 153.003 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   General. By authority of the Colorado City Town Council adopted
pursuant to powers and jurisdictions vested through A.R.S. § 9-463.01
pertaining to subdivision of lands within incorporated areas, and other
applicable laws, statutes, orders and regulations of the State of Arizona, and
the Town of Colorado City, the Town Council does hereby exercise the power and
authority to review and approve or disapprove, based upon recommendation of the
Town of Colorado City Planning and Zoning Commission and its Director, plats
for division of land within the town. The Town Council may, in the exercise of
its police power or for purposes previously identified, amend, add to, delete
or change this Land Division Ordinance.
   (B)   Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of
land, as detailed herein, located within the Town of Colorado City. No land

survey/plat is filed with and recorded by the Mohave County Recorder's Office.
   (C)   Water adequacy. The subdivider must demonstrate an adequate water
supply to the satisfaction of the Town of Colorado City as required by state
statute under A.R.S. § 9-463.01.

parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision
regulations. The town may declare a moratorium on construction and require
compliance with these regulations and take whatever steps necessary to ensure
compliance.
   (E)   Public conflict. The regulations are not intended to interfere with,
abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other

regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more
restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.
   (F)   Private conflict. These regulations are not intended to abrogate any
easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided that
where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher
standards or regulations than the easement, covenant or other private agreement
or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
   (G)   Severability. If any part or provisions of these regulations or
application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, that judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision or application directly involved in the
controversy in which the judgment shall have been rendered, and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances.
   (H)   Conditions. Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment
of reasonable conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police
power delegated by the State of Arizona to its political subdivisions. The
subdivider has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by
the Town Council for design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of the
land so as to conform to the physical and economical development of the
municipality and to protect the safety and general welfare of the future lot
owners of the subdivision and the community at large.

§ 153.065 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Minor or material amendments.
      (1)   Subdivision plat proposals may be amended during the course of plat
review. The process for amendment depends on whether the change is determined
to be major or minor in scope, and at what stage the change is being proposed
(preliminary plat, final plat, or recordation).
      (2)   A determination will be made by the Planning and Zoning Director
upon receipt of comments from reviewing town departments whether the changes
are "minor authorized" changes and the final plat may be presented to the Town
Council or if the changes are material and a "revised" preliminary plat will be
required for consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Town
Council.
      (3)   Minor authorized changes may include adjustment, variation and
reduction of lots, lot lines, easements or statements contained in the
preliminary plat if they are found by the Planning and Zoning Director to be
consistent with the intent and design of the approved preliminary plat.
      (4)   Adding lots, streets or creating exceptions to the town's design
standards are changes which will require a "revised" preliminary plat.
   (B)   Amendments between preliminary plat and before final plat. Any minor
amendment proposed following Commission approval of the preliminary plat will
be highlighted for consideration by the Town Council as part of the final plat
application. Major amendments to the preliminary plat shall be returned to the
Commission for further consideration.
   (C)   Amendments following approval of final plat and before recording. The
Planning and Zoning Director may administratively approve any minor amendment
(i.e., change of street names, decrease in the number of lots, nominal
increases or decreases of lot sizes; nominal changes in the location of
streets, easements, and other public rights-of-way), to a final plat which has
already been approved by the Town Council. Any major amendment to a final plat
which follows Council approval will be referred back to the Town Council.
   (D)   Amendments which follow recording. Any plat of a subdivision that has
been filed for record with the Mohave County Recorder may be amended to correct
an error in any course or distance or other necessary item that was omitted
therefrom, or to correct a drafting, graphic, technical or similar type errors,
determined to be minor in scope by either the Planning and Zoning Director or a
representative Committee delegated to evaluate the amendment proposals
(scrivener's errors), and the corrected and amended plat may be subsequently
recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Director shall examine the amended plat,
and if the examination discloses that the only changes on the amended plat are
changes authorized above, he or she shall certify this to be a fact over his or
her signature on the amended plat. Thereafter, the amended plat shall be
entitled to be recorded in the office of the Mohave County Recorder in which
the original map was recorded. The map shall be marked "Amended Map of (insert
name of subdivision) ."   
      (2)   For any change in a recorded subdivision plat which exceeds the
criteria noted above, that change shall require approval of the Town Council.

§ 153.066 REVERSION TO ACREAGE/PLAT OF ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   (1)   Streets, alleys, rights-of-way, easements, reserve strips or
other public use ways or facilities may be abandoned by the Town Council
pursuant to the provisions of this section.
      (2)   If none of the improvements have been made in accordance with the
assurance for completion of improvements, the Town Council may on its own
motion hold a public hearing after notice and conditions outlined herein, to
determine whether the approval of the final plat should be revoked. The
revocation shall be effective upon recordation of a certified copy of the
resolutions.
   (B)   In order to initiate an abandonment proceeding for all or a portion of
a recorded subdivision or a public road, an application for abandonment must be
filed with the Planning and Zoning Director. If the abandonment is proposed by
a private citizen, a preliminary title report shall be submitted by the
property owner(s) for the property proposed to be abandoned or reverted to
acreage. The application fee shall be paid by the applicant at the time of
filing.
   (C)   (1)   Upon receipt of the application, the Planning and Zoning
Director shall conduct an investigation and shall distribute the request to
reviewing agencies for comment including but not limited to the Town Public
Works Department, Town Engineer, County Assessor, local fire district,
emergency service agencies and municipalities within 3 miles of the
subdivision, County Treasurer and/or other agencies as deemed appropriate by
the Director. Reviewing agencies shall have 25 working days, from the date the
abandonment application was received by the Planning and Zoning Department, to
complete their comments pertaining to the proposed abandonment. No reply by an
agency within the time limit specified shall be deemed as having received no
objections from that agency to approval of the abandonment. Upon receipt of the
reviewing agency comment(s), if any, the Director shall prepare a report for
presentation to the Town Council at a duly noticed public hearing.
      (2)   The application may necessitate consideration for re-zoning if the
Council deems it necessary or desirable.
   (D)   Within 60 days of receipt of an abandonment application, the Council
shall conduct a duly noticed public hearing. Upon completion of the hearing,
the Council shall approve, approve in modified form, or deny the application as
well as indicate whether or not zoning changes should accompany any action for
abandonment. Any action to recommend approval of abandonment shall be based
upon the following findings:
      (1)   That the abandonment is in the interests of the general welfare of
the town and is in correlation with the General Plan;
      (2)   That the abandonment would not prohibit or unduly inhibit access by
the public-at-large, nearby property owners and public utilities with proposed
development in adjacent areas; and
      (3)   That the abandonment would not eliminate public access ways which
may be presently in use or desirable for future use.
   (E)   Upon Town Council approval of an abandonment application, the
applicant shall prepare the proper abandonment documents and plat, including
any required deeds of conveyance, and submit them, along with the recording
fee, to the Planning and Zoning Director for review, approval and recording.
The abandonment shall be effective when recorded by the town along with the
abandonment resolution of the Town Council in compliance with Arizona Revised
Statutes.
   (F)   Whenever an abandonment action is approved for publicly owned rights-
of-way, the rights-of-way shall vest in the abutting property to the center
line of the right-of-way. Zoning for abandoned rights-of-way shall be the same
as the properties to which they are conveyed. Rights-of-way or easements for
existing sewer, gas, water, irrigation or similar pipelines and appurtenances,
and for canals, laterals or ditches and appurtenances, and for electric,
telephone, cable television and similar cables and lines and appurtenances,
shall continue as they existed prior to the abandonment. The applicant shall
provide easement plats and descriptions as required for any utility facility
remaining in place and for recording the easement documents with the Mohave
County Recorder.

of street improvements.
   (B)   The Town Engineer will perform periodic inspections throughout the
course of construction, including the subgrade base prior to the placement of
overlaying materials. These inspections or interim approvals do not signify
that the town has accepted any of the improvements for maintenance. The
subdivider's engineer shall submit monthly progress reports to the Town
Engineer throughout the progress of the construction and shall include the
results of all tests taken during the month.
   (C)   At the completion of the work, or not less than 30 days prior to the
release date of the bond or other assurance, the engineer of record shall make
an inspection of the improvements and shall submit a set of “as-built”
construction plans if complete or a report on the status of improvements, along
with a punch list of uncompleted items, if the improvements are only partially
complete, to the Town Engineer. The Town Engineer will perform a final
inspection after the installation of survey monumentation and will review the
as-built plans and/or report and notify the subdivider of any noncompliance
with the approved construction plans or with these regulations. As-built
construction plans shall include 1 set of mylars, a digital copy, in a format
determined by the Planning and Zoning Director and 2 sets of copies, along with

submit a report to the Town Council, setting forth the conditions of the
facilities with a recommendation for acceptance of the constructed
improvements.
   (D)   The warranty period begins on the day that the Town Council accepts
the public improvements. A warranty period of 2 years for all utilities and 1
year for roadway pavement and structures shall apply to all subdivision
improvements; however the warranty period may extend beyond that time period as
determined by the Town Engineer based on the test results, the engineer’s
report, the inspection records, and his or her professional opinion. During the
warranty period the subdivider is responsible for repair work to any of the
public improvements as may be required by the Town Engineer. The Town Engineer
will periodically inspect the public improvements and will notify the
subdivider of the necessary repair work. The subdivider is responsible for
having the repair work completed prior to the end of the warranty period. Upon
completion of the warranty period and acceptable repair of any necessary
warranty items, the remainder of the financial assurances retained by the town
will be released.
   (E)   The certification below shall be sealed by the engineer of record,
duly registered in the State of Arizona, on the as-built plans. Plans must be
approved by the Town Engineer and presented to the Town Council prior to the
surety release. If all conditions are found to be satisfactory and the
improvements comply with town standards, the Town Council shall release the
surety. If the condition of materials and/or workmanship does not comply with
town standards or the approved construction plans, the Town Engineer will
present this information to the Town Council who may declare the subdivider in
default. The certification statement shall read as follows:
      In my professional opinion, the construction of [the specific site
improvements required for approval] has been completed in substantial
conformance with the construction plans and specifications including authorized
changes and addendums. My professional opinion is based, in part, upon
observation of the construction work and the completion of certain tests and
measurements and/or the review of the results of such tests and measurements
completed by others.

LAND SPLITS
§ 153.115 PURPOSE.
   Land splits.  Provide for the division of land of 2.5 acres or less into 2
or 3 parcels through a process that is more expeditious than the subdivision
process; maintains accurate records of maps created to divide existing parcels
or lots; ensures adequate legal access to lots or parcels; and ensures that
land splits do not constitute a subdivision. Certain basic improvements and
design standards may be necessary and desirable in order to ensure proper
development of an area experiencing an increase in density. These provisions
are necessary to prevent circumventing the intent and spirit of these land
division regulations and to ensure responsible development.

public services that will be generated by an ERU can be reasonably quantified
in terms of the burden it will impose on the available capacity of existing
capital facilities, the need it will create for new or expanded capital
facilities, and/or the benefit to the development from those capital
facilities.
   USEFUL LIFE. The period of time in which an asset can reasonably be expected
to be used under normal conditions, whether or not the asset will continue to
be owned and operated by the town over the entirety of such period.
   VEHICLE. Any device, structure, or conveyance utilized for transportation in
the course of providing a particular category of necessary public services at a
specified level of service, excluding helicopters and other aircraft.

§ 154.04 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the effective
date, this chapter shall apply to all new development within any service area,
except for the development of any town facility.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all of the territory
within the corporate limits of Colorado City and/or within the town's utility
service areas.
   (C)   The Town Manager or his or her designee is authorized to make
determinations regarding the application, administration and enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   The impact fees authorized hereby are separate from and in addition to

fees and costs that may not be included as itemized component parts of the
impact fee.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.05 AUTHORITY FOR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Impact fee analysis and implementation. The town may assess and
collect a development impact fee for costs of necessary public services,
including all professional services required for the preparation or revision of
an Infrastructure Improvements Plan, impact fee analysis, development impact
fee, and required reports or audits conducted pursuant to this chapter.
Development impact fees shall be subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   The town shall develop and adopt an impact fee analysis that
analyzes and defines the development impact fees to be charged in each service
area for each capital facility category, based on the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and the plan-based cost per ERU calculated pursuant to §
154.08(A)(12).
      (2)   Development impact fees shall be assessed against all new
commercial, residential, and industrial developments, provided that the town
may assess different amounts of development impact fees against specific
categories of development based on the actual burdens and costs that are
associated with providing necessary public services to that category of
development. No development impact fee shall exceed the plan-based cost per ERU
for any category of development.
      (3)   No development impact fees shall be charged, or credits issued, for
any capital facility that does not fall within 1 of the categories of necessary
public services for which development impact fees may be assessed as identified
in §
154.08(A)(1).
      (4)   Costs for necessary public services made necessary by new
development shall be based on the same level of service provided to existing
development in the same service area. Development impact fees may not be used
to provide a higher level of service to existing development or to meet
stricter safety, efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory standards to
the extent that these are applied to existing capital facilities that are
serving existing development.
      (5)   Development impact fees may not be used to pay the town's
administrative, maintenance, or other operating costs.
      (6)   Projected interest charges and financing costs can only be included
in development impact fees to the extent they represent principal and/or
interest on the portion of any financing or debt used to finance the
construction or expansion of a capital facility identified in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (7)   Except for any fees included on interim fee schedules, all
development impact fees charged by the town must be included in a "fee
schedule" prepared pursuant to this chapter and included in the impact fee
analysis; example versions of all fee schedules are provided in Appendix A. All
development impact fees shall meet the requirements of A.R.S. § 9-463.05.
   (B)   Costs per ERU. The impact fee analysis shall summarize the costs of
capital facilities necessary to serve new development on a per ERU basis as
defined and calculated in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, including all
required offsets, and shall recommend a development impact fee structure for
adoption by the town. The actual impact fees to be assessed shall be disclosed
and adopted in the form of impact fee schedules described in Appendix A to this
chapter.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.06 ADMINISTRATION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Separate accounts. Development impact fees collected pursuant to this
chapter shall be placed in separate, interest-bearing ledger accounts for each
capital facility category within each service area.
   (B)   Limitations on use of fees. Development impact fees and any interest
thereon collected pursuant to this chapter shall be spent to provide capital
facilities associated with the same category of necessary public services in
the same service area for which they were collected, including costs of
financing or debt used by the town to finance such capital facilities and other
costs authorized by this chapter that are included in the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan.
   (C)   Time limit. Development impact fees collected shall be used within 10
years of the date upon which they were collected for all categories of
necessary public services except for water and wastewater facilities. For water
facilities or wastewater facilities collected after July 31, 2014, development
impact fees must be used within 15 years of the date upon which they were
collected.
   (D)   Annual report. In addition to the report identified in §
154.15, at the end of each fiscal year, the city shall prepare a report on each
fund or ledger account. The report shall show:
      (1)   The source and amount of all money collected, earned, and received
by the fund or ledger account; and
      (2)   Each expenditure from the fund or ledger account.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.08 INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS PLAN.
   (A)   Infrastructure Improvements Plan contents. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall be developed by qualified professionals and may be
based upon or incorporated within the town's Capital Improvements Plan. The
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall:
      (1)   Specify the categories of necessary public services for which the
town will impose a development impact fee, which may include any or all of the
following:
         (a)   Water.
         (b)   Wastewater.
         (c)   Stormwater, drainage, and flood control.
         (d)   Street facilities.
         (e)   Fire protection.
         (f)   Police.
         (g)   Parks.
      (2)   Define and provide a map of 1 or more service areas within which
the town will provide each category of necessary public services for which
development impact fees will be charged. Each service area must be defined in a
manner that demonstrates a substantial nexus between the capital facilities to
be provided in the service area and the ERUs to be served by those capital
facilities.
      (3)   Identify and describe the land use assumptions upon which the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based in each service area.
      (4)   Analyze and identify the existing level of service provided by the
town to existing ERUs for each category of necessary public services in each
service area.
      (5)   Identify the level of service to be provided by the town for each
category of necessary public services in each service area based on the
relevant land use assumptions and any established town
standards or policies related to required levels of service. If the town
provides the same category of necessary public services in more than 1 service
area, the Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall include a comparison of the
levels of service to be provided in each service area.
      (6)   Identify any grandfathered facilities and the impact thereof on the
need for necessary public services in each affected service area.
      (7)   Estimate the total number of existing and future ERUs within each
service area based on the town's land use assumptions and projected new ERUs in
each service area.
      (8)   For each category of necessary public services, analyze and
identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing
capital facilities, and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be
required to provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service
area as a result of the new projected ERUs in that service area, for a period
not to exceed 10 years. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the town from
additionally including in its Infrastructure Improvements Plan projected
utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer than 10
years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded from the
calculation of the plan-based cost per ERU.
      (9)   For each category of necessary public services, estimate the total
cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital facilities
that will be required to serve new ERUs, including costs of land acquisition,
improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to
design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs, as well as
projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include costs for
ongoing operation and maintenance of capital facilities, nor for replacement of
capital facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve
existing ERUs. If the Infrastructure Improvements Plan includes changes or
upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or
maintain the planned level of service to existing ERUs, or to meet new
regulatory requirements for services provided to existing ERUs, such costs
shall be identified and distinguished in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (10)   Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other
sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities
identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall additionally estimate the time required to finance,
construct and implement the new or expanded capital facilities.
   (B)   Multiple Plans. An Infrastructure Improvements Plan adopted pursuant
to this section may address 1 or more of the town's categories of necessary
public services in any or all of the town's service areas. Each capital
facility shall be subject to no more than 1 Infrastructure Improvements Plan at
any given time.
   (C)   Reserved capacity. The town may reserve capacity in an Infrastructure
Improvements Plan to serve 1 or more planned future developments, including
capacity reserved through a Development Agreement pursuant to §
154.13. All reservations of existing capacity must be disclosed in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan at the time it is adopted.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.09 ADOPTION AND MODIFICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Adopting or amending the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. The
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall be adopted or amended subject to the
following procedures:
      (1)   Major amendments to the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.  Except
as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, the adoption or amendment of an
Infrastructure Improvement Plan shall occur at 1 or more public hearings
according to the following schedule, as provided in §
154.07:
         (a)   Sixty days before the first public hearing regarding a new or
updated Infrastructure Improvements Plan, the town shall provide public notice
of the hearing and post the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and the underlying
land use assumptions on its website.
         (b)   The town shall conduct a public hearing on the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and underlying land use assumptions at least 30 days, but no

fee analysis. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, the town
may update the Infrastructure Improvements Plan without a public hearing if all
of the following apply:
         (a)   The changes in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan will not add
any new category of necessary public services to any service area.
         (b)   The changes in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan will not
increase the level of service to be provided in any service area.
         (c)   Based on an analysis of the impact fee analysis and the town's
adopted development impact fee schedules, the changes in the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan would not, individually or cumulatively with other amendments
undertaken pursuant to this section, have caused a development impact fee in
any service area to have been increased by more than 5% above the development
impact fee that is provided in the current development impact fee schedule.
         (d)   At least 30 days prior to the date that any amendment pursuant
to this section is adopted, the town shall post a notice of proposed amendments
on the town's website.

days to any timely requests submitted pursuant to division (B)(4) of this
section.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.11 COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Collection. Development impact fees, together with administrative
charges assessed pursuant to division (A)(6) of this section, shall be
calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence
development; specifically:
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a Development Agreement
adopted pursuant to §
154.12, development impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building
permit according to the current development impact fee schedule for the
applicable service area(s).
      (2)   If a building permit is not required for the development, but
utility connections are required, development impact fees due shall be paid at
the time the utility service connection is purchased. If only a wastewater
connection is required, the development impact fees shall be paid prior to
approval of a connection to the sewer system.
      (3)   If the development is located in a service area with a stormwater,
drainage, and flood control development impact fee, and neither a building
permit, or utility service connection is required, the storm drainage
development impact fee due shall be paid at the time a notice is issued to the
developer.
      (4)   No building permit, utility connection, or certificate of occupancy
shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed in the
previous divisions.
      (5)   If the development is for a change in the type of building use, an
increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a
residential or non-residential point of demand to the utility systems, the
development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service units
resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development impact
fee schedule applicable to any new use type. Water development impact fees
shall be based on the meter size required for the development.
      (6)   To the extent that any modification does not meet the requirements
of this division, the development impact fee due shall be the difference
between the development impact fee that was or would have been due on the
existing development and the development impact fee that is due on the
development as modified.
      (7)   If the development is not substantially completed, development
impact fees paid for such development can be refunded.
      (8)   If a new or renewed application for the same development is being
sought by someone other than the original applicant, the new applicant shall
pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in effect at
the time that the application is made. If the original applicant has assigned
its rights under the application to a new applicant, the new applicant shall
pay the difference between any development impact fees paid and those in the
fee schedule at the time of the new application. Exceptions: development impact
fees shall not be owed under either of the following conditions:
         (a)   Development impact fees have been paid for the development and
the permit(s) which triggered the collection of the development impact fees
have not expired or been voided.
         (b)   The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development
impact fees involve modifications to existing residential or non-residential
development that do not: (a) add new EDUs; (b) increase the impact of existing
EDUs on existing or future capital facilities; or (c) change the land-use type
of the existing development to a different category of development for which a
higher development impact fee would have been due. To the extent that any
modification does not meet the requirements of this division, the development
impact fee due shall be the difference between the development impact fee that
was or would have been due on the existing development and the development
impact fee that is due on the development as modified.
   (B)   Temporary exemptions from development impact fee schedules. New master
planned developments with multiple new homes shall be temporarily exempt from
increases in development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or
modified development impact fee schedules as follows: for 24 months after the
first building permit is issued. During the effective period of the applicable
development impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same
development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee
schedule.
   (C)   Other development. Any category of development not covered under
division (B) of this section shall pay development impact fees according to the
fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as specified in division
(A) of this section.
   (D)   Changes to site plans and subdivision plats. Notwithstanding the other
requirements of this section, if changes are made to a development's final site
plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service units after
the issuance of a grandfathered development impact fee schedule, the town may
assess any new or modified development impact fees against the additional
service units. If the town reduces the amount of an applicable development
impact fee during the period that a grandfathered development impact fee
schedule is in force, the town shall assess the lower development impact fee.
   (E)   Option to pursue special fee determination. Where a development is of
a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development
appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development
has unique characteristics or unusual circumstances such that the actual
burdens and costs associated with providing necessary public services to that
development will differ substantially from that associated with other
developments in a specified category of development, the town may require the
applicant to provide an alternative development impact fee analysis.
   (F)   The town shall review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall
make a determination as to the adjusted development impact fee to be charged.
Such decision shall be appealable pursuant to §
154.14. The town may require the applicant to pay an administrative fee to
cover the actual costs of reviewing the special fee determination application.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.12 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE CREDITS AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Eligibility of capital facility. A developer shall receive a credit
against or proportionate reimbursement of an impact fee if:
      (1)   One of the following is true:
         (a)   The capital facility or land for system improvement, or the
financial contribution toward a capital facility that will be provided by the
developer and for which a credit will be issued, must be identified in an
adopted Infrastructure Improvements Plan and Impact Fee Analysis as a capital
facility for which a development impact fee was assessed; or
         (b)   The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town
that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility
should have been included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan in lieu of a
different capital facility that was included in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject
capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the
town shall amend the Infrastructure Improvements Plan to: (i) include the
subject replacement facility; and (ii) delete the capital facility that will be
replaced.
      (2)   Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a
developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by
the town through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the
developer will be paid or reimbursed by the town for any contribution, payment,
construction, or dedication from any town funding source including an agreement
to reimburse the developer with future collected development impact fees
pursuant to §
154.13, any credits claimed by the developer shall be: (a) deducted from any
amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the town; or (b) reduced by the amount of
such payment or reimbursement.
   (B)   Calculation of credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the
costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted Infrastructure
Improvements Plan for which a development fee was assessed pursuant to the
Impact Fee Analysis. If the gross impact fee for a particular category of
necessary public service is adopted at an amount lower than the plan-based cost
per ERU, the amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to the
difference between the plan-based cost per ERU and the gross impact fee
adopted. A credit shall not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in
providing the eligible capital facility.
   (C)   Allocation of credits. Before any credit can be issued to a subject
development (or portion thereof), the credit must be allocated to that
development as follows:
      (1)   The developer and the town must execute a credit agreement
including all of the following:
         (a)   The total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an
eligible capital facility.
         (b)   The estimated number of ERUs to be served within the subject
development.
         (c)   The method by which the credit values will be distributed within
the subject development.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of
development impact fee credits through an application for a credit agreement
(which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to §
154.13).
      (3)   If a building permit is issued or a utility connection is
purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a credit
agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated
retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any
remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this chapter.
      (4)   If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or
relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior
to execution of a Credit Agreement or Development Agreement, credits resulting
from the eligible capital facility will only be allocated to the development if
the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor(s)
in interest for the subject development.
      (5)   If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible capital facility,
both entities must enter into a single credit agreement with the town, and any
request for the allocation of credit within the subject development(s) must be
made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible capital facility.
      (6)   Credits may only be reallocated from or within a subject
development with the town's approval of an amendment to an executed credit
agreement, subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town,
or its legal successor in interest and the entity that currently controls the
subject development are parties to the request for reallocation.
         (b)   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
credits already issued for the subject development.
      (7)   A credit agreement may authorize the allocation of credits to a
non-contiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The entity that executed the original agreement with the town or
its legal successor in interest, the entity that currently controls the subject
development, and the entity that controls the non-contiguous parcel are parties
to the request for reallocation.
         (b)   The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any
credits already issued for the subject development.
         (c)   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that
served by the eligible capital facility.
         (d)   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service
from the eligible capital facility.
         (e)   The credit agreement specifically states the value of the
credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or ERU, or establishes a mechanism
for future determination of the credit values.
         (f)   The credit agreement does not involve the transfer of credits to
or from any property subject to a development agreement.
   (D)   Credit agreement. Credits shall only be issued pursuant to a credit
agreement executed in accordance with division (D) of this section. The Town
Manager or authorized designee is authorized by this chapter to enter into a
credit agreement with the controlling entity of a subject development, subject
to the following:
      (1)   The developer requesting the credit agreement shall provide all
information requested by the town to allow it to determine the value of the
credit to be applied.
      (2)   An application for a credit agreement shall be submitted to the
town by the developer within 1 year of the date on which ownership or control
of the capital facility passes to the town.
      (3)   The developer shall submit a draft credit agreement to the Town
Manager or authorized designee(s) for review in the form provided to the
applicant by the town. The draft credit agreement shall include, at a minimum,
all of the following information and supporting documentation:
         (a)   A legal description and map depicting the location of the
subject development for which credit is being applied. The map shall depict the
location of the capital facilities that have been or will be provided.
         (b)   An estimate of the total ERUs that will be developed within the
subject development depicted on the map and described in the legal description.
         (c)   A list of the capital facilities, associated physical
attributes, and the related costs as stated in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan.
         (d)   Documentation showing the date(s) of acceptance by the town, if
the capital facilities have already been provided.
         (e)   The total amount of credit to be applied within the subject
development and the calculations leading to the total amount of credit.
         (f)   The credit amount to be applied to each ERU within the subject
development for each category of necessary public services.
      (4)   Upon execution of the credit agreement by the town and the
applicant, credits shall be deemed allocated to the subject development.
      (5)   Any amendment to a previously approved credit agreement must be
initiated within 2 years of the town's final acceptance of the eligible capital
facility for which the amendment is requested.
      (6)   Any credit agreement approved as part of a development agreement
shall be amended in accordance with the terms of the development agreement and
§
154.13.
   (E)   Issuance of credits. Credits allocated pursuant to division (D) of
this section may be issued and applied toward the gross impact fees due from a
development, subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Credits issued for an eligible capital facility may only be applied
to the development impact fee due for the applicable category of necessary
public services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another category of
necessary public services.
      (2)   Credits shall only be issued when the eligible capital facility
from which the credits were derived has been accepted by the town or when
adequate security for the completion of the eligible capital facility has been
provided in accordance with all terms of an executed development agreement.
      (3)   Where credits have been issued pursuant to division (E)(2) of this
section, an impact fee due at the time a building permit is issued shall be
reduced by the credit amount stated in or calculated from the executed credit
agreement. Where credits have not yet been issued, the gross impact fee shall
be paid in full, and a refund of the credit amount shall be due when the
developer demonstrates compliance with division (E)(2) of this section in a
written request to the town.
      (4)   Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to
another permit or parcel, except that credits may be released for reuse on the
same subject development if a building permit or application for which the
credits were issued has expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a
refund under §
154.15(A)(2)(a).
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.13 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   Development agreements containing provisions regarding development impact
fees, development impact fee credits, and/or disbursement of revenues from
development impact fee accounts shall comply with the following:
   (A)   Development Agreement required. A Development Agreement is required to
authorize any of the following:
      (1)   To issue credits prior to the town's acceptance of an eligible
capital facility.
      (2)   To allocate credits to a parcel that is not contiguous with the
subject development and that does not meet the requirements of §
154.12(D).
      (3)   To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using
funds from development impact fee accounts.
      (4)   To allocate different credit amounts per ERU to different parcels
within a subject development.
      (5)   For a single family residential dwelling unit, to allow development
impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit
as provided in this section.
   (B)   General requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared and
executed by resolution or in accordance with ordinance, A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and
any applicable requirements of the Town Code. Development agreements relating
to property located outside the incorporated area do not become operative
unless annexation proceedings are completed within the time period specified in
the development agreement. Development agreements shall be consistent with the
town General Plan. Development agreements shall be recorded with the county
recorder within 10 days of entering into the agreement and the effective date
cannot be less than 30 days after final approval. Except where specifically
modified by this section, all provisions of §
154.12 shall apply to any credit agreement that is authorized as part of a
development agreement.
   (C)   Early credit issuance. A development agreement may authorize the
issuance of credits prior to acceptance of an eligible capital facility by the
town when the development agreement specifically states the form and value of
the security (i.e. bond, letter of credit, and the like) to be provided to the
town prior to issuance of any credits. The town shall determine the acceptable
form and value of the security to be provided.
   (D)   Non-contiguous credit allocation. A development agreement may
authorize the allocation of credits to a non-contiguous parcel only if all of
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that
served by the eligible capital facility.
      (2)   The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from
the eligible capital facility.
      (3)   The development agreement specifically states the value of the
credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or ERU, or establishes a mechanism
for future determination of the credit values.
   (E)   Uneven credit allocation. The development agreement must specify how
credits will be allocated amongst different parcels on a per-ERU basis, if the
credits are not to be allocated evenly. If the development agreement is silent
on this topic, all credits will be allocated evenly amongst all parcels on a
per-ERU basis.
   (F)   Use of reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from impact fee
accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be utilized in
accordance with applicable law for the use of town funds in construction or
acquisition of capital facilities.
   (G)   Waiver of fees. If the town agrees to waive any development impact
fees assessed on development in a development agreement, the town shall
reimburse the appropriate development impact fee account for the amount that
was waived.
   (H)   No obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the town to enter
into any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit agreement
permitted by this section.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.14 APPEALS.
   A development impact fee determination by town staff may be appealed in
accordance with the following procedures:
   (A)   Limited scope. An appeal shall be limited to disputes regarding the
calculation of the development impact fees for a specific development and/or
permit and calculation of ERU's for the development.
   (B)   Form of appeal. An appeal shall be initiated on such written form as
the town may prescribe by following the appeal process in §
153.005 above.
   (C)   Fees during pendency. Building permits may be issued during the
pendency of an appeal if the applicant: (1) pays the full impact fee calculated
by the town at the time the appeal is filed; or (2) provides the town with
financial assurances in the form acceptable to the Town Manager or authorized
designee equal to the full amount of the impact fee. Upon final disposition of
an appeal, the fee shall be adjusted in accordance with the decision rendered,
and a refund paid if warranted. If the appeal is denied by the town, and the
applicant has provided the town with financial assurances as set forth in
clause (2) above, the applicant shall deliver the full amount of the impact fee
to the town within 10 days of the town final decision on the appeal. If the
applicant fails to deliver the full amount of the impact fees when required by
this section, the town may draw upon such financial assurance instrument(s) as
necessary to recover the full amount of the impact fees due from the applicant.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015; Am. Ord. 2017-03, passed 11-13-2017)
§ 154.15 REFUNDS OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to a developer or
property owner who submits a written request to the town and demonstrates that:
      (1)   The developer has not proceeded with the development, the
development impact fees collected have not been expended, encumbered, or
pledged for the repayment of financing or debt, and no impact has resulted; or
      (2)   After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility the town
fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time period
identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, as it may be amended, and
the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject real property
from that capital facility or any other infrastructure and no impact has
resulted.
         (a)   For a category of necessary public services other than water or
wastewater facilities, any part of a development impact fee is not spent within
10 years of the town's receipt of the development impact fee.
         (b)   Any part of a development impact fee for water or wastewater
facilities is not spent within 15 years of the town's receipt of the
development impact fee.
      (3)   If the actual construction costs for the capital facility are less
than the construction costs projected in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan
by a factor of 10% or more, the refund shall be the difference between the
amounts of the development impact fee charged for and attributable to such
construction cost and the amount the development impact fee would have been
calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the
Impact Fee Analysis. The refund contemplated by this subsection shall relate
only to the costs specific to the construction of the applicable capital
facility and shall not include any related design, administrative, or other
costs not directly incurred for construction of the capital facility that are
included in the development impact fee.
   (B)   Earned interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include
any interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development impact
fee by the town from the date of collection to the date of refund.
   (C)   Refund to government. If a development impact fee was paid by a
governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity.
(Ord. 2015-01, passed 2-18-2015)
§ 154.16 OVERSIGHT OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE PROGRAM.
   (A)   Annual report. Within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year, the town
shall file with the Town Clerk an unaudited annual report accounting for the
collection and use of the fees for each service area and shall post the report
on its website in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05(N) and (O), as amended.
   (B)   Biennial audit. In addition to the Annual Report described in division
(A) of this section, the town shall provide for a biennial, certified audit of
the town's land use assumptions, Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
development impact fees.
      (1)   An audit pursuant to this section shall be conducted by 1 or more
qualified professionals who are not employees or officials of the town and who
did not prepare the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
      (2)   The audit shall review the collection and expenditures of
development fees for each project in the plan and provide written comments
describing the amount of development impact fees assessed, collected, and spent
on capital facilities.
      (3)   The audit shall describe the level of service in each service area,
and evaluate any inequities in implementing the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan or imposing the development impact fee.
      (4)   The town shall post the findings of the audit on the website of the
town, and shall conduct a public hearing on the audit within 60 days of the
release of the audit to the public.

§ 155.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   It is hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for
endangering the lives and property of users of the Colorado City Municipal
Airport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction
may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums at the Colorado
City Municipal Airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas
available for the landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to
destroy or impair the utility of the Colorado City Municipal Airport and the
public investment therein.
   (B)   Accordingly, it is declared:
      (1)   That the Colorado City Municipal Airport fulfills an essential
community purpose;
      (2)   That the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the
potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the
Colorado City Municipal Airport;
      (3)   That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public
safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions
that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented;
      (4)   That the creation or establishment of a use which is inconsistent
with the nature of the Colorado City Municipal Airport may injure the region
served by the airport and the utility of the airport;
      (5)   That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public
safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of uses which are
inconsistent with air navigation and development of the airport and its use be
prevented;
      (6)   That the encroachment of noise sensitive or otherwise incompatible
land uses within certain areas as set forth herein below may endanger the
health, safety and welfare of the owners, occupants or users of the land; and
      (7)   That the prevention of these uses or obstructions should be
accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police
power of the municipality.
   (C)   It is further declared that the prevention of inconsistent uses, the
elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation, or
the marking and lighting of construction are public purposes for which a
political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or
interests in land.
   (D)   It is hereby ordained by the Town of Colorado City as follows.

§ 155.04 AIRPORT HEIGHT RESTRICTION ZONES.
   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Colorado City Municipal Airport. Such
zones are shown on the Colorado City Municipal Airport Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) Part 77 Airspace Drawing. Three original, official, and
identical copies of the FAR Part 77 Airspace Drawing reflecting the boundaries
of the airport height restriction overlay zoning districts of the Town of
Colorado City, Arizona are hereby adopted, and the Commissioner and Colorado
City Town Clerk are hereby authorized to sign and attest each map as the
official Colorado City Municipal Airport FAR Part 77 Airspace Drawing of the
Town of Colorado City, Arizona, and such maps shall be filed and maintained as
follows:
      (1)   One copy shall be filed for permanent record in the office of the
Colorado City Town Clerk and shall be designated as Exhibit 1. This copy shall
not be changed in any manner.
      (2)   One copy shall be filed in the Planning and Zoning Department and
shall be designated as Exhibit 2. This copy shall be maintained by the Planning
and Zoning Department by posting thereon all subsequent changes and amendments.
      (3)   One copy shall be filed in the office of the Airport Manager and
shall be designated as Exhibit 3. This copy shall be maintained by the Airport
Manager by posting thereon all subsequent changes and amendments.
   (B)   Each portion of an area located in more than one of the following
zones shall be evaluated independently according to the zone in which it is
located. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      (1)   Precision instrument runway approach zone (larger than utility
runway).  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet.
Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (2)   Nonprecision instrument runway approach zone (larger than utility
runway). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance 10,000 feet from
the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of
the runway.
      (3)   Nonprecision instrument runway approach zone (utility aircraft).
The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (4)   Visual runway approach zone (larger than utility runway). The inner
edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is 500 feet wide. The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 1,500
feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (5)   Visual runway approach zone (utility aircraft). The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250
feet wide. The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. The centerline of
the approach zone is a continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (6)   Transitional zone. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
      (7)   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 5,000 or 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of the primary runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines
tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones. The horizontal zone was constructed with 10,000 feet radii.
      (8)   Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there
from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.

§ 155.05 AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established and defined for each of the zones as follows:
   (A)   Precision instrument runway approach zone. Slopes 50 feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline. Then slopes 40 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the first 10,000 feet and
extending to a horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway
centerline.
   (B)   Nonprecision instrument runway approach zone (larger than utility
runway). Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of
and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
   (C)   Nonprecision instrument runway approach zone (utility aircraft).
Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
   (D)   Visual runway approach zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface
and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway
centerline.
   (E)   Transitional zone. Slopes 7 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits
sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at
the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they
intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach
zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits
sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at
the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance
of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
   (F)   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation.
   (G)   Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.

§ 155.06 COMPATIBLE LAND USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Airport compatible land use overlay zoning districts. For the purpose
of regulating the development of noise sensitive land uses to promote
compatibility between the airport and the surrounding land uses, to protect the
airport from incompatible development and to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of property users, the controlled area of Colorado City
Municipal Airport is divided into Airport Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning
Districts. The Airport Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning Districts established
herein shall be known as:
 
Off Airport Land Use Zone Number Zoning District Name
D                                Airport Influence Zone (AIZ)

A                                Runway Protection Zone (RPZ)
 
   (B)   Off Airport Land Use Drawing.  The boundaries of the Airport
Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning Districts set out herein are delineated upon
the Colorado City Municipal Airport Off Airport Land Use Drawing of the Town of
Colorado City, Arizona. Said Off Airport Land Use Drawing is adopted by
reference and made a part of this chapter as fully as if the same were set
forth herein in detail.
   (C)   Three original, official, and identical copies of the Off Airport Land
Use Drawing reflecting the boundaries of the Airport Compatible Land Use
Overlay Zoning Districts of the Town of Colorado City, Arizona are hereby
adopted, and the Commissioner and the Colorado City Town Clerk are hereby
authorized to sign and attest each map as the official Off Airport Land Use
Drawing of the Town of Colorado City, Arizona, and such maps shall be filed and
maintained as follows:
      (1)   One copy shall be filed for permanent record in the office of the
Colorado City Town Clerk and shall be designated as Exhibit 1. This copy shall
not be changed in any manner.
      (2)   One copy shall be filed in the Planning and Zoning Department and
shall be designated as Exhibit 2. This copy shall be maintained by the Planning
Department by posting thereon all subsequent changes and amendments.
      (3)   One copy shall be filed in the office of the Airport Manager and
shall be designated as Exhibit 3. This copy shall be maintained by the Airport
Manager by posting thereon all subsequent changes and amendments.
   (D)   Airport compatible land use overlay zoning district boundary lines.
Land use overlay zoning district boundary lines shown on the official Off
Airport Land Use Drawing shall be located and delineated along contour lines
established for the Colorado City Municipal Airport. Where uncertainty exists
as to the boundaries of the Airport Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning
Districts as shown on the official map, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Boundaries shall be scaled from the nearest runway end shown on the
map.
      (2)   Boundaries shall be scaled from the nearest physical feature shown
on the map.
      (3)   Boundaries may be scaled from the nearest platted lot line as shown
on the map.
      (4)   Distances not specifically indicated on the original Off Airport
Land Use Drawing shall be determined by a scaled measurement on the map.
   (E)   Where physical features on the ground differ from the information
shown on the official Off Airport Land Use Drawing or when there arises a
question as to how or where a parcel of property is zoned and such questions
cannot be resolved by the application of division (D), the property shall be
considered to be classified as the most restrictive Airport Compatible Land Use
Overlay Zoning District.
   (F)   Where a parcel of land lies within more than 1 Airport Compatible Land
Use Overlay Zoning District, the zone within which each portion of the property
is located shall apply individually to each portion of the development.
   (G)   Use of land and buildings. Within the Airport Compatible Land Use
Overlay Zoning Districts as defined herein, no land shall hereafter be used and
no structure or other object shall hereafter be erected, altered, converted or
modified other than for those compatible land uses permitted by underlying
comprehensive zoning districts, as specified in the Town of Colorado City Land
Use Code. Additional land uses are prohibited in the Airport Compatible Land
Use Overlay Zoning Districts, regardless of underlying zoning, as set forth in
the Land Use Compatibility Table in §
155.13.
   (H)   Where any use of prohibited land and buildings set forth in division
(G) conflicts with any use of land and buildings set forth in the Town of
Colorado Land Use Code, as an allowed use on the Zoning District Map, this
chapter shall apply.
   (I)   Division (G) does not apply to property within the official boundaries
of the airport.
   (J)   Where specified on the Airport Compatible Land Use Table, the property
owner shall dedicate, in advance of receiving a building permit, an aviation
clear zone easement to the Town of Colorado City, Arizona. The purpose of this
easement shall be to establish a maximum height restriction on the use of
property and to hold the public harmless for any damages caused by noise,
vibration, fumes, dust, fuel, fuel particles, or other effects that may be
caused by the operation of aircraft landing at, taking off from, or operating
on, or at, public airport facilities.
   (K)   All structures and uses within the Approach Zone (AZ) or Runway
protection Zone (RPZ) shall be limited to the following:
      (1)   No glare producing materials shall be used on the exterior of any
structure, including any metal building, which are hazardous to aviation; and
      (2)   There shall be no display of signs which produce a flashing or
blinking effect, nor shall any lighting project upward in a manner that would
interfere with aircraft.
   (L)   Additional land use regulations. Within the Town of Colorado City,
Arizona the more restrictive of the Town of Colorado City Land Use Code or
division (G) above, shall apply to the development of all property covered by
the Off Airport Land Use Drawing.
   (M)   On property within the Off Airport Land Use Drawing jurisdiction, but
outside the incorporated limits of the Town of Colorado City, Arizona, division
(G) above shall apply to the development of all property covered by the Off
Airport Land Use Drawing, and to formulate land use recommendations or
responses from other jurisdictions.
   (N)   When a provision of this section conflicts with any airport height
hazard restrictions, the most restrictive provision shall apply.
   (O)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or other chapter
of the Town of Colorado City Land Use Code, no use may be made of land, water,
or structures within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, or result in glare in the eyes
of pilots using the airport; impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, taking off or flight operations of aircraft utilizing the airport.
   (P)   When a subdivision plat is required for any property within an Airport
Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning District or within an area shown on the FAR
Part 77 Airspace Drawing for the Colorado City Municipal Airport, the property
owner shall dedicate an aviation hazard easement to the Town of Colorado City
over and across that property. This easement shall establish a height
restriction on the use of the property and hold the public harmless from any
damages caused by noise, vibration, fumes, dust, fuel, fuel particles, or other
effects that may be caused by the operation of aircraft taking off, landing, or
operating on or near the Colorado City Municipal Airport.

§ 155.07 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any
change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted. Any structure previously regulated
by airport zoning must comply with the previously existing regulations.
Nonconforming land uses existing as of the effective date of this chapter may
be modified such that:
      (1)   Only existing structures may be enlarged or expanded;
      (2)   That they do not result in any greater violation of height
restrictions; and
      (3)   A variance in accordance with §
155.08(H) is obtained.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree may be
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Town of Colorado City to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the town.
(Ord. 2009-01, passed 4-13-2009; Am. Ord. 2020-01, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 155.08 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in division (D) below, no
material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected
or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby
created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted.
   (B)   Application. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose
for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to
be determined whether the regulating use, structure, or tree would conform to
the regulations herein prescribed. Each application shall be accompanied by an
application fee as established by resolution of the Town Council. Each
application shall also include the following information:
      (1)   Property boundary lines as they relate to the zone boundaries shown
on the Off Airport Land Use Map;
      (2)   Location, elevation, use and height of all existing and proposed
buildings, structures, utility lines, roads or trees where trees are taller
than 35 feet;
      (3)   Maximum elevations of proposed structures. Elevations shall be
based upon the survey of an Arizona registered professional engineer or
licensed land surveyor, accurate to plus or minus 1 foot shown as mean sea
level elevation;
      (4)   An FAA Form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.
   (C)   No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
division (H) below.
   (D)   In the area lying within the limits of the approach zone, transition
zone, horizontal zone, and conical zone, no permit shall be required by this
chapter for any tree or structure less than 200 feet above ground level which
is also lower than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward at a slope
of 100 feet horizontal for each 1 foot vertical beginning at the closest point
of the closest runway.
   (E)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter.
   (F)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of any obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when
the application for a permit is made.
   (G)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Town of
Colorado City determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (H)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Hearing
Officer for a variance from such regulations by following the appeal and
variance process in Town Code Chapter 153. The application for variance shall
be accompanied by a determination from, the Federal Aviation Administration as
to the effect of a proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and
the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed
where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be
contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation,
will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the appeal and
variance procedure outlined in Town Code
Chapter 153.
   (I)   Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this
chapter may be considered by the Hearing Officer unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the Town of Colorado City for advice as to
the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Town of Colorado City does not
respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Hearing Officer
may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
   (J)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner’s expense, such markings and lights as condition may require in
accordance with FAA provisions.

§ 156.01 TITLE.
   These regulations shall hereafter be known, cited and referred to as the
“Development Standards.”
(Ord. 2017-02, passed 11-13-2017)
§ 156.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of the Development Standards is to provide the development
community with a consistent set of standards to guide the physical development
and the visual quality of the community to be reviewed and approved with the
site plan and preliminary plat, or development agreement process. These
criteria are intended to assist in orderly growth and promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of the community.
   (B)   Chapter One of the Town of Colorado City’s General Plan states that,
“Greatplaces are designed for human comfort, safety, and enjoyment. They
develop when people inspired by quality of purpose are moved to provide for the
needs of the people. Great places are not created quickly. They are conceived
as a pattern of roads, buildings, and open spaces. When that pattern is a close
match to a community’s values it increases that community’s quality of life.”
These development standards are guided by the General Plan of the Town of
Colorado City.
(Ord. 2017-02, passed 11-13-2017; Am. Ord. 2021-22, passed 12-13-2021)
§ 156.03 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   These Development Standards are intended to enhance and maintain the
quality of the community by providing guidance for property development and
design, including new single-unit residences, multi-unit residences,
commercial, and industrial areas. The Development Standards are composed of
development and design guidelines that provide the basis for development review
and are for the benefit of all.
   (B)   Improving these Development Standards is the desire and in the best
interest of everyone. The Town of Colorado City (hereafter referred to as
“town,” encourage everyone’s suggestions.
   (C)   All development shall comply with the code of ordinances of the town
and the state statutes of the State of Arizona. Any unauthorized development
shall be unlawful, against the public safety and welfare, and a public
nuisance, and the town may immediately commence all necessary actions or
proceedings for the abatement, enjoinment and removal thereof in the manner
provided by A.R.S. § 9-467 and may take other lawful steps and may apply to the
court or courts as may have jurisdiction to grant such relief as will abate,
enjoin and restrain any person, firm, partnership, or corporation from setting
up, developing, erecting, building, moving or maintaining any such building,
developing or selling any property contrary to the provisions of these
Development Standards.
   (D)   Violations of the provisions of this code are considered civil code
infractions subject to general penalties specified in Town Code §
10.99 General Penalty and City Code Chapter 4, Ordinance Violations and
Penalties, except that violations of this code shall not be considered a
separate offense for each day that the violation continues.
   (E)   If a provision/rule/regulation in these “Development Standards”
conflicts with another provision/rule/regulation in these “Development
Standards” or any other town code, the more restrictive provision/rule/
regulation shall apply unless approved by the town planning commission.
   (F)   The Development Standards in this document shall comply with the Fair
Housing Act contained in U.S. Code: Title 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.

for the erection of a structure in the proposed development is granted, the
property owner (developer), or his or her authorized agent, shall apply for and
secure approval of the proposed development in accordance with the procedures
outlined herein.
      (2)   Building permits will only be issued after fire hydrants are
operable and a fire apparatus access road is available to the building site.
   (B)   Grading. Any development of property which includes grading that
changes the historic drainage on the subject property or adjacent property,
proposed utility service, preparation for building construction or other
infrastructure development or commercial activities such as recreational
facilities, campgrounds, RV parks, and the like must have prior development
review approval by the Planning and Zoning Department.

any parts of any system within the rights of way, in which event the town shall
not be liable therefor to a communications system provider. The town shall
notify a provider in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon
as possible and in no case later than the next business day following any
action taken under this section.
      (6)   A communications system provider shall, upon prior reasonable
written notice by the town or any person holding a permit to move any
structure, and within the time that is reasonable under the circumstances,

other than the town for any such movement of its systems.
      (7)   A communications system provider shall be liable for the costs
incurred by the town to replace or repair and restore to its prior condition in
a manner as may be reasonably specified by the town, any town property,
structure or any other rights of way of the town involved in the construction,
maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system that may become disturbed
or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of a communications
system provider.
      (8)   All structures, lines and equipment installed by a communications
system provider within the town shall be located and installed in accordance
with town ordinances governing street excavation and use of public rights of
way, and shall be located so as not to obstruct or interfere with the proper
use of rights of way and other public ways and places, and to cause a minimum
of interference with the rights of property owners who abut any of the said
rights of way alleys and other public ways and places, and not to interfere
with existing public utility installations.
      (9)   All cables, wires and other equipment shall be installed, where
possible, parallel with electric and telephone lines of the incumbent local
exchange carrier, and shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other
facilities whenever possible.
      (10)   A permittee may trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets,
alleys, sidewalks, or public easements of the town so as to prevent the
branches of such trees coming in contact with the wires and cables of the
provider, provided that severe cutting back of tops of trees to stubs larger
than three inches within the tree’s crown to such an extent so as to remove the
normal canopy and result in disfigurement of the tree shall be unlawful unless
approved by the town. The provider is responsible for harm caused to the trees
by improper pruning or trimming. Prior to undertaking any tree trimming,
provider shall notify town and/or other property owner of grantee’s intent.
      (11)   In all areas of the town where cables, wires and other like
facilities of all other public utilities are placed or required to be placed
underground, each communications system provider shall construct and install
its system underground.
         (a)   With respect to any portion of the communications system
constructed and installed aboveground, the communications system provider
shall, at its sole expense, reconstruct and reinstall such system underground
pursuant to any project under which like facilities of similar systems are
placed underground or wherever the owner of a pole on which the provider is
located moves its equipment underground.
         (b)   Electronic equipment may be placed aboveground in appropriate
structures where existing technology reasonably requires, but shall be of such
size and design and shall be so located as not to be unsightly or unsafe.
         (c)   Each communications system provider shall, as a condition of
access to the rights of way, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the town, its
officers, boards, commissions, elected officials, agents, attorneys,
representatives, servants and employees, from and against any liability for
damages, costs, expenses, claims, suits, actions, judgments and liabilities,
including, but not limited to, expenses for legal fees, whether suit be brought
or not, disbursements and liabilities incurred or assumed by town in connection
with or in any way connected with acts or omissions of communications system
provider’s work in or use of the right-of-way, including any and all claims
which the communications system provider may now or hereafter have or claim to
have against the city, its servants, agents, attorneys, representatives,
employees or officials, due to or arising out of damage to any of the
provider’s property or equipment in the rights of way, including, without
limitation, resulting or consequential loss of income, injury to reputation, or
any other resulting or consequential damages of any kind, caused by or
resulting from acts or omissions of the town or any of its servants, agents,
attorneys, representatives, employees or officials except to the extent that
such indemnity is prohibited by law.
         (d)   If a franchise expires, is validly revoked, or the facilities
installed pursuant to the franchise are abandoned, the town may:
            1.   Require the provider to stop providing the franchised
services; and
            2.   Require the provider to remove all or portions of the system
that are not in the rights of way by virtue of another, valid franchise, within
a reasonable time specified by the town; and
            3.   Require the provider to convey title to facilities that are
not removed (abandoned) and that are not in the rights of way by virtue of
another, valid franchise, in a form satisfactory to the town and free and clear
of all liens and encumbrances to the town.
         (e)   In the event that the use of any portion of the franchised
system is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, and 30 days after
no response to written notice from the town to the last known address of
provider, the provider shall be deemed to have abandoned such system.
         (f)   A provider shall comply with all applicable laws in removing
facilities and restore any affected rights of way to as good condition as that
prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any
electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles or attachments.
            1.   Applicable liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of
this code and of the franchise shall continue to apply as if the franchise was
in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance
by a provider with the terms and conditions of this section.
            2.   If a provider fails to remove or restore the town may do so
and charge the provider for all costs incurred in doing so.
         (g)   Subject to the town rights for conveyance of title listed above
in this section, a provider may abandon any underground system in place so long
as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights of way or with
the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other person.
         (h)   Communications service and infrastructure providers that are not
subject to municipal telecommunications license tax or sales tax, and who are
required to obtain a franchise shall pay a franchise fee, which fee shall be
specified in the franchise.
            1.   The fee shall be designed, as far as is possible, in
connection with the provisions of communications sources to be equivalent to
the tax that would be owed if the applicant were subject to the municipal
telecommunications license or sales tax, and will generally be based upon gross
revenues.
            2.   Where a communications or infrastructure service provider
places facilities in the town, but does not provide services within the town;
or obtains a franchise that only authorizes placement of facilities from point
to point, the city may require that the fee be based on per foot or similar
basis.
            3.   The provider is responsible for paying and obtaining the
information necessary to calculate the gross revenues fee owed to the town,
unless:
               a.   The provider agrees to conditions that ensure that no
person may use the system without first entering into an agreement with the
town that obligates that person to pay fees to the town; and
               b.   Provider agrees that it will not permit its system to be
used by a person that does not agree to pay fees to the town.
         (i)   Future costs: subject to the limitations under state law, a
telecommunications service provider shall pay to the town or to third parties,
at the direction of the town, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
chapter or a franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations.
         (j)   The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or
other assessment, except as specifically provided in this chapter or as
required by applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, fees to
obtain space on the town owned poles are not waived and remain applicable.
