city is located; and
      (2)   "This charter" refers to chapters 18-22 of this title.
   (b)   Whenever the "county election commission" is referred to in chapters
18-22 of this title, it means the county election commission of the county in
which the territory proposed to be incorporated or the municipality is
situated. If the territory proposed to be incorporated or the municipality
includes parts of two (2) or more counties, it means the county election
commission in each of such counties and they shall act jointly in performing
the functions required of county election commissions in chapters 18-22 of this
title. [Acts 1921, ch. 173, art. 22, § 1; Shan. Supp., § 1997a244; Code 1932, §
3642;
Acts 1977, ch. 300, § 1; T.C.A. (orig. ed.), § 6-1801.]
6-18-102. Construction of chapters 18-22.
In the construction of any portion of chapters 18-22 of this title whose
meaning or application is in dispute, it is intended that its phraseology shall
be liberally construed to effect the substantial objects of these chapters.
[Acts 1921, ch. 173, art. 22, § 2; Shan. Supp., § 1997a245; Code 1932, § 3643;
T.C.A. (orig. ed.), § 6-1802.]
6-18-103. Right to adopt city manager form-Incorporation within specified
distances from existing cities.
   (a)   (1)   The residents of any incorporated municipality or of any
territory that it is desired to incorporate shall have the right to adopt
chapters 18-22 of this title in the manner provided in this charter; and
thereupon such city or territory shall be and become incorporated and be
governed as set forth in this charter. No unincorporated territory shall be
incorporated under chapters 18-22 of this title unless such territory contains
not less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) persons, who shall be actual
residents of the territory, and shall also contain real estate included in the
territory worth not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000).
      (2)   No unincorporated territory shall be allowed to hold a referendum
on the question of whether or not to incorporate under this charter until a
plan of services is documented, setting forth the identification and projected
timing of municipal services proposed to be provided and the revenue from
purely local sources to be payable annually. The plan of services shall be
attached to the petition to incorporate when such petition is filed with the
county election commission. The plan of services shall include, but not be
limited to, police protection, fire protection, water service, sanitary sewage
system, solid waste disposal, road and street construction and repair,
recreational facilities, a proposed five-year operational budget, including
projected revenues and expenditures, and the revenue from purely local sources
to be payable annually. Municipalities that are first incorporated on or after
July 1, 1993, and that produce no local own-source revenues in any fiscal year,
shall not receive any state-shared revenues during the next fiscal year.
      (3)   Prior to filing the petition with the county election commission, a
public hearing on the referendum on the question of whether or not to
incorporate under this charter and plan of services shall be conducted. The
public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation for
two (2) consecutive weeks.
   (b)   No unincorporated territory shall be incorporated within three (3)
miles of an existing municipality or within five (5) miles of an existing
municipality of one hundred thousand (100,000) or more in population, according
to the latest census certified by the department of economic and community
development. "Existing municipality" and "existing municipality of one hundred
thousand (100,000) or more in population" do not include any county with a
metropolitan form of government with a population of one hundred thousand
(100,000) or more, according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent
federal census certified by the department of economic and community
development.
   (c)   Notwithstanding subsection (a) or (b) to the contrary, a territory may
be incorporated if the following conditions are fulfilled:
      (1)   The territory contains two hundred twenty-five (225) residents or
more;
      (2)   The territory is composed of property that is one thousand six
hundred feet (1,600') or more above sea level on the western border of the
territory and contiguous with a county boundary on the eastern border of the
territory;
      (3)   The territory is located within an area that is bordered on the
west, north and east by the Tennessee River and on the south by the border
between Tennessee and another state; and
      (4)   The territory is located within a metropolitan statistical area.
   (d)   Notwithstanding subsections (a)-(c) to the contrary, a territory may
be incorporated that meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The territory contains three hundred (300) residents or more;
      (2)   The territory's western boundary is contiguous with the western
boundary of the county in which it is located;
      (3)   The territory is located within an area that is bordered on the
north by the Loosahatchie River and on the south by the Wolf River;
      (4)   The territory's eastern boundary is approximately parallel with the
western boundary, but in no place is more than eight (8) miles from the western
boundary; and
      (5)   The territory is located within a metropolitan statistical area.
   (e)   Notwithstanding the requirements of § 6-18-104, or any other provision
of law to the contrary, the petition for incorporation of the territory
described in subsection (d) may consist of a letter from a resident of the
territory desiring to incorporate to the county election commission requesting
that the question of incorporating the territory be placed on the ballot. The
letter shall describe the exact boundaries of the proposed municipality,
indicate the name of the proposed municipality, and indicate under which
charter the territory desires to incorporate. The letter shall be treated as a
petition meeting all the requirements of law.
   (f)   (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, whenever
the governing body of any existing city affected by this section, by a
resolution adopted by a majority vote of its governing body, indicates that it
has no interest in annexing the property to be incorporated, and when a
certified copy of such resolution and a petition requesting that an
incorporation election be held are filed with the county election commission,
then the proceedings shall continue as provided in this chapter as though the
proposed new incorporation was not within the specified distance of such
existing city as provided in this section.
      (2)   Subdivision (f)(1) shall only apply in counties having a population
of not less than eighty thousand (80,000) nor more than eighty-three thousand
(83,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal
census; provided, that in any adjoining county an existing municipality that is
within the specified distance may also use the procedure authorized by
subdivision (f)(1).

commission upon the petition in writing of thirty-three and one-third percent
(33 1/3%) of the registered voters of the city or territory, which petition
shall state therein in a sufficient manner the boundaries of the proposed
municipal corporation, which may be done by a general reference to the

   (b)   At any time not less than thirty (30) days prior to the election
provided for in this section, the request or petition may be withdrawn or may
be amended to call for a smaller territory for the proposed municipal
corporation so long as all of the proposed smaller territory is contained
within the boundaries of the territory described in the first petition or
request. The withdrawal or amendment shall be valid if filed with the county
election commission in writing and executed by twenty percent (20%) of the
number of the registered voters voting at the last election within the
boundaries of the territory described in the original request or petition, and
if signed by not less than fifty-one percent (51%) of those who signed the
original request or petition. In the event such an amended request or petition
is filed, all provisions relating to time periods in § 6-18-103 shall be
controlled by the date of the filing of the original petition, notwithstanding
the filing of the amended request or petition, and the county election
commission shall publish the notice of election as provided for in this
section. A petition for request to withdraw, when filed with and validated by
the county election commission, shall render the original request or petition
null and void.
   (c)   Following the defeat of an incorporation in an election held pursuant
to this section, no new request for petition for an election may be filed until
after the expiration of four (4) years. If the territory included in the
boundaries of the newly proposed municipal corporation includes less than fifty
percent (50%) of the territory subject to incorporation in such previous
election, and if the territory subject to incorporation in such election
comprises less than fifty percent (50%) of the territory included in the
boundaries of the newly proposed municipal corporation, the four-year waiting
period shall not be required.
   (d)   (1)   If a proposal to incorporate a territory is defeated in an
election held pursuant to this section by a number of negative votes comprising
more than sixty percent (60%) of the persons voting, no further incorporation
election shall be held for a period of four (4) years from the previous
election unless the conditions established in subsection (c) are met.
      (2)   If a proposal to incorporate a territory is defeated in an election
held pursuant to this section by a number of negative votes comprising less
than sixty percent (60%) of the persons voting, no further incorporation
election shall be held for a period of two (2) years from the previous election
unless the conditions established in subsection (c) are met.

ownership of all property of the city and all of its uncollected taxes, dues,
claims, judgments, and choses in action, and all of its rights of every kind
whatsoever, shall immediately become vested in the corporation so chartered

this title containing the signatures of the same number of registered voters
and praying for a surrender of such charter, an election shall be held to
determine whether or not the same shall be surrendered; provided, that in case
of a failure to surrender such charter, the election shall not be held more
frequently than at two-year intervals thereafter. For a four-year period after
the first board of commissioners shall take office, the cost of calling and
holding such an election shall be borne by those petitioning therefor if such
election does not result in a surrender of this form of charter. Should such
election, however, result in a surrender, the cost of such election shall be
borne by the city and following the expiration of such four-year period the

day following the date of such election unless it falls upon a Sunday, in which
case it shall terminate at one (1) minute past midnight (12:01 a.m.) on the

   (b)   If by law in the case of unincorporated territory another charter may
be adopted by vote of the electors, the question as to whether or not such
other form of charter shall be adopted may be placed upon the ballot to be used

charter.
In case of a reversion to a former form of charter or adoption of a new one
simultaneously with the surrender of the old, all assets, liabilities and
obligations of such city shall become assets, liabilities and obligations of
the new municipality, and in the event that a city shall revert to an
unincorporated status, the governing body of such city thereupon shall become
trustees of the property and funds of such former city and, under such bonds as
may be required by the county legislative body, shall proceed to terminate the

purpose of meeting such current deficit. The trustees shall terminate the
affairs of the city as soon as possible, but in no event shall the trusteeship
continue for more than thirty-six (36) months. Any matters, including
obligations maturing after thirty-six (36) months, not disposed of within the
period designated in this section shall become the responsibility of the county
legislative body of the county wherein the city was located.

generated within the newly incorporated area, until July 1 following the
incorporation, unless the incorporation takes effect on July 1.
   (b)   If the incorporation takes effect on July 1, then the municipality
shall begin receiving revenue from such taxes generated within its corporate
boundaries for the period beginning July 1.
   (c)   Whenever a municipality incorporates, the municipality shall notify

6-19-102. Enumeration of powers not exclusive.
The enumeration of particular powers in this charter is not exclusive of
others, nor restrictive of general words or phrases granting powers, nor shall
a grant or failure to grant power in this chapter impair a power granted in any
other part of this charter, and whether powers, objects, or purposes are
expressed, conjunctively or disjunctively, they shall be construed so as to
permit the city to exercise freely any one (1) or more such powers as to any
one (1) or more such objects for any one (1) or more such purposes.

(orig. ed.), § 6-1903.]
6-19-104. Purchasing and contract procedures.
   (a)   The city manager shall be responsible for all city purchasing, but the
city manager may delegate the duty to make purchases to any subordinate
appointed by the city manager.
   (b)   Competitive prices for all purchases and public improvements shall be
obtained whenever practicable and in accordance with regulations established by
ordinance, and the purchase made from or the contract awarded to the lowest and
best bidder; provided, that the city may reject any and all bids.
   (c)   Formal sealed bids shall be obtained in all transactions involving the
expenditure of an amount to be set by ordinance. The amount set shall be equal
to or greater than the amount set in chapter 56, part 3 of this title, but may
not be greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The transaction shall be
evidenced by written contract. In cases where the board indicates by unanimous
resolution of those present at the meeting, based upon the written
recommendation of the manager, that it is clearly to the advantage of the city
not to contract with competitive bidding, it may authorize noncompetitive
contracts.
   (d)   The city manager may reject all bids and authorize the making of
public improvements or accomplishment of any other city work by any city
department.
   (e)   Purchasing and contract procedures not prescribed by this charter or
other law may be established by ordinance.
   (f)   The board of commissioners may by ordinance delegate to the city
manager the authority to enter into binding contracts on behalf of the city,
without specific board approval, in routine matters and matters having
insubstantial long-term consequences. The ordinance shall enumerate the types
of matters to which the city manager's authority extends and may place other
limitations on the city manager's authority under this subsection (f). As used
in this subsection (f), "routine matters and matters having insubstantial long-
term consequences" means any contract for which expenditures during the fiscal
year will be less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000).

supplement to, any retirement or other employee welfare benefits otherwise
provided by law.

Part 1--Election of Commissioners
6-20-101. Number and terms of commissioners-Election by districts.
   (a)   In all cities that adopt the provisions of chapters 18-22 of this
title, commissioners as provided for in this charter shall be elected in the
manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (b)   If such city or territory has a population of five thousand (5,000) or
more according to the last federal census, there shall be elected at the first
election five (5) commissioners, the three (3) receiving the highest number of
votes to hold office for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2)
years. If such city or territory has a population of less than five thousand
(5,000) according to the last federal census, there shall be elected at the
first election three (3) commissioners, the two (2) receiving the highest
number of votes to hold office for four (4) years and the third for two (2)
years. The term of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4)
years, or until their successors are elected and qualified. Any such city that
has a population of not less than two thousand nine hundred twenty (2,920) nor
more than two thousand nine hundred twenty-two (2,922), according to the
federal census of 1960 or any subsequent federal census, five (5) commissioners
shall be elected as provided for cities of more than five thousand (5,000)
population. The deadline for filing nominating petitions for the first
commissioners is thirty-five (35) days before the incorporation election.
   (c)   Any city having a population of less than five thousand (5,000) shall
have the option of increasing the number of commissioners to five (5) by
ordinance. In the next regular city election after the adoption of such an
ordinance, voters shall be entitled to vote for three (3) commissioners, or
four (4) commissioners, as the case may be, and at the same election the
approval of the ordinance shall also be submitted to the voters. If a majority
of those voting on the ordinance shall be for approval and the number of
commissioners to be elected is three (3), the two (2) receiving the highest
number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the third for two (2)
years. If the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4), the two (2)
receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and
the other two (2) for two (2) years. The terms of all commissioners thereafter
elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and
qualified. If a majority of those voting on the ordinance shall not be for
approval, the ordinance shall be null and void, and the results of the election
shall be certified as though the election were for one (1) commissioner, or two
(2) commissioners, as the case may be, and as though no ordinance had been
adopted. Any city that has previously adopted an ordinance approved by the
voters pursuant to this subsection (c) increasing the number of commissioners
from three (3) to five (5), may, after six (6) years, adopt an ordinance to
decrease the number of commissioners from five (5) to three (3) following the
same procedure. If a majority of those persons voting on the ordinance shall be
for approval, then the number of commissioners shall be reduced to three (3).
Any such ordinance providing for a decrease in the number of commissioners
shall not operate to abbreviate the term of office of any elected commissioner.
   (d)   An ordinance increasing the number of commissioners to five (5) may
also be submitted to the voters in an election on the question that the board
of commissioners directs the county election commission to hold. At such
election, voters shall be entitled to vote for two (2) commissioners to serve
until the next regular city election. If a majority of those voting on the
ordinance shall be for approval, the two (2) candidates for commissioner
receiving the highest number of votes shall be declared elected. At the next
regular city election if the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4),
the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four
(4) years, and the fourth for two (2) years; if the number of commissioners to
be elected is three (3), they shall hold office for four (4) years. The terms
of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until
their successors are elected and qualified. If a majority of those voting on
the ordinance in the special election shall not be for approval, the ordinance
and the election of the two (2) commissioners shall be null and void.
   (e)   Notwithstanding subsections (a)-(d), a city with a population of not
less than six hundred (600) nor more than six hundred twenty-five (625)
persons, according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census,
located in a county with a population in excess of seven hundred thousand
(700,000) persons, also according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent
federal census, shall elect all commissioners at one time for a four-year term
so that the city may be spared the expense of conducting elections every two
(2) years. In order to effectuate this provision, all commissioners to be
elected at the 1983 election shall be elected to a two-year term only, to serve
until the 1985 election at which time, and every four (4) years thereafter, all
commissioners shall be elected to four-year terms. Subsection (e) shall have no
effect unless approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the governing body of any
municipality to which it may apply.
   (f)   Cities that have adopted § 6-20-201(a)(3) to provide for popular
election of the mayor shall have two (2) or four (4) commissioners as the case
may be under subsection (b) or (c).
   (g)   Notwithstanding subsections (a)-(f), any city incorporated under or
adopting this charter may, by ordinance, choose to elect the members of the
board of commissioners by district. If the board chooses to elect commissioners
by district, the board shall by ordinance create contiguous single-member
districts equal to the number of commissioners. The districts shall be
equitably apportioned according to population. The establishment of the
districts and the fixing of their boundaries shall be accomplished not less
than twelve (12) months prior to the regular city election at which
commissioners are to be elected, and any change in district boundaries shall
also be accomplished within this time limitation. The board shall, within ten
(10) years from the initial establishment of districts and at least once in
every ten (10) years thereafter, reapportion the districts so that the
apportionment shall comply with the requirements of this section. One (1)
commissioner shall be elected from each district of the city. The ordinance
providing that the commissioners will be chosen by districts may provide that
each district commissioner will be elected by the voters of the city at-large
or by only the voters of the district. A person must reside in a district to
run for or hold the office of commissioner from that district. The ordinance
providing that commissioners will be chosen by district may also provide for
transition provisions, including increasing the terms of the number of
commissioners necessary so that the initial election from all districts shall
take place at the same time. The ordinance may provide that all commissioners
initially elected serve four-year terms or that some serve four (4) years and
some serve two (2) years. If some are elected for two (2) years, their
successors shall be elected for four (4) years, so that the commissioners have
staggered terms. After the initial election, all commissioners shall be elected
for four-year terms.
   (h)   Any city having a population of more than twenty thousand (20,000),
according to the last federal census, shall have the option of increasing the
number of commissioners to seven (7) by ordinance. Upon adoption of such an
ordinance, it shall be filed with the county election commission, which shall
submit approval of the ordinance to the voters of the city at the next general
election or regular city election that follows the filing period required
pursuant to § 2-3-204(b). If a majority of those voting on the ordinance are
not for approval, the ordinance shall be null and void. If a majority of those
voting on the ordinance are for approval, then at the next regular city
election, voters shall be entitled to vote for four (4) commissioners, or five
(5) commissioners, as the case may be, in order to provide for a total of seven
(7) commissioners. If the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4),
each shall hold office for four (4) years. If the number of commissioners to be
elected is five (5), the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes shall
hold office for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2) years. The
terms of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or
until their successors are elected and qualified. An ordinance approved by the
voters pursuant to this section may not be repealed or amended.
   (i)   (1) In elections of commissioners in a city having a population of not
less than five thousand seven hundred sixty (5,760) nor more than five thousand
eight hundred eighty (5,880) which is located inside a county having a
population of not less than eighty-nine thousand eight hundred (89,800) nor
more than eighty-nine thousand nine hundred (89,900) according to the 2010
federal census or any subsequent federal census, commission positions shall be
designated as Seat A, Seat B, Seat C, Seat D, or Seat E. Any candidate for the
commission shall designate, upon qualifying for election, the particular
designated seat that the candidate seeks. In each regular city election, all
voters in the city may vote for one (1) candidate for each designated seat that
is open by reason of the expiration of a commissioner's term.

6-20-102. Date of elections.
   (a)   The first election of commissioners in any city under chapters 18-22
of this title shall be held on the fourth Tuesday following the election at
which the provisions of these chapters have been adopted. The board of
commissioners shall fix the date of all subsequent elections; provided, that
any date so designated shall fall within ninety (90) days of the annual
anniversary of the first election of the board of commissioners.
   (b)   In any city having a population of not less than three hundred
seventy-five (375) nor more than four hundred twenty-five (425), in any county
having a population of not less than twenty-eight thousand (28,000) nor more
than twenty-eight thousand one hundred (28,100), all according to the 1970
federal census or any subsequent federal census, the board of commissioners
shall fix the date of all subsequent elections; provided, that any date so
designated shall be set at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the
date such election is to be held. The presiding officer of the board of
commissioners shall certify such election date, or any subsequent change
thereto, to the secretary of state.
   (c)   (1) The board of commissioners may by ordinance change the date of
municipal elections to coincide with the August or November general election.
The ordinance changing the election date shall provide for the extension of the
terms of members of the board necessary to meet the election date, but no term
may be extended for more than two (2) years beyond its regular expiration date.
      (2)   Nothing in subdivision (c)(1) shall be construed to remove any
incumbent from office or abridge the term of any incumbent prior to the end of
the term for which an elected official was selected.
      (3)   If the board of commissioners changes the date of municipal
elections pursuant to subdivision (c)(1), the board may at a later date change
the election date back to what such date was prior to moving the election date
to coincide with the August or November general election. The board may only
make an election date change under this subdivision (c)(3) one (1) time. Terms
of incumbent members of the board shall not be abridged to accomplish an
election date change under this subsection (c); however members elected at a
date change pursuant to this subsection (c) may take office at a later date so
as to not abridge terms of incumbent members. If such members take office at a
later date, their term may be abridged due to such members having to take
office at the later date.
   (d)   (1) In addition to the authority granted by subsections (a), (b) and
(c), the board of commissioners of any municipality incorporated under the
general laws of this state and having a population of not less than four
hundred fifty (450) nor more than four hundred sixty (460), or not less than
four hundred eight-five (485) nor more than four hundred ninety-four (494),

thousand two hundred (51,200) nor more than fifty-one thousand three hundred
(51,300), all according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal
census, may, by an ordinance approved by an affirmative two-thirds (2/3) vote
of its membership, fix the date of subsequent regular municipal elections as
the date of the regular November election as defined in § 2-1-104, by one (1)
of the following alternative methods specified in the ordinance:
         (A)   The terms of office of the incumbent members of the board of
commissioners and popularly-elected mayor, if there is one, that would have
expired on the date of the first regular municipal election occurring after the
adoption of the ordinance shall be extended to the date of the regular state
November election occurring thereafter. The terms of office of the incumbent
members of the board of commissioners and popularly-elected mayor, if there is
one, that would have expired on the date of the second regular municipal
election occurring after the adoption of the ordinance shall be extended to the
date of the regular state November election occurring thereafter; or
         (B)   The terms of incumbent members of the board of commissioners,
and the popularly-elected mayor, if there is one, that expire six (6) months or
less before a regular state November election, shall be extended to the date of
that state election. The terms of members of the board of commissioners and the
popularly-elected mayor, if there is one, that expire more than six (6) months
before a regular state November election shall be filled at the regular city
election pertinent to those offices for terms extending to the next regular
state November election.
      (2)   Members of the board of commissioners, and the popularly-elected
mayor, if there is one, shall be elected for terms of four (4) years, except
for the transitional term provided for in subdivision (d)(1)(B).
      (3)   Nothing in this subsection (d) shall be construed to remove any
incumbent from office or abridge the term of any incumbent prior to the end of
the term for which an elected official was selected.

deny the request in writing as provided in 1-604, A.2.b using the Public

that a records production schedule will be provided as expeditiously as
practicable. If appropriate, the records custodian should contact the requestor

1-1102.    Enforcement.
The City Manager of the City of Paris or the City Manager's designee shall be

"traveler" or "authorized traveler" means any elected or appointed municipal
officer or employee, including members of municipal boards and committees
appointed by the Mayor or the municipal governing body, and the employees of
such boards and committees who are traveling on official municipal business and
whose travel was authorized in accordance with this ordinance. "Authorized
traveler" shall not include the spouse, children, other relatives, friends, or
companions accompanying the authorized traveler on city business, unless the
person(s) otherwise qualifies as an authorized traveler under this ordinance.
   B.   Authorized travelers are entitled to reimbursement of certain
expenditures incurred while traveling on official business for the City.
Reimbursable expenses shall include expenses for transportation; lodging,
meals, registration fees for conferences, conventions, and seminars; and other
actual and necessary expenses related to official business as determined by the
City Manager. Under certain conditions, entertainment expenses may be eligible
for reimbursement.
   C.   Authorized travelers can request either a travel advance for the
projected cost of authorized travel, or advance billing directly to the City
for registration fees, air fares, meals, lodging, conferences and similar
expenses. Travel advance requests aren't considered documentation of travel
expenses. If travel advances exceed documented expenses, the traveler must
immediately reimburse the City. It will be the responsibility of the City
Manager to initiate action to recover any undocumented travel advances.
   D.   Travel advances are available only for special travel and only after
completion and approval of the travel authorization form.
   E.   The travel expense reimbursement form will be used to document all
expense claims.
   F.   To qualify for reimbursement, travel expenses must be:
   1.   Directed related to the conduct of the city business for which travel
was authorized, and
   2.   Actual, reasonable, and necessary under the circumstances. The City
Manager may make exceptions for unusual circumstances. Expenses considered
excessive won't be allowed.
   G.   Claims of $5.00 or more for travel expense reimbursement must be
supported by the original paid receipt for lodging, vehicle rental, phone call,
public carrier, travel, conference fee, and other reimbursable costs.
   H.   Any person attempting to defraud the city or misuse the city travel
funds is subject to legal action for recovery of fraudulent travel claims and/
or advances. In addition to any legal action by the City of Paris, disciplinary
procedures under the Personnel Rules and Regulations of the City of Paris,
where applicable, may be used by the City Manager as a cumulative remedy.
   I.   Mileage and motel expenses incurred within the City aren't ordinarily
considered eligible expenses for reimbursement (Ord. #838, 08/05/93).
1-1104.    Travel Reimbursement Rate Schedules.
Authorized travelers shall be reimbursed according to the United States
Government travel regulations rates. The city's travel reimbursement rates will
automatically change when the United States Government rates are adjusted. The
municipality may pay directly to the provider for expenses such as meals,
lodging, and registration fees for conferences, conventions, seminars, and
other education programs (Ord. #838, 08/05/93).
1-1105.    Administrative Procedures.

1-1403.   Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote.
An official with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during

before the exercise of the discretion when possible. In addition, the official

than the municipality:
   For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of an act,
that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or
   That might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence his
discretion, or reward him for past exercise of discretion, in executing
municipal business.
(Ord. #1303, 5/2/2024)
1-1406.   Use of information.
An official or employee may not disclose any information obtained in his

(Ord. #1303, 5/2/2024)
1-1409.   Outside employment.

municipal position or conflicts with any provision of the municipality’s
charter or any ordinance or policy.
(Ord. #1303, 5/2/2024)
1-1410.   Ethics complaints.
The city attorney is designated as the ethics officer of the municipality. Upon
the written request of an official or employee potentially affected by a
provision of this chapter, the city attorney may render an oral or written
advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter and other applicable law.
Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city attorney shall
investigate any credible complaint against an appointed official or employee
charging any violation of this chapter, or may undertake an investigation on
his own initiative when he acquires information indicating a possible violation
and make recommendations for action to end or seek retribution for any activity
that, in the attorney’s judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of
ethics.
The city attorney may request that the governing body hire another attorney,
individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has or will have a
conflict of interests in a particular matter.
When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this chapter is lodged
against a member of the municipality’s governing body, the governing body shall
either determine that the complaint has merit, determine that the complaint
does not have merit, or determine that the complaint has sufficient merit to
warrant further investigation. If the governing body determines that a
complaint warrants further investigation, it shall authorize an investigation
by the city attorney or another individual or entity chosen by the governing
body.
The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances would apply
shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation of a
personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel
or civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics.
(Ord. #1303, 5/2/2024)
1-1411. Violations. 
An elected official or appointed member of a separate municipal board,
commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other instrumentality who
violates any provision of this chapter is subject to punishment as provided by
the municipality’s charter or other applicable law and, in addition, is subject
to censure by the governing body. An appointed official or an employee who
violates any provision of this chapter is subject to disciplinary action.

hearing is to be held, including a reference to the particular sections of the
statutes and rules involved.

alleged violator must make a written request for the hearing to the hearing
officer within seven (7) business days of receipt of the notice required in
subsection (c).
   (e)   If an alleged violator demonstrates to the issuing officer's

to the issuing officer's satisfaction, the fine levied pursuant to subsection
(a) shall not be imposed or if already imposed cease; and the hearing date, if
the hearing has not yet occurred, shall be cancelled.

the default.

communication.
   (b)   Notwithstanding subsection (a), an administrative hearing officer may
communicate with municipal employees or officials regarding a matter pending
before the administrative body or may receive aid from staff assistants,
members of the staff of the city attorney or a licensed attorney, if such
persons do not receive ex parte communications of a type that the
administrative hearing officer would be prohibited from receiving, and do not
furnish, augment, diminish or modify the evidence in the record.
   (c)   Unless required for the disposition of ex parte matters specifically
authorized by statute, no party to a contested case, and no other person may
communicate, directly or indirectly, in connection with any issue in that
proceeding, while the proceeding is pending, with any person serving as an
administrative hearing officer without notice and opportunity for all parties
to participate in the communication.

case, a person receives an ex parte communication of a type that may not
properly be received while serving, the person, promptly after starting to
serve, shall disclose the communication in the manner prescribed in subsection
(e).
   (e)   An administrative hearing officer who receives an ex parte
communication in violation of this section shall place on the record of the
pending matter all written communications received, all written responses to
the communications, and a memorandum stating the substance of all oral

those not disposed of by admissions or agreements of the parties. Such order
when entered controls the subsequent course of the action, unless modified at
the hearing to prevent manifest injustice.
   (b)   Upon reasonable notice to all parties, the administrative hearing
officer may convene a hearing or convert a pre-hearing conference to a hearing,
to be conducted by the administrative hearing officer sitting alone, to

justice and the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings shall not be
impaired by allowing the intervention.

on the lot and indicating thereon the distance in feet that the water line is
located from the rear property line, nearest side property line, principal
building, and any easements on the property.
   (2)   To protect neighboring properties and waterways from stormwater
runoff, erosion and sediment must be controlled during the construction of the
swimming pool. This includes the installation and maintenance of silt fences
and other erosion control measures.
   (3)   Property improvements, including swimming pools, should not alter the
natural or designed flow of lot drainage by increasing the velocity or
concentrated flow of storm water runoff, nor create in any way a negative
impact on adjoining property. Any damage resulting as a result of such actions
is the responsibility of the offending property owner.
   (4)   If the Building Inspector of the City of Paris deems it necessary, a
complete set of engineering plans, including a drainage plan with the
stormwater drainage pipes, including size and capacity, shall be furnished
before a permit is issued.
   (5)   Permit applications shall be processed by the Building Inspector of
the City of Paris or the Building Inspector's designee to ensure that the

(Ord. #1302, 02/01/2024)
4-603.   Private Swimming Pools.
   A.   General
   1.   All residential, non-commercial, private swimming pools, hot tubs and
spas shall be installed and maintained in compliance with all applicable
building and technical codes adopted by the City of Paris, the Henry County
Health Department and the Tennessee Department of Health Services.

this section and all other applicable sections of the City of Paris, Tennessee
Municipal Code.
   B.   Barriers
   1.   Private residential swimming pools, hot tubs and spas shall be enclosed
by a fence, wall, building, or combination thereof not less than five (5) feet
or greater than six (6) feet in height. The barrier shall completely enclose
the area so that there is no direct access by small children or unsuspecting
persons. A natural barrier, pool cover, or other protective device approved by
the City of Paris Building Inspector may be used so long as the degree of
protection afforded is equivalent to the enclosure, gate, and latch described
herein. Spas or hot tubs with a safety cover that complies with ASTMF 1346
shall be exempt from these provisions.
   2.   Openings between vertical and horizontal members of barriers shall be
spaced at intervals close enough to prevent passage of a four-inch sphere
through the openings.
   3.   All gates allowing access to the area must be self-latching. The
latches must be placed a minimum of four feet above the underlying ground or
otherwise made inaccessible to small children from the outside. Gates leading
directly to the area must be kept closed at all times unless premise occupants
are in the vicinity of the area and can observe entry to the area through open
gates.
   4.   Barriers, including gates, shall be maintained in good repair at all
times to prevent entry into the area by small children and unsuspecting
persons. If any portion of the barrier or gates become unsatisfactory to
protect against entry into the area, whether caused by general deterioration,
high winds, storms, etc., the barrier shall be repaired as soon as possible.
Pending the permanent repairs, the area shall be protected by an adequate
temporary barrier.
   5.   When the Code Enforcement Officer determines a barrier is deemed
inadequate for protection and the premises owner or occupant fails to secure
the area the Code Enforcement Officer shall give notice as set forth in this
section to the owner of the real estate upon which the violation has occurred.
   C.   Maintenance.
   1.   It shall be the responsibility of the owner and/or the occupant of the
premises to maintain a swimming pool, hot tub, and/or spa in safe, sanitary,
and working condition at all times. Water contained in a swimming pool, hot tub
or spa shall be maintained to a level of clarity that allows for the unaided
visual inspection of the lowest point of the pool, hot tub or spa. Water not
meeting this clarity definition shall be deemed a potential health and safety
hazard, and thus a public nuisance.
   2.   All swimming pools shall be maintained to ensure the disinfection of
all pool water pursuant to applicable health standards under state law and
county ordinance. If disinfection is not maintained, then the owner of the real
property upon which said pool is located shall be notified by United States
mail, return receipt requested, by the Code Enforcement Officer to either:
   A.    Disinfect the swimming pool pursuant to applicable health standards

holding water; or
   (b)    Remove the pool structure; or
   (c)    Cover with a safety cover.
   4.   A pool that remains drained of water for 180 days, not in working
condition, and not covered as provided by subsection (2) above is presumed to
be no longer maintained as a swimming pool. It shall be an affirmative defense
to this subsection that the pool is in the process of actively being brought
into compliance with this Chapter.
   5.   When the City of Paris Code Enforcement Officer finds any pool, hot tub
or spa is not being maintained in accordance with this chapter and presents a
danger to the life, health or safety of any person, then the City of Paris Code
Enforcement Officer shall give notice as set forth in this section to the owner
of the real estate upon which the violation has occurred.

section and the provisions of any applicable Accessory Dwelling Unit Ordinance.
   (3)   Permits for accessory structures are required. Applications for
permits may be obtained from the City Manager or City Manager's designee.
Applications shall be reviewed and approved by the City Manager or the City
Manager's designee prior to issuance of a building permit from the City of
Paris.
   F.   Floodplain and Floodway Areas
   1.    Installation of swimming pools, hot tubs and spas on properties
located in the floodplain areas of the City requires approval of the City of
Paris engineering department prior to approval of a permit application.
   (a)    Pool equipment should be one foot above the base floodplain elevation
using the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Profile.
   (b)   Above ground pools in the floodplain shall be anchored.
   2.   There shall be no swimming pools, hot tubs or spas on property located
in the floodway.
   3.   The following documentation is required prior to the issuance of a

   G.    Drainage of Water
   1.   The water in swimming pools, hot tubs and spas, when it is necessary to
be drained, shall not be drained in a manner that will create a nuisance to
adjoining properties.
   2.   Water accumulating on the top of covers is classified as rainwater.
Rainwater may be drained into the sanitary sewer system or the street storm
drains. It may be drained into the ground surface provided that it does not
cause a nuisance to adjacent property owners. The drainage of rainwater onto
the ground surface that causes, or is claimed to cause, a nuisance to adjacent
property owners is a civil matter to be resolved between the property owners.
   H.   Notification, Violation and Penalty

the City to meet any of the provisions of this chapter, the City shall serve a

service call shall be $3,000.00. In the event this fee is not paid the City of
Paris shall take all necessary legal steps to collect the fee and may place a
lien on the property for which the fire protection service call was made. (Ord.

such payment with the affected party's insurance company. The claim filed shall
be for an amount, as determined by the Fire Chief that represents the actual
costs of the fire call response, not to exceed $3,000.00.

insurance coverage is less than the cost of the fire call, the City may accept
said maximum allowable amount. Provided, further, that if the owner of said
property does not have Fire Department Service Charge Coverage available
through their insurance policy, the City Manager, or the City Manager's
designee, may waive/forgive said claim for payment.
The provisions of this Chapter shall in no way affect or restrict the
application of the provisions of
7-102 of the Paris Municipal Code enacting and implementing the Rural Fire Code
Program. Having Fire Department Service Charge coverage shall not excuse
payment of the Fire Department Subscription Fee required by

waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting
contamination to the public water system as a result of backflow. By-pass
arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over
devices through which, or because of which, backflow could occur are considered
to be cross-connections.

   (6).   Person. Any individual, corporation, company, association,
partnership, state, municipality, utility district, water cooperative, or
Federal agency. (Ord. #708, 04/06/89).

The City of Paris Public Water System is to comply with Sections 68-13-701
through 68-13-719 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, as well as the Rules and
Regulations for Public Water Systems, legally adopted in accordance with this
Code, which pertain to cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, by-passes, and
inter-connections, and establish an effective ongoing program to control these
undesirable water uses (Ord. #708, 04/06/89).
8-304.   Prohibited Conduct; Exemptions.
It shall be unlawful for any person to cause a cross-connection to be made; or
allow one to exist for any purpose whatsoever unless the construction and
operation of same have been approved by the Tennessee Department of Health and
Environment, and the operation of such cross-connection, auxiliary intake, by-
pass or inter-connection is at all times under the direct supervision of the
Superintendent of the Paris Board of Public Utilities (Ord. #708, 04/06/89).
8-305.   Separate Water Supplies.
Any person whose premises are supplied with water from the public water supply,
and who also has on the same premises a separate source of water supply or
stores water in an uncovered or unsanitary storage reservoir from which the
water stored therein is circulated through a piping system, shall file with the
Superintendent of the Paris Board of Public Utilities a statement of the
nonexistence of unapproved or unauthorized cross-connections, auxiliary
intakes, by-passes, or inter-connections. Such statement shall also contain an
agreement that no cross-connection, auxiliary intake, by-pass, or inter-
connection will be permitted upon the premises (Ord. #708, 04/06/89).
8-306.   Inspections.
It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of the Paris Board of Public
Utilities to cause inspections to be made of all properties served by the

representative shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time, any
property served by a connection to the Public Water System for the purpose of
inspecting the piping system or systems therein for cross-connections,
auxiliary intakes, by-passes or inter-connections. On request, the owner,
lessee, or occupant or any property so served shall furnish to the inspection
agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such
property. The refusal of such information or refusal of access, when requested,
shall be deemed evidence of the presence of cross-connections (Ord. #708, 04/
06/89).
8-308.   Compliance.
Any person who now has cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, by-passes, or
inter-connections in violation of the provisions of this ordinance shall be
allowed a reasonable time within which to comply with provisions of this
ordinance. After a thorough investigation of existing conditions and an
appraisal of time required to complete the work, the amount of time shall be
designated by the Superintendent of the Paris Board of Public Utilities.
The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water
system as prohibited by this ordinance and the Tennessee Code Annotated,
Section 68-13-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by
the Paris Board of Public Utilities, shall be grounds for denial of water
service. If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time,
the utility shall give the customer legal notification that water service is to
be discontinued, and physically separate the public water system from the
customer's on-site piping system in such a manner that the two systems cannot
again be connected by an unauthorized person.
Where cross-connections, inter-connections, auxiliary intakes, or by-passes are
found that constitutes an extreme hazard of immediate concerning of
contaminating the public water system, the management of the water system shall
require that immediate correction action be taken to eliminate the threat to
the public water system. Immediate steps shall be taken to disconnect the
public water system from the on-site piping system unless the imminent hazard
(s) is corrected immediately (Ord. #708, 04/06/89).
8-309.   Protective Devices.
Where the nature of use of the water supplied a premises by the water system is

   (a)   Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation.
   (b)   That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot, or is not
willing, to demonstrate to the official in charge of the water system, his
designated representative, that the water use and protective features of the
plumbing are such as to propose no threat to the safety or portability of the
water system;
   (c)   That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such that
frequent alterations are made to the plumbing;
   (d)   There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted,
altered, or disconnected.
The Superintendent of the Paris Board of Public Utilities, or his designated
representative, shall require the use of an approved protective device on the
service line serving the premises to assure that any contamination that may
originate in the customer's premises is contained herein. The protective
devices shall be reduced pressure zone type backflow preventer approved by the
Tennessee Department of Health and Environment as to manufacturer, model, and
size. The method of installation of backflow protective devices shall be
approved by the Superintendent of the Paris Board of Public Utilities prior to
installation and shall comply with the criteria set forth by the Tennessee
Department of Health and Environment. The installation shall be at the expense
of the owner or occupant of the premises.
Personnel of the Paris Board of Public Utilities shall have the right to
inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed
necessary by the Superintendent of the Paris Board of Public Utilities, or his
designated representative. Water service shall not be disrupted to test the
device without the knowledge of the occupant of the premise.
   Testing of Devices: Customers required to install a backflow prevention
device are responsible for having the device tested annually by a qualified
person possessing a valid certification from the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation, Division of Water Supply, for the testing of such
devices. A record of this test must be submitted to the Paris Board of Public
Utilities annually. (Ord. #1130, 09/01/11)
The failure to maintain backflow prevention device(s) in proper working order
shall be grounds for discontinuing water service to a premises. Likewise the
removal, by-passing, or altering the protective device(s) or the installation
thereof so as to render the device(s) ineffective shall constitute grounds for
discontinuance of water service. Water service to such premises shall not be
restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or
defects to the satisfaction of the Paris Board of Public Utilities (Ord. #708,
04/06/89).
8-310.   Warnings.

system be protected from possible contamination as specified herein. Any water
outlet which could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not
supplied by the potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:
WATER UNSAFE FOR DRINKING
(Ord. #708, 04/06/89).
8-311.   Enforcement.
The requirements contained herein shall apply to all premises served by the
Paris Board of Public Utilities whether located inside or outside the corporate
limits and are hereby made a part of the conditions required to be met for the
City to provide water services to any premises. Such action, being essential
for the protection of water distribution system against the entrance of
contamination which may render the water unsafe healthwise, or otherwise
undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly without regard to location of the
premises, whether inside or outside the City of Paris corporate limits (Ord.
#708, 04/06/89).
8-312.   Penalties.
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this
ordinance shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
therefore, shall be fined not less than Ten Dollars ($10.00) nor more than One
Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and each day of continued violation after conviction
shall constitute a separate offense (Ord. #708, 04/06/89).
8-313.   Severability.
Should any part(s) or this ordinance be declared invalid for any reason, no
other part(s) of this ordinance shall be affected thereby (Ord. #708, 04/06/
89).

to conduct or operate or cause to be rented either as owner, agent, manager, or
lessee, within the city, any rental units used for human habitation without
first having obtained a license or temporary certificate to do so as
hereinafter provided. A rental unit is a family occupancy in a single
residential accommodation, which is arranged, designed, used for, or intended
for use a s single family dwelling, duplex, triplex, quadruplex, apartment
complex, individual apartment, or sleeping room located in an area zoned as
residential or B-2 (Central Business District) under the provisions of Title
11-101; et seq. of the Paris Municipal Code. This ordinance shall not apply to
hotels; motels; hospitals; nursing homes; or other rental units used for human
habitation, which offer or provide medical or nursing services, if such units
are subject to state or federal licensing or regulations concerning safety of
the users, patients or tenants.
8-402.   Application.
Within ninety (90) days after the effective date of this ordinance, the owner
of each rental dwelling unit existing on the effective date of this section
shall make written application to the building inspector for a license for such
use on a form to be provided by the City of Paris, and containing such
information as necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of, and
insure compliance with, the provisions of this ordinance and all of the
building, housing, and utility codes of the City of Paris as provided under the
provisions of title 4 of the Paris Municipal Code. The legal owner of record of
each rental unit, as hereinbefore defined, constructed after the effective date
of this ordinance shall make written application to the building inspector for
a license as hereinabove provided prior to any initial occupancy.
8-403.   Temporary Certificate.
Upon receipt of a completed application for a license, with tender of the
appropriate license and inspection fee as hereinafter provided, the building
inspector shall issue a "temporary certificate" indicating that a license has
been duly applied for, and that such license will be issued or denied after the
rental unit has been inspected for compliance with the provisions of this
ordinance. A temporary certificate shall authorize continued occupancy of such
dwelling and actual existence and use on the effective date of this ordinance,
pending the issuance or denial of the applied for license. Structures to be
converted to rental usage after the effective date of this section shall not be
occupied for human habitation prior to the issuance of a license. In any event,
however, the provisions of this section shall have no further force and effect
on and after December 31, 1993.

Code, have been met, a license certifying such fact shall be issued. If the
building inspector finds that the requirements of those provisions of Title 4
and Title 11 have not been met, a written denial specifying the defect shall be
transmitted to the applicant. When a license has been denied, expired,
suspended or revoked, no further rental or occupancy of the dwelling unit or
units then vacant or which may become vacant shall be permitted until a license
has been issued. The units within a structure which are in compliance with the
provisions of Title 4 may continue to be occupied if units and other portions
of the structure which do not comply do not create a hazard to the health and
safety to the persons in the occupied units.
8-405.   Renewal of License.
Unless sooner revoked or suspended for cause, each license shall expire on
January 31 of each odd numbered year and may be renewed for two (2) year
periods thereafter. A license issued hereunder is transferable for a fee of Ten
Dollars ($10.00) to any person who has acquired ownership of the licensed
building for the unexpired portion of the two (2) year term for which it was
issued or reissued, provided that the application to transfer such licenses as
filed with the building inspector for change of ownership and the license,
building, and dwelling units are in compliance with the housing code. A license
shall terminate upon failure to apply for its transfer within thirty (30) days
of the date of sale or transfer of ownership of the building.
8-406.   Enforcement and Inspection.
The building inspector shall enforce the provisions of this ordinance and is
hereby authorized to make inspections on a scheduled basis or when reason
exists to believe the violations of this ordinance has been or is being
committed. Provided, however, that the electrical inspection required under the
provisions of this ordinance shall be conducted in such manner as is provided

409 hereinbelow, and the licensed inspector designated in 4-306 shall make a
report of findings to the Building Inspector to enforce compliance with
provisions of this ordinance. If any owner, occupant, or other person in charge
of a building or rental unit fails or refuses to permit free access and entry
to the structure or premises under that person's control for any inspection
pursuant to this ordinance, the building inspector may seek an appropriate
court order authorizing such inspection (Ord. #827, 06/03/93).
8-407.   Notice of Violation.

rooming unit, or the premises surrounding any of these, fails to meet the
requirements set forth in this ordinance, or those other ordinances or code
sections as adopted by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Paris,
Tennessee, where applicable, the building inspector shall issue a notice

and protect the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and
other aspects of the general welfare. These general goals include, among other,
the following more specific objectives.

Comprehensive Community Development Plan and other applicable development
standards.
   B.   To protect and strengthen the character of established viable
neighborhoods using public and private resources:
   C.   To encourage the development of neighborhoods which are protected from
through traffic, buffered from incompatible development, and served by adequate
neighborhood facilities.
   D.   To maintain and preserve the existing housing supply of the community
through concentrated code enforcement.
   E.   To provide appropriate space for public and private educational,
religious, recreational, an similar facilities and public utilities which

   F.   To provide an overall framework which encourages freedom of design in
the development of residential subdivisions and individual housing units.
11-401.   Schedule of Residential District Regulations.
The tabulation of regulations governing the permitted uses and area and bulk
regulations for each residential district, in the City of Paris, is as
indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 of this ordinance.
11-402.   R-1 Residential District.
Within the R-1 district as shown on the Official Zoning Map of Paris,
Tennessee, the following regulations shall apply:
   A.   Intent. The R-1 single family residential district is intended to be
the most restrictive of the residential districts. It is the specific intent of
this ordinance to exclude mobile homes within this district. The intent is to
allow predominantly single-family detached dwellings in suitable residential
areas characterized by an open appearance and low population densities. The R-
1 district is intended to be defined and protected from the encroachment of
non-residential uses including buildings or other structures and uses having
commercial characteristics or other environmentally unsound or incompatible
uses. Internal stability, attractiveness, order, and efficiency are encouraged
by providing for adequate light, air, and open space for dwellings and related
facilities.
   B.   Principal Uses and Structures Permitted by Right. The uses permitted by
right in this district are indicated in Table 1 and as follows: Single-family
Detached Dwellings, Zero Lot Line Developments.
   C.   Principal Uses and Structures Permitted Subject to Special Conditions.
The uses permitted as conditional uses or special permit uses in this district
are indicated in Table 1 and are subject to the applicable procedures and
standards set forth in Section
11-800 and Section
11-900.
Special Permit Uses. Are as follows: Cemetery-Mausoleum, Church, Public or
Private School (K-12), Public or Private Museum, Water Storage Tanks.
   D.   Permitted Accessory Uses and Structures. Accessory buildings or uses
customarily incidental to any principal permitted use as set forth in Section
11-1500.

   F.   Area and Bulk Regulations. The regulations governing the minimum lot
area and width required yards, and maximum lot coverage by all buildings in
this district are set forth in Table 2. Three different types of R-
1 development are provided for in Table 2 based on the density allowed in the
specific districts. The different density levels are intended to allow future
development compatible with the immediate neighborhood. It is the specific
intent of this Ordinance that the Paris Municipal Regional Planning Commission
shall recommend amendments to change the boundary lines within the R-1, R-2,
and R-3 Districts as low density, medium density, and high density to the Board
of Commissioners of the City of Paris, Tennessee. (Ord. # 1029, 05/06/04; Ord.

subject to the conditions in this section:
   A.   Intent. The regulations established in this section are intended to
provide optional methods of residential development by which tracts of land may
be developed through an overall unified approach rather than the conventional
single lot development permitted in existing residential districts in this
ordinance. The type of residential development permitted in this section is
characterized by a unified building and site plan which allows the maximum use
of open space and maximum provisions for religious, education, and cultural
facilities which are integrated with the total development.

requirement from the periphery boundary of the development of not less than
twenty-five (25) feet, with two (2) feet additional for each floor above two.
   3.   Dimensional and Bulk Standards.
   (a)   The minimum lot area, width, frontage, and yard requirements otherwise
applying to individual buildings in the zone in which a group housing
development is proposed does not apply within a group housing development.
   (b)   If the spacing between main buildings is not equivalent to the spacing
which would be required between buildings similarly developed under this
ordinance on separate parcels, other design features shall provide light,
ventilation, and other characteristics equivalent to that obtained from the
spacing standards.
   (c)   Buildings, off-street parking and loading facilities, open space,
landscaping, and screening shall provide protection outside the boundary lines
of the development comparable to that otherwise required of development in the
zone.
   (d)   The building coverage for any group housing development shall not
exceed that which is permitted for construction in the zone.
   D.   Permitted Density.
   1.   The Group Housing Development may result in a density in excess of the
density otherwise permitted within the zone in which the development is to be
constructed not to exceed five percent.
   2.   An increase in density of over five percent but less than 10 percent
can be permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals if the arrangement of yards and
common open space is found to provide superior protection to existing or future
development on adjacent property.
   3.   If the Planning Commission finds that any of the following conditions
would be created by an increase in density permitted by this section, it may
either prohibit any increase in density permitted by this section, or limit the
increased density by an amount which is sufficient to avoid the creation of any
of these conditions.
   (a)   Inconvenient or unsafe access to the planned unit development.
   (b)   Traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the group housing
development.
   (c)   An excessive burden on sewerage, water supply, parks, recreational
areas, schools or other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve
the development.
   4.   For Group Housing Development which is proposed to be constructed in
stages, the Planning Commission may limit the number of dwelling units which
may be located within each stage of the development, thereby insuring that
should other stages fail to be constructed, the density permitted in early
stages of the development will not exceed the density permitted for the entire
development.
   E.   Common Open Space.
   1.   No open area may be accepted as common open space within a group
housing development unless it meets the following requirements:
   (a)   The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space is
suitable for the development. Within any yard setback or area between
buildings, an area equivalent to seventy (70) percent of any required yard or
any required minimum area between buildings must be suitably landscaped and
developed as usable open space or recreational area available to the residents
of the development. These areas shall be kept free of all vehicular uses and
shall not be used for off-street parking areas.
   (b)   The common open space is for amenity or recreational purposes and the
uses authorized are appropriate to the scale and character of the development,
considering its size, density, expected population, topography, and the number
and type of dwellings provided.
   (c)   Common open space will be suitably improved for fits intended use,
except that common open space containing natural features worthy of
preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures and improvements
to be permitted in the common open space are appropriate to the uses which are
authorized for the common open space.
   (d)   The development schedule which is part of the development plan
coordinates the improvement of the common open space and the construction of
buildings and other structures in the common open space with the construction
of residential dwellings in the development.
   (e)   If buildings, structures or other improvements are to be made in the
common open space, the developer provides a bond or other adequate assurance
that the buildings, structures and improvements will be completed. The Planning
Commission shall release the bond or other assurances when the buildings,
structures and other improvements have been completed according to the
development plan.
   2.   Land shown on the final development plan as common open space shall be
maintained under one of the following options:
   (a)   To be retained by the developer who agrees to maintain the common open
space and any buildings, structures or other improvements which have been
placed on it. Plans for improvements and maintenance of the common open space
shall be approved by the Planning Commission and restrictive covenants made to
assure continuing use of the land for common open space purposes.

nonprofit corporation under the laws of the state, which shall adopt and impose
articles of incorporation and bylaws and adopt and impose a declaration of
covenants and restrictions on the common open space that is acceptable to the
Planning Commission as providing for the continuing care of the space. Such an
association shall be formed and continued for the purpose of maintaining the
common open space.
   3.   No common open space may be put to a use not specified in the final
development plan unless a final development plan is first amended to permit the
use. However, no change of use may be considered as a waiver of any of the
covenants limiting the use of common open space areas, and all rights to
enforce these covenants against any use permitted are expressly reserved.

maintaining the common open space.
   3.   No common open space may be put to a use not specified in the final
development plan unless the final development plan is first amended to permit
use. However, no change of use may be considered as a waiver of any of the

the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and other aspects
of the general welfare. These general goals include, among others, the
following more specific objectives:
   A.   To locate and develop commercial facilities in conformance with the
Paris Comprehensive Community Development Plan and other applicable development
standards.
   B.   To locate commercial development in areas of high accessibility in
order to serve appropriate trade area functions and in areas where water and
sewer services are presently available or can be easily extended.
   C.   To concentrate commercial development so as to increase sales potential
and reduce traffic congestion and other adverse affects on the surrounding
community.
   D.   To encourage the revitalization and redevelopment of the central city
as a center for government, public administration, and related professional and
support services.
   E.   To maintain and improve existing commercial areas that have good
transportation access and market potential.
   F.   To reserve specific areas for commercial activities to serve as
regional shopping areas, community and commercial centers, and other retail
outlets.

Highway Commercial District includes areas where commercial development has
displaced or is displacing residential development or other vacant lands. The
Highway Commercial District will ordinarily be located along numbered state and
federal highways, or other highways designated as arterial streets.

and related service uses servicing both local and long-distance travelers.
   2.   To provide appropriate space, in sufficient depth from the street, to
satisfy the needs of modern commercial development where access is entirely
dependent on the automobile.
   3.   To discourage the expansion of existing strip commercial areas and to
provide for the concentration of these uses.
   4.   To encourage the development of the district in such a manner as to
minimize traffic hazards and interference from other highway-oriented
businesses by providing adequate access controls and insuring sufficient off-
street parking and loading areas.

11-701.   F-P Floodplain Districts.
ARTICLE I.   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
Section A.   Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Tennessee has in Sections 13-7-201 through 13-
7-210, Tennessee Code Annotated delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Paris,
Tennessee, Mayor and City Commission, do ordain as follows:
Section B.   Findings of Fact
   1.   The City of Paris, Tennessee, Mayor and its Legislative Body wishes to
maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in
order to do so must meet the NFIP regulations found in Title 44 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Ch. 1, Section 60.3.
   2.   Areas of the City of Paris, Tennessee are subject to periodic
inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   3.   Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in
flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
Section C.   Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas. This Ordinance is designed to:
   1.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or erosion
hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or
velocities;
   2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities,
be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
   3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
   5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
Section D.   Objectives
The objectives of this Ordinance are:
   1.   To protect human life, health, safety and property;
   2.   To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control
projects;
   3.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   4.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   5.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodprone areas;
   6.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas to minimize blight in flood areas;
   7.   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a
floodprone area;

   5.   Standards for Subdivisions and Other Proposed New Development Proposals
Subdivisions and other proposed new developments, including manufactured home
parks, shall be reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably
safe from flooding.
   a.   All subdivision and other proposed new development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   b.   All subdivision and other proposed new development proposals shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
   c.   All subdivision and other proposed new development proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   d.   In all approximate A Zones require that all new subdivision proposals
and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home

lesser, include within such proposals Base Flood Elevation data (See Article V,
Section E).
Section C.   Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas with Established Base
Flood Elevations and With Floodways Designated
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III,
Section B, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential.
In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for
the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities.
Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
   1.   Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new
construction, substantial improvements or other development within the
regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed
encroachments or new development shall not result in any increase in the water
surface elevation of the Base Flood Elevation, velocities, or floodway widths
during the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the
community. A Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide supporting
technical data, using the same methodologies as in the effective Flood
Insurance Study for the City of Paris, Tennessee and certification, thereof.
   2.   New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Article V, Sections A and B.
Section D.   Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard Zones AE with
Established Base Flood Elevations but Without Floodways Designated
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III,
Section B, where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no
floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
   1.   No encroachments, including fill material, new construction and
substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard,
unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot
at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be
supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles.
   2.   New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Article V, Sections A and B.
Section E.   Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations
and Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III,
Section B, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and
where a Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
   1.   The Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any Base
Flood Elevation and floodway data available from any Federal, State, or other
sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations (see 2
below), as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development in approximate A Zones meet the requirements
of Article V, Sections A and B.
   2.   Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such
proposals Base Flood Elevation data.
   3.   Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been
established and where such data is not available from other sources, require
the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at
least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Article
II). All applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications
shall be recorded as set forth in Article IV, Section B. Openings sufficient to
facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Article V, Section B.
   4.   Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been
established and where such data is not available from other sources, no
encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within
an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet (20), whichever is
greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a
Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City
of Paris, Tennessee. The engineering certification should be supported by
technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
   5.   New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Article V, Sections A and B. Within approximate A Zones, require that those
subsections of Article V Section B dealing with the alteration or relocation of
a watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and
manufactured homes provisions are complied with as required.
Section F.   Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III,
Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3)
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions, in addition to those set forth in Article V, Sections A and B,
apply:
   1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and
non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to at least one (1) foot above as many feet as the depth number
specified on the FIRM's, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood
depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including basement,
shall be elevated to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of
Article V, Section B.
   2.   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed
watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least one (1) foot above the
flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no
depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to
at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
for meeting the provisions of this Ordinance and shall provide such
certification to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in
accordance with Article IV, Section B.
   3.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
Section G.   Standards For Areas Protected by Flood Protection System (A-99
Zones)
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III,
Section B, are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection
system but where Base Flood Elevations have not been determined. Within these
areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Article IV and Article V shall apply.
Section H.   Standards for Unmapped Streams
Located within the City of Paris, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas
of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such
streams, the following provisions shall apply:
   1.   No encroachments including fill material or other development including
structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width
of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification
by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the
locality.
   2.   When a new flood hazard risk zone, and Base Flood Elevation and
floodway data is available, new construction and substantial improvements shall
meet the standards established in accordance with Articles IV and V.

   A.   Intent. It is the intent of this ordinance to eliminate as home
occupations all uses except those that conform to the standards set forth
herein. Custom and tradition are intentionally excluded as criteria. The
standards for home occupations are intended to ensure compatibility with other
permitted uses and with the residential character of the neighborhood, and as
clearly secondary or incidental status in relation to the residential use of
the premises as the criteria for determining whether a proposed use qualifies
as a home occupation.
Retail sales at the home occupation location is not allowed. No article shall
be sold or offered for sale on the home occupation premises. Any retail items
must be sold off site and delivered or if sold by electronic means such as
telephone, computer, internet, or other electronic means must be delivered off
site.
Examples of typical businesses which would be allowed by Home Occupation
Permits might include typing or drafting services; consulting businesses,
providing all work is picked up from and delivered to the client by the holder
of the permit; landscape maintenance, janitorial services, and contractor
business, where the business is conducted elsewhere and all equipment is either
stored offsite and/or in a vehicle which is to be stored in the garage at the
home occupation residence. Businesses making items on premises such as jewelry,
leather goods, paintings or artwork, or the like, are allowed if such products
are sold offsite or electronically. Home boutiques are not allowed. Occupations
that consist of businesses in which only telephone or mail services are used
are allowed subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Standards for Home Occupations.
   1.   General. The standards set forth below shall be used by the City
Manager or City Manager's designee in evaluating an application for a home
occupation. In evaluating an application for a home occupation, the City of
Paris must insure the following: (1) that the public interest has been
adequately protected; (2) that no change in the character of the surrounding
neighborhood will occur as a result of the home occupation; (3) that no
excessive noise, increased traffic and parking, and odor or hazard will result
from the home occupation; and (4) that the proposed home occupation will not
place a strain or burden on existing public facilities and services,
particularly sewer and water service, street improvements, fire and police
protection, and solid waste collection.
   2.    Performance Standards. Home occupations are permitted as an incidental
and subordinate use in specified residential districts when the applicant

   All towers and accessory structures which are not constructed within a
utility easement shall be set back from the property lines a distance equal to
twenty (20) percent of the tower height or the district yard requirements,
which ever is greater. In instances when a tower and/or accessory structures

construction of the proposed tower and/or accessory structure. In the event
that the appropriate representative is of the opinion that the proposed
placement of the tower and/or accessory structure on or near such utility
easement shall interfere with the utility easement, then the special use permit
for construction of the proposed tower and/or accessory structure shall not be
issued. In instances when a tower and accessory structures are located adjacent
to or within a residential district, either immediately adjacent to such
property or across a public way, the minimum standard setback from residential
lot lines and residential districts shall be equal to fifty (50) percent of the

tenths of a mile due to one of the following reasons:
   1.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of existing
an approved tower.
   2.   The planned equipment would cause radio frequency (RF) interference
with other existing or planned equipment.
   3.   Existing or approved towers do not have space on which planned
equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and reasonably.
   4.   Geographic service requirements prevent co-use of existing towers or
structures.
   b.   The feasibility of the shared use of any proposed tower in the future
shall be addressed at the time of application. As a minimum, a tower shall be
designed for co-location on the initial installation, i.e., the tower will be
designed for two sets of fully sectored antenna arrays. A letter of intent
committing the tower owner and any successive owners to provide for the shared
use of the tower, if an applicant agrees in writing to pay any reasonable
charge for shared use.
   3.   Type

zoned residential, either immediately adjacent to such property or across a
public way, special care shall be taken to minimize the effects on the adjacent
residential areas.
   b.   All ground structures shall be buffered in a manner which consist of a
minimum of four (4) foot wide landscaped strip around the perimeter of the

of the ground structures within the surrounded area. The buffer shall be
installed for the permanent year-round protection of adjacent property by
visually shielding internal activities from adjoining property to a height of
eight (8) feet. The landscaping provisions of this section may be varied or
reduced if the proposed plan provides for unique and innovative landscaping
treatment of physical features that meet the intent and purpose of this
section.
   5.   Height
   a.   No tower shall exceed a height of three hundred and thirty (330) feet.
(Ord. # 975, 01/02/01 ).
   b.   In instances when a tower is to be co-located upon an existing utility
structure, which is defined as an existing power line structure or an existing
water tower the maximum height shall not exceed the height of the structure
plus (+) twenty (20) feet.
   6.   Vehicle Access Control
The location and design of driveways and / or access easements to the facility
from a public street shall be depicted on the site plan and shall be approved
by the Planning Commission in accordance with these regulations.
   7.   Lighting
   a.   Towers: Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the
FAA or other authority for safety purposes. When required, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design
that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding viewing area. "Dual
lighting" (red at night / strobe during the day) shall be preferred unless
restricted by the FAA.
   b.   Structures: outside lighting of structures, if required for safety and
security purposes, shall be of a sensory fashion in which illumination occurs
only when the site is approached. The lighting shall be arranged to minimize
glare and reflection on adjacent residential properties and public streets.
   8.   Security
   The facility shall be fully secured through the installation, around the
perimeter of the compound, of a security fencing system of a minimum of eight
(8) feet, which consist of either high impact vinyl, galvanized chain link, or
pressure treated wood.

applicant shall provide plans and specifications for such tower prepared by a
licensed engineer, certifying to the Board of Zoning Appeals that the proposed
construction will be designed, securely braced, and anchored to resist wind
loads, dead loads, and uplift forces in compliance with generally accepted
engineering standards for a structure of its type. Due allowance shall be made
for the effect of shape of individual elements and height and contour of the
proposed structure.

standards in a. above shall apply with the exception that:
   1.   The maximum heigh shall be limited to 80 feet.

11-1001.   Minimum Off-Street Parking Spaces.
The Planning Commission of the City of Paris has determined that paved parking
areas impact drainage, erosion and aesthetics of the City. Therefore, in an
effort to decrease the amount of land consumed by paved areas, the City of
Paris has adopted a policy of requiring a minimal number of parking spaces.
Developers are encouraged to project individual parking needs based on the
projected use of structures. These regulations are provided simply as a
guideline. Any developer anticipating a greater need for parking than required
in this section should provide the additional parking. In certain instances
involving atypical uses or uses not addressed in this section, the Planning
Commission may require a specific number of parking spaces as part of the site
plan review process.
The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be determined in
accordance with the following table:

11-1002.   Off-Street Parking Space Design, Standards, Construction and
Maintenance.
Whenever the required off-street parking requires the building of a parking
area, and wherever a parking area is built, such off-street parking shall be
designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following
regulations.
11-1003.   Standards for Parking Facilities.
   A.   No parking lot shall be constructed until a permit is issued by the
Building Inspector. Applications for a permit shall be submitted to the
Building Inspector in such form as may be determined by the Building Inspector
and shall be accompanied with two (2)   sets of plans for the development and
construction of the parking lot showing that the provisions of this section
will be fully complied with.
   B.   Each parking space shall be computed at an average of not less than two
hundred (200) square feet in area and shall be a definitely designated stall
adequate for one motor vehicle.
   C.   All spaces shall be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering
lanes. Backing directly onto a street shall be prohibited on arterial streets.
   D.   All maneuvering lane widths shall only permit one-way traffic movement,
except that the 90 degree pattern may permit two-way movement.
   E.   Adequate entrance and exit to the parking lot by means of clearly
limited and defined drives shall be provided for all vehicles. Entrance and
exit to a parking lot lying in an area zoned for other than single family
residential use shall not be across land zoned for single family residential
use.
   F.   Each entrance and exit to and from any off-street parking lot located
in an area zoned for other than single-family residential use shall be at least
twenty (20) feet distant from any adjacent property located in any residential
district.
   G.   The off-street parking area shall be provided with an opaque fence or
wall not less than seven (7) feet in height measured from the surface of the
parking area when the abutting property or lot is zoned in a residential
classification. Such walls shall be subject further to the requirements of
Section
11-1200et seq. When a front yard setback is required, all land between the wall
and the front property line or street right-of-way line shall be kept free from
refuse and debris and shall be suitably landscaped.
   H.   In all cases where a wall extends to an alley which is a means of
ingress and egress to any off-street parking area, it shall be permissible to
end the wall not more than ten (10) feet from such alley line in order to
permit a wider means of access to the parking area.
   I.   In the P-B (Planned Business) District, the entire parking area,
including parking spaces and maneuvering lanes, required under this section,
shall be provided with asphalt or concrete surfacing in accordance with
specifications approved by the Building Inspector. The parking area shall be
surfaced within one (1) year of the date the permit is issued.
   J.   Off-street parking areas shall be drained so as to dispose of all
surface water accumulated in the parking area in such a way as to preclude
drainage of water onto adjacent property unless drainage is directed into a
natural or public drainage course, or toward buildings.
   K.   All lighting for any off-street parking area shall be so installed as
to be confined within and directed only onto the parking area and the property
which it serves.
   L.   Parking structures shall be designed so that all architectural and
vehicular lighting is shielded or screened from the view from adjacent
properties. No lighting shall be so located or visible as to be a hazard to
traffic safety.
11-1004.   Standards for Driveways.
Clearly defined driveways shall be provided for entrance and exit to all off-
street parking and shall meet the following standards:
   A.   Number and Location of Driveways. To provide ease and convenience for
entrance and exit to public or private property and to provide maximum safety
with the least interference to traffic flow on public streets, the number, and
location of driveways shall be regulated relative to the amount of frontage
which the property has on a given street as follows:
 
Maximum # of Driveways
Lot Frontage             One Way Two Way
Less than 75 feet        2       1
75 feet - 149 feet       2*      1*
150 feet - 299 feet      4       2
Each additional 300 feet 4*      2*
 
*One (1) additional two-way driveway or two (2) additional one-way driveways
may be permitted based on existing and projected average daily traffic and for
the purpose of minimizing the amount of conflict between entering and exiting
traffic and through traffic on the abutting street.
   B.   Width of Driveway. The width of a driveway opening at the property line
shall be within the minimum and maximum limits specified as follows:
   1.   
 
Location        Minimum Maximum

All Other Uses:
One-Way         12 feet 24 feet
Two-Way         24 feet 50 feet (a) (b)
 
   a.   Provided, however, that on all city streets that are also designated as
state and/or federal highways, if the Tennessee Department of Transportation
shall approve a driveway width at variance with this section, such Tennessee
Department of Transportation approval shall supercede the provisions of this
section.
   b.   In M-1, M-2, or P-M districts where development conditions exist such
that proper ingress and egress to the property cannot be accommodated by a
driveway with a maximum width of 50 feet, the Planning Commission may authorize
a driveway opening at the property line in excess of 50 feet, with such
driveway opening at the property line not to exceed a maximum of 70 feet.
   2.   Automotive service stations, freight and trucking terminals, or other
commercial and industrial uses customarily having a large volume of tractor-
trailer vehicle traffic may have two (2) driveways forty (40) feet wide if a
minimum forty (40) foot distance is provided between the driveways.
   3.   Minimum width of travel lanes providing maneuvering space within a
parking lot for entrance to and exit from parking stalls shall be as follows:
   a.   90-degree parking   20 feet
   b.   60-degree parking   20 feet
   c.   45-degree parking   13 feet

opening - at the street right-of-way line:
   1.   Residential uses: One (1) foot.
   2.   Non-residential uses: Twelve and one-half (12 1/2) feet.
   3.   One driveway which provides common (joint) access to adjoining interior
lots may be permitted provided such driveway meets the purposes and intent of
this section.
   B.   Minimum distance from the intersection of street right-of-way lines on
a corner lot and a driveway opening at the right-of-way line: Twenty-five (25)
feet.
   C.   Minimum distance between two driveways serving the same property and
which provide access to the same street - measured at property line: twenty-
five (25) feet, or the width of the widest driveway, whichever is greater.
11-1006.   Radius of Curb Return.
The curb return radius shall met the following requirements provided, however,
that no such radius shall exceed the distance between the driveway opening at
the property line and the adjoining property line or one-half (1/2) the
distance to an adjacent driveway:
   A.   Residential uses: Five (5) feet minimum, fifteen (15) feet maximum.
   B.   Non-residential uses: Five (5) feet minimum, twenty (20) feet maximum.
11-1007.   Property Access Limited to Driveway.
In order to restrict entrance and exit to the approved driveway, all off-street
parking areas shall be constructed and properly curbed so that all movements to
park and unpark will take place within the property line.
11-1008.   Permit Required.
As provided in Section
12-110, of the Paris Municipal Code, no person shall cut or build a driveway
across a curb, sidewalk, or any public right-of-way, nor shall any existing
driveway be relocated, altered, or reconstructed without first obtaining a
permit approving the construction, reconstruction, relocation, or alteration of
such driveway.
Any such construction, reconstruction, relocation, or alteration of such
driveway shall conform to the standards of the Local Government Public Works
Standards and Specifications as adopted by the Board of Commissioners of the
City of Paris. Such construction, reconstruction, relocation, or alteration of
such driveway shall also meet all development standards required by the
Americans with Disabilities Act. (Ord.#1186, 4/11/16 / 5/5/16)

intended to provide a minimum guide to the surveyor, engineer of record, and
construction supervisors and should be used along with good engineering
practices as the type of project and situation warrants. These requirements
should complement, but do not supersede any other City construction/plan
requirements. The City of Paris requires construction record documentation
before project closeout and acceptance. Developers, engineers and contractors
need to be aware of these requirements in order to satisfy this documentation
requirement.
Good on-site records must be maintained to ensure accuracy. Upon completion of
the project, the Site Plans approved by the City of Paris are to be corrected
to accurately reflect all as-built conditions and shall be submitted by the
developer or the Tennessee Registered Professional Engineer that prepared them
to: City of Paris, 100 North Caldwell, Paris, TN 38242.
   2.   As Built Site Plan Format. The As Built Site Plan will be both in the
form of a 22 inch by 34 inch (22"x 34") printed copy and electronic clean set
of plans, upon which the Contractor shall note any additions and deletions of
work. The Contractor shall use red colored pencil to mark all work not shown on
the original Site Plans and green colored pencil for deleting any work from the
original Site Plans.
The Contractor shall also indicate all deviations in location and elevation of
improvements as shown on the Site Plans. As Built Site Plans will be reviewed
for accuracy and completeness by the reviewing engineer. If the as-built
information is found deficient, it shall be corrected by the Contractor and
resubmitted to the City for review and approval.
   D.    As Built Site Plans required for all Site Plans. As Built Site Plans
are required for all projects for which a Site Plan is approved pursuant to
this chapter even if there are no deviations from the original approved Site
Plan. (Ord. # 1274, 08 / 12 / 2021).

effective date of this ordinance and which do not conform to the provisions
herein.
11-1401.   Continuation of Non-Conforming Uses of Land and Structures.
Any existing non-conforming use of part or all of a structure, or any existing
non-conforming use of land not involving a structure or involving a structure
which is necessary to such use of land, may be continued, so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this Section.
   A.   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance
   1.   Normal maintenance, incidental alterations, and replacement of
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted
in whole or in part to a non-conforming use; provided, however, that any such
normal maintenance, incidental alterations, or replacement shall not be deemed
to authorize any violation of this Section.
   2.   As used herein, incidental alterations shall mean any changes or
replacements in the parts of a building or other structure, limited to the
following examples;
   a.   Alteration of interior partitions to improve livability in a non-
conforming residential building, provides that no additional dwelling units are
created;

enlarged except as provided herein. However, any industrial, commercial,
residential, or other business establishments made non-conforming by the
application of this ordinance which were either conforming to past regulations
or under no regulation shall be allowed to expand operations and construct
additional facilities with the following limitations. (Ord. # 920, 09/02/97).
   1.   There must be reasonable amount of space for such expansion on the
property where the industry or business is located.
   2.   All area requirements for the district where it is located must be met.
   3.   This shall only apply to land owned and in use by such affected
business and shall not operate to permit expansion of an existing industry or
business through the acquisition of additional land.
   C.   Relocation. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to non-
conforming use shall be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on
the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof
shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which
such structure and use are located after being so relocated. No non-conforming
use of land shall be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on the
same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all the
regulations of the zoning district in which such use of land is located after
being so relocated.
   D.   Change in Use. A non-conforming use of land or of a structure shall not
be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the zoning district in
which such land or structure is located. When such non-conforming use has been
changed to a permitted use, it shall only be used thereafter for a use
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located.
   E.   Abandonment or Discontinuance.
   1.   Except as otherwise provided herein, when a non-conforming use of part
or all of a structure is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 365
consecutive days such use shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed.
the resumption or re-establishment of any such non-conforming use shall only be
permitted when the structure has been occupied or the establishment has been in
operation for at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the 365 consecutive
days. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall comply
with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land or structure is
located.
   2.   When a non-conforming use of land or a non-conforming use of part or
all of a structure in a R-1 Low density residential District is discontinued or
abandoned for a period of 180 consecutive days, such non-conforming use or
structure shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed.
   F.   Damage or Destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted
in whole or in part to a non-conforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any
means, to the extent of 75% (seventy-five percent) or more of the fair market
value of such structure immediately prior to such damage, such structure shall
not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which such structure and
use are located. When such damage or destruction is less than 75% (seventy-five
percent) of the fair market value of the structure immediately prior to such
damage, such structures may be repaired and reconstructed and used for the same
purposes as it was before the damage or destruction, provided that such repair
or reconstruction is commenced and completed within twelve (12) months of the
date of such damage or destruction.
11-1402.   Non-Conforming Structures.
   A.   Continuation of a Non-Conforming Structure. Any non-conforming
structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district
in which such structure is located may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this Section.
   B.   Enlargement, Repair, Alteration, or Replacement.
   1.   Any non-conforming structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or
altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or
alteration shall create an additional non-conforming or increase the existing
non-conformity of all or any part of such structure.
   2.   A mobile home located on an individual lot prior to the adoption of
this ordinance may be replaced; provided, however, that no such replacement
shall either create an additional non-conformity or increase the existing non-
conformity of all or any part of such structure.
   C.   Damage or Destruction. In the event that any non-conforming structure
is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of seventy-five percent
(75% or more of the fair market value of such structure immediately prior to
such damage, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When
such non-conforming structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, by less
than seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value of such structure,
immediately prior to such damage, such structure may be repaired or
reconstructed, provided that such repairs or restorations begin and are
diligently pursued to completion within one (1) year of the date of such
damage.
   D.   Relocation. No non-conforming structure shall be located in whole or
part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire
structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in
which such structure is located.
11-1403.   Authority to Utilize Non-Conforming Lots of Record.
In any zoning district a lot of official record established prior to enactment
of, or any subsequent amendment to, this ordinance which fails to meet the
minimum requirements for area, width or both that are generally applicable to
the district in which the lot is located may be allowed to be utilized provided
that all the provisions of this section are met.
   A.   A non-conforming lot of record may be utilized provided the intent of
this ordinance is maintained and the health, safety and welfare of the
citizenry are protected.
   B.   The lot must represent a single lot of official record which is in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership at the effective date of adoption of amendment of his ordinance.
Contiguous non-conforming lots of record under single ownership shall be
combined for the purposes of this ordinance so that the requirements of the
district may be more readily met.
   C.   If such lot fails to meet the minimum requirements for area or width,
or both, that are generally applicable in the district, the required area and
width shall not apply to such lot; provided, however, that all yard, density or
other requirements of the district in which the lot is located shall be met to
the greatest reasonable degree.
   D.   Compliance with this section shall be ensured by, and the approval for
the utilization of the non-conforming lot of record shall be through action of
the Board of Zoning Appeals in the consideration of variance as set forth in
Section
11-1600 E. of this ordinance.
11-1404.   Exception for Repairs Pursuant to Public Order.
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoration to a safe condition of a building or structure in accordance with
an order of a Public Official who is charged with protecting the public safety
and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders it to restoration to a
safe condition, provided such restoration is not otherwise in violation of the
various provisions of this Section prohibiting the repair or restoration of
partially damaged or destroyed building, structures, or signs.
11-1405.   Non-Conforming Accessory Uses and Structures.
Non use or structure which is accessory to a principal non-conforming use or
structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have
ceased or terminated, unless such accessory use or structure shall thereafter
conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
11-1406.   Change of Tenancy or Ownership.
   A.   There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any
existing non-conforming use of land or structure, or non-conforming structures,
provided there is no change in the nature or character of such non-conformity
uses or non-conforming structures except as otherwise provided herein.
   B.   In areas designed as R-1, Low Density Residential District on the
Official Zoning Map of Paris, Tennessee, when a change of tenancy, ownership,
or management occurs in a non-conforming use of and or a non-conforming use of
part or all of a structure, such use shall not thereafter be re-established or
resumed.

a gross acre will be consumed by streets and parking bays and open space.
   C.   For multi-family development, the assigned lot area is modified by
building height, building coverage, number of stories, and spacing between
structures in relation to lot area.
11-1507.   Sidewalk Development.
   A.   Sidewalks are required when developing a lot on an existing street

11-1508.   Storm Water Management.
   A.   Purpose. This article is adopted to improve public safety, to control
the rate of flow of storm water, to minimize increases in the peak flow rates
of storm water runoff caused by development, to minimize any detrimental effect
on water quality by the completed facility, and to avoid such adverse effects
during construction.
   B.   Applicability: All new development (new construction, expansion,
modification, or alteration), which results in an increase in storm water
runoff of 10% or more, shall comply with this Storm Water Management Ordinance,
excluding any single residential lot or minor residential subdivision. All
major residential subdivisions, commercial and/or industrial developments shall
comply with this ordinance.
   C.   Critical Areas and No Increase Zones. The Planning Commission hereby
establishes four Critical Areas and four No Increase Zones, the boundaries of
which are depicted on the City of Paris, Storm Water Management, Critical Areas
and No Increase Zones map.
A critical area shall be defined as any area of the city that, after careful
review and research, the city manager, city planner, and city planning
commission agree shall be regarded as extremely sensitive to increases in storm
water runoff.
A no increase zone shall be defined as an area designated by the city planning
commission, within which no increase in storm water runoff shall be allowed,
except as expressly authorized in Section B of this ordinance.
   D.   Waivers. The Planning Commission shall reserve the right to waive the
detention requirements for any development which is physically located entirely
outside of the boundaries of a No Increase Zone, as shown on the City of Paris,
Storm Water Management, Critical Areas and No Increase Zones map, and meets the
conditions of one of the following:
   1.   Results in an increase in storm water flow of 10% or less, as
calculated by comparing the post-development runoff to the predevelopment
runoff, or
   2.   Results in an increase in storm water flow of 5 cfs or less, as
calculated by comparing the post-development runoff to the predevelopment
runoff.
   E.   Design Criteria. The following designs standards shall be adopted:
   1.   Storm drains and culverts shall be designed to pass the storm water
flow associated with a 25-year storm event.
   2.   Bridges shall be designed to pass the storm water flow associated with
a 100-year storm event.
   3.   Detention facilities and outfall structures shall be designed to
provide a minimum of 0.5 feet of freeboard above the maximum water surface
level and retain the increase(s) in storm water flow associated with the
following storm events:
   1.   1-year event
   2.   5-year event
   3.   10-year event
   4.   25-year event
   5.   Detention facility overflow structures shall be designed to pass the
storm water flow associated with a 50-year storm event.
   6.   The detention facility shall be analyzed based on the storm water flow
associated with a 100-year storm event and shall be designed such that the
facilities shall not encounter damage due to the 100-year flow.
   7.   Detention facilities may be provided by use of detention ponds,
underground detention piping, parking area depressions, or other methods that
meet the approval of the City Manager, City Planner and Regional Planning
Commission. Such facilities shall be clearly delineated on the grading plan.
   F.   Design Computations. The following computations, if applicable, shall
be submitted to the Planning Department as required for inclusion on the agenda
of the monthly Planning Commission meeting:
   1.   Pre- and Post-development runoff calculations.
   2.   Storm drain capacity.
   3.   Culvert analysis.
   4.   Bridge design.
   5.   Channel analysis.
   6.   Detention analysis.
For drainage areas less than 100 acres, storm water runoff shall be computed
using the Rational Equation method as follows: Q=ciA, where "i" is the rainfall
intensity for the applicable storm event. Rainfall intensity shall be
determined from the IDF curve for the City of Memphis, Tennessee. The IDF curve
can be found in either of the following documents:
   1.   Local Government Public Works Standards & Specifications, Drawing
Number RIDFC- 1; Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves.
   2.   Tennessee Department of Transportation, Design Division, Roadway Design
Guidelines, First Edition, October 1987, Chapter 2, Figure 2-10.
The rainfall intensity shall be computed based on the time of concentration for
the drainage area. Time of concentration shall be determined from an acceptable
nomograph or other method. In no case shall the time of concentration be less
than 5 minutes. An acceptable nomograph for computing time of concentration can
be found in:
Tennessee Department of Transportation, Design Division, Roadway Design
Guidelines, First Edition, October 1987, Chapter 2, Figure 2-11.
For drainage areas exceeding 100 acres, storm water runoff shall be computed
using the Regional Regression Equations for Hydrologic Area 4 of Tennessee. The
Regression equations can be found in:
Tennessee Department of Transportation, Design Division, Roadway Design
Guidelines, First Edition, October 1987, Chapter 2, Table 2-4.
If computer software is used to complete the design, the drainage submittal
shall include all inputs, outputs, warnings, and errors produced by the
software.

984, 09/06/01).
11-1604.   Variances.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. Pursuant to Section 13-7-207, Tennessee Code
Annotated, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide
applications for variances from the terms of this ordinance, but only where, by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of
property, which at the time of the adoption of this ordinance was a lot of
record; or where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other
extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a piece of property, the
strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would result in
practical difficulties to or undue hardship upon the owner of such property,
provided that such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the
public good and without substantially impairing the intents and purpose of this
ordinance.
   The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of the
specific requirements of this Ordinance in the case of exceptionally irregular,
narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions,
whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his
land. The variance shall be used only where necessary to overcome some obstacle
which is preventing an owner from using his property as the Zoning Ordinance
intended.
   B.   Application. After written denial of a building permit from the
Building Inspector, a property owner may make application for variance, using
forms obtainable.
   C.   Public Notice and Hearing. Public notice and hearing on the application
for a variance shall be as prescribed in Section
11-601 above.
   D.   Standard for Variance. In granting a variance, the Board shall insure
that all of the following criteria are met.
   1.   Variances shall be granted only where special circumstances or
conditions (such as exceptional narrowness, topography, or sitting) fully
described in the findings of the Board, do not apply generally in the district.
   2.   Variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded from
the district in which requested.
   3.   Variances shall not be granted that will confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is prohibited by this Ordinance to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
   4.   For reasons fully set forth in the findings of the Board, the aforesaid
circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the
provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use
of his land. Loss in property value shall not justify a variance; there must be
a deprivation of beneficial use of land.
   5.   Any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall be the
minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.
   6.   The granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purposes
and intent of this Ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood,
detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the comprehensive plan
for development.
   E.   Prohibition of Use Variances. Under no circumstances shall the Board of
Appeals grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this Ordinance in said district.
11-1605.   Conditions and Restrictions by the Board.
The Board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises
benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set
forth above to reduce or minimize the effect of such variance upon surrounding
property and carry out the general intent of this Ordinance. The Board may
establish expiration dates as a condition or as a part of the variances.

wherever possible so that the excavations necessary for it are not in the paved
portion of the right-of-way.
3.12.1   If Company does a bore (directional or otherwise) underneath a street
or Public Way, involving distribution cable or fiber, then Company shall make
its best efforts to notify City in advance of such bore. If City so desires,

any provisions of this Franchise which City reasonably determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of the money (including, without limitation, the
assessment of liquidated damages), then City may demand and receive payment
under such bond.

(Ord. #1307, 09/05/24)
13-502.   Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply: words
used in the singular shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the
singular; words used in the present tense shall include the future tense. The
word “shall” is mandatory and not discretionary. The word “may” is permissive.
Words not defined in this section shall be construed to have the meaning given
by common and ordinary use as defined in the latest edition of Webster’s
Dictionary.
   1.   Administrative or Civil Penalties - Under the authority provided in
Tennessee Code Annotated § 68-221-1106, the City of Paris declares that any
person violating the provisions of this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty
by the City of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day for each day of violations. Each day of
violation shall constitute a separate violation.
   2.   Analytical Monitoring - Test procedures for the analysis of pollutants
shall conform to regulations published pursuant to Section 304 (h) of the Clean
Water Act (the "Act"), as amended, under which such procedures may be required.
Pollutant parameters shall be determined using sufficiently sensitive methods
in Title 40 C.F.R. § 136, as amended, and promulgated pursuant to Section 304
(h) of the Act. The chosen methods must be sufficiently sensitive as required
in Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Rule 0400-40-03-.05(8).
   3.   Aquatic Resource Alteration Permit (ARAP) - ARAP means a permit issued
pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated § 69-3-108, which authorizes the
alteration of properties of waters of the state that result from activities
other than discharges of wastewater through a pipe, ditch, or other conveyance.
   4.   “As Built Plans” or “Record Drawings” mean drawings depicting
conditions as they were actually constructed.
   5.   Best Management Practices (“BMPs”) means schedules of activities,
prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures and other management
practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to waters of the
state. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures; and
practices to control plant site runoff, spillage, leaks, sludge or waste
disposal, or drainage from raw material storage. BMPs include source control
practices (non-structural BMPs) and engineered structures designed to treat
runoff.    
      ∙    Structural BMPs are facilities that help prevent pollutants in
stormwater runoff from leaving the site.
      ∙    Non-structural BMPs are techniques, activities and processes that
reduce pollutants at the source.
   6.   BMP Manual provides technical guidance including additional policies,
criteria, standards, specifications, constants, and information for the proper
implementation of the requirements of the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System permit (NPDES) and 40 CFR § 122 as applicable for stormwater
discharges.
   7.   Borrow Pit is an excavation from which erodible material (typically
soil) is removed to be fill for another site. There is no processing or
separation of erodible material conducted at the site. Given the nature of
activity and pollutants present at such excavation, a borrow pit is considered
a construction activity.
   8.   Buffer Zone or Water Quality Riparian Buffer is a permanent strip of
natural perennial vegetation, adjacent to a stream, river, wetland, pond, or
lake that contains dense vegetation made up of grass, shrubs, and/or trees. The
purpose of a water quality riparian buffer is to maintain existing water
quality by minimizing risk of any potential sediments, nutrients or other
pollutants reaching adjacent surface waters and to further prevent negative
water quality impacts by providing canopy over adjacent waters.
   9.   Channel means a natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed
and banks that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water.
   10.   Clearing refers to removal of vegetation and disturbance of soil prior
to grading or excavation in anticipation of construction activities. Clearing
may also refer to wide area land disturbance in anticipation of non-
construction activities. Clearing, grading, and excavation do not refer to
clearing of vegetation along existing or new roadways, highways, dams, or power
lines for sight distance or other maintenance and/or safety concerns, or cold
planning, milling, and/or removal of concrete and/or bituminous asphalt roadway
pavement surfaces. The clearing of land for agricultural purposes is exempt
from federal stormwater NPDES permitting in accordance with Section 401(1)(1)
of the 1987 Water Quality Act and state stormwater NPDES permitting in
accordance with the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act of 1977, Tennessee Code
Annotateed 69-3-101, et seq.
   11.   Commencement of construction: the initial disturbance of soils
associated with clearing, grading, excavating or other construction activities.
   12.   Common plan of development or sale is broadly defined as any
announcement or documentation (including a sign, public notice or hearing,
sales pitch, advertisement, drawing, permit application, zoning request,
computer design, etc.) or physical demarcation (including boundary signs, lot
stakes, surveyor markings, etc.) indicating construction activities may occur
on a specific plot. A common plan of development or sale identifies a situation
in which multiple areas of disturbance are occurring on contiguous areas. This
applies because the activities may take place at different times, on different
schedules, by different operators.
   13.   Control measure refers to any Best Management Practice (BMP) or other
method used to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to waters of the
state.
   14.   CWA means the Clean Water Act of 1977, as amended, or the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1251, et seq.)
   15.   Design storm is a storm event as defined by Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States. Atlas 14. Volume 2. Version 3.0. U.S. Department of
Commerce. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National
Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Springs,
Maryland or its digital product equivalent. The estimated design rainfall
amounts, for any return period interval (i.e., 1,-yr, 2-yr, 5-yr, 25-yr, etc.,)
in terms of either depths or intensities for any duration, can be found by
accessing the data available at https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/
pfds_map_cont.html.
   16.   Discharge or discharge of a pollutant refers to the addition of
pollutants to waters from a source.
   17.   An ecoregion is a relatively homogeneous area defined by similarity of
climate, landform, soil, potential natural vegetation, hydrology, or other
ecologically relevant variables. Ecoregions can be determined for specific
stream segments by using Tennessee’s Online Water Quality Assessment Data
viewer http://tdeconline.tn.gov/dwr.
   18.   Exceptional Tennessee Waters are surface waters designated by the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation as having the
characteristics set forth at Tennessee Rules, Chapter 0400-40-03-.06(4).
Characteristics include waters within parks or refuges; scenic rivers; waters
with threatened or endangered species; waters that provide specialized
recreational opportunities; waters within areas designated as lands unsuitable
for mining; waters with naturally reproducing trout; waters with exceptional
biological diversity and other waters with outstanding ecological or
recreational value.
   19.   Hot spot means an area where land use or activities generate highly
contaminated runoff, with concentrations of pollutants in excess of those
typically found in stormwater. Examples might include operations producing
concrete or asphalt, auto repair shops, auto supply shops, large commercial
parking areas and restaurants.
   20.   Improved sinkhole is a natural surface depression that has been
altered in order to direct fluids into the hole opening. Improved sinkhole is a
type of injection well regulated under the Underground Injection Control (UIC)
program of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.
Underground injection constitutes an intentional disposal of waste waters in
natural depressions, open fractures and crevices, such as those commonly
associated with weathering of limestone.
   21.   Level 1 - Fundamentals of Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control
training and certification program administered by University of Tennessee
Water Resources Research Center (https://tnepsc.org/index.asp).
   22.   Level 2 - Design Principles for Erosion Prevention and Sediment
Control for Construction Sites training and certification program administered
by University of Tennessee Water Resources Research Center (https://tnepsc.org/
index.asp).
   23.   Linear Project is a land disturbing activity as conducted by an
underground/overhead utility or highway department, including, but not limited
to, any cable line or wire for the transmission of electrical energy; any
conveyance pipeline for transportation of gaseous or liquid substance; any
cable line or wire for communications; or any other energy resource
transmission ROW or utility infrastructure, e.g., roads and highways.
Activities include the construction and installation of these utilities within
a corridor. Linear project activities also include the construction of access
roads, staging areas and borrow/spoil sites associated with the linear project.
Land disturbance specific to the development of residential and commercial
subdivisions or high-rise structures is not considered a linear project.
   24.   Monitoring refers to tracking or measuring activities, progress,
results, etc., and can refer to non-analytical monitoring for pollutants by
means other than 40 CFR § 136 (and other than state- or federally established
protocols in the case of biological monitoring and assessments), such as
visually or by qualitative tools that provide comparative values or rough

   25.   Municipality means any incorporated city or town, county, metropolitan
or consolidated government, or special district of this state empowered to
provide storm water facilities.
   26.   Operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or
supervises a source. Including, but not limited to, an owner or operator of any
“facility or activity” subject to regulation under the NPDES program.
   27.   Permanent Stabilization means that all soil disturbing activities at
the site have been completed and one of the three following criteria is met:
      ∙    A perennial, preferably native, vegetative cover with a uniform
(i.e., evenly distributed, without large bare areas) density of at least 70
percent has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by
permanent structures, and all slopes and channels have been permanently
stabilized against erosion.
      ∙    Equivalent permanent stabilization measures such as the use of
riprap; permanent geotextiles; hardened surface materials including concrete,
asphalt, gabion baskets or Reno mattresses have been employed.
      ∙    For construction projects on land used for agricultural or
silvicultural purposes, permanent stabilization may be accomplished by
returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural or
silvicultural use.

discrete conveyance, including but not limited to, any pipe, ditch, channel,
tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated
animal feeding operation, landfill leachate collection system, vessel or other
floating craft from which pollutants are or may be discharged. This term does
not include introduction of pollutants from non-point source agricultural and
silvicultural activities, including stormwater runoff from orchards, cultivated
crops, pastures, range lands, forest lands or return flows from irrigated
agriculture or agricultural stormwater runoff. In short, outfall is a point
where runoff leaves the site as a concentrated flow in a discrete conveyance.
   29.   Pollutant means sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes.
   30.   Priority construction means those construction activities discharging
directly into, or immediately upstream of, waters the state recognized as
unavailable condition for siltation or Exceptional Tennessee Waters.
   31.   A rainfall event is defined as any occurrence of rain preceded by 10
hours without precipitation that results in an accumulation of 0.01 inches or
more. Instances of rainfall occurring within 10 hours of each other will be
considered a single rainfall event.
   32.   Registered Engineer and Registered Landscape Architect An engineer or
landscape architect certified and registered by the State Board of
Architectural and Engineer Examiners pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated § 62-
2-101, et seq.
   33.   Runoff coefficient means the fraction of total rainfall that will
appear at the conveyance as runoff. Runoff coefficient is also defined as the
ratio of the amount of water that is not absorbed by the surface to the total
amount of water that falls during a rainstorm.
   34.   Sediment means solid material, both inorganic (mineral) and organic,
that is in suspension, is being transported; or has been moved from the site of
origin by wind, water, gravity or ice as a product of erosion.
   35.   Sediment basin A temporary basin consisting of an embankment
constructed across a wet weather conveyance, an excavation that creates a basin
or by a combination of both. A sediment basin typically consists of a forebay
cell, , impoundment, permanent pool, primary spillway, secondary or emergency
spillway and surface dewatering device. The size and shape of the basin depends
on the location, size of drainage area, incoming runoff volume and peak flow,
soil type and particle size, land cover, and receiving stream classification

“stream” means a surface water that is not a wet weather conveyance.
   43.   Stormwater associated with industrial activity is defined in 40 CFR. §
122.26(b)(14) and incorporated here by reference. Most relevant to the City is
40 CFR § 122.26(b)(14)(x), which relates to construction activity including
clearing, grading, filling and excavation activities, including borrow pits
containing erodible material. Disturbance of soil for the purpose of crop
production is exempt from NPDES permit requirements, but stormwater discharges
from agriculture-related activities that involve construction of structures
(e.g., barn construction, road construction, pond construction) are considered
associated with industrial (construction) activity. Maintenance to the original
line and grade, hydraulic capacity; or to the original purpose of the facility
(e.g., re-clearing, minor excavation performed around an existing structure
necessary for maintenance or repair and repaving of an existing road) is not
considered a construction activity.
   44.   Construction stormwater discharge-related activities means activities
that cause, contribute to or result in point source stormwater pollutant
discharges. These activities may include excavation, site development, grading
and other surface disturbance activities; and activities to control stormwater
including the siting, construction and operation of best management practices
(BMPs).
   45.   Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is a written site-
specific plan required by the Tennessee Construction General Permit (CGP) that
includes a narrative pollution prevention plan and graphical erosion and
sediment control plan. In its basic form, the plan contains a site map, a
description of construction activities that could introduce pollutants to
stormwater runoff, a description of measures or practices to control these
pollutants, and erosion and sediment control plans and specifications. The
SWPPP should be prepared in accordance with the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment
Control Handbook (latest edition).
   46.   Take of an endangered species means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt,
shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect, or attempt to engage in any such
conduct.
   47.   Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control (TDESC) Handbook is a guidance
issued by the Division of Water Resources for the purpose of developing
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans and Erosion and Sediment Control Plans
required by the Construction General Permit CGP.
   48.   Temporary stabilization is achieved when vegetation or non-erodible
surface has been established on the area of disturbance and construction
activity has temporarily ceased. Under certain conditions, temporary
stabilization is required when construction activities temporarily cease.
   49.   Treatment chemicals are polymers, flocculants or other chemicals used
to reduce turbidity in stormwater discharges by chemically bonding to suspended
silts and other soil materials and causing them to bind together and settle
out. Common examples of anionic treatment chemicals are polyacrylamide-chitosan
(PAM–CS) .
   50.   Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by
individual particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the
naked eye, similar to smoke in air.
   51.   Waste site is an area where material from a construction site is
disposed of. When the material is erodible, such as soil, the site must be
treated as a construction site.
   52.   Waters (or waters of the state) means any and all water, public or
private, on or beneath the surface of the ground, which are contained within,
flow through, or border upon Tennessee or any portion thereof, except those
bodies of water confined to and retained within the limits of private property
in single ownership which do not combine or effect a junction with natural
surface or underground waters.
   53.   Waters with unavailable parameters means any segment of surface waters
that has been identified by the TDEC as failing to support one or more
classified uses. Unavailable parameters exist where water quality is at, or
fails to meet, the levels specified in water quality criteria in Rule 0400-40-
03-.03, even if caused by natural conditions. In the case of a criterion that
is a single response variable or is derived from measurement of multiple
response variables, the unavailable parameters shall be the agents causing
water quality to be at or failing to meet the levels specified in criteria.
Resources to be used in making this determination include biennial compilations
of impaired waters, databases of assessment information, updated GIS coverages
(https://tdeconline.tn.gov/dwr/), and the results of recent field surveys. GIS
coverages of the streams and lakes not meeting water quality standards, plus
the biennial list of waters with unavailable parameters, can be found at https:
//www.tn.gov/environment/program-areas/wr-water-resources/water-quality/water-
quality-reports---publications.html.
   54.   Water quality riparian buffer means a permanent strip of natural
perennial vegetation adjacent to a stream, river, wetland, pond, or lake that
contains dense vegetation made up of grass, shrubs, and/or trees. The purpose
of a water quality riparian buffer is to maintain existing water quality by
minimizing the risk of any potential sediments, nutrients, or other pollutants
reaching adjacent surface waters and to further prevent negative water quality
impacts by providing canopy over adjacent waters.
   55.   A one-week period is a synonym of a calendar-week; typically, a period
from Sunday through Saturday.
   56.   Water quality treatment volume (WQTV) is a portion of the runoff
generated from impervious surfaces at a new development or redevelopment
project by the 1-year 24-hour design storm. The WQTV is further determined by
the type of treatment provided.
   57.   Wet weather conveyances are man-made or natural watercourses,
including natural watercourses that have been modified by channelization, that
meet the following:
      ∙    The conveyance carries flow only in direct response to precipitation
runoff in its immediate locality.
      ∙    The conveyance channels are at all times above the groundwater
table.
      ∙    The flow carried by the conveyance is not suitable for drinking
water supplies.
      ∙    Hydrological and biological analyses indicate that, due to naturally
occurring ephemeral or low flow under normal weather conditions, there is not
sufficient water to support fish or multiple populations of obligate lotic
aquatic organisms whose life cycle includes an aquatic phase of at least two
months. See Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Rule 0400-40-
3-.04(3).

or written wavier from such permits and licenses prior to the issuance of a
land disturbance permit by the City of Paris.
         ix.   If unpermitted construction activity is on-going, the City of
Paris will issue and immediate stop-work order. If, in addition to the City of
Paris’s permit, a TDEC permit was required but was not obtained, the violator

   10.   Twice-Weekly inspections of the site and the BMP’s/SCM’s must be
performed by an individual who has either received certification under the
Level I Fundamentals of Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control course or has
other credentials identified as equivalent within this ordinance.
   11.   Landscaping and stabilization requirements.
      a.   Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been
either partially or wholly cleared by development activities shall be
stabilized. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as possible in
portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or
permanently ceased. Temporary or permanent soil stabilization at the
construction site (or a phase of the project) must be completed not later than
14 days after the construction activity in that portion of the site has
temporarily or permanently ceased. In the following situations, temporary
stabilization measures are not required:
         i.   where the initiation of stabilization measures is precluded by
snow cover or frozen ground conditions or adverse soggy ground conditions,
stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable; or
         ii.   where construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing activities will be resumed within 14
days.
      b.   For steep slopes of 35% or more stabilization measures shall be
initiated within 7 days Construction buffer zones. Construction buffer zones
shall be those water quality buffers and buffer zones as defined in 13-502
above and shall meet the requirements in this ordinance and, where appropriate
in the TN CGP. The criteria for the width of the construction buffer zone can
be established on an average width basis at a project, as long as the minimum
width of the buffer zone is more than the required minimum width at any
measured location. If the new development or redevelopment site encompasses
both sides of a stream, buffer averaging can be applied to both sides, but must
be applied independently. Water quality riparian buffer widths are measured
from the top of bank also referred to as the “ordinary high-water mark.”
Construction buffers are not primary sediment control measures and shall not be
relied on as such. Stormwater discharges must enter the water quality riparian
buffer zone as sheet flow, not as concentrated flow, where site conditions
allow. The designer/operator must comply with the vegetation requirements and
the permissible land uses set forth for buffers in the TN CGP. Where it is not
practicable to maintain a construction water quality riparian buffer, BMPs
providing equivalent protection to a receiving stream as a natural water
quality riparian buffer must be used.
      c.   In arid, semiarid, and drought-stricken areas where initiating
vegetative stabilization measures immediately is infeasible, alternative
stabilization measures such as properly anchored mulch, soil binders or matting
must be employed.
   12.   Notice of Termination (NOT) the operator shall provide the City of
Paris with a copy of the NOT when it is issued by TDEC.
   13.   As built plans (record drawings). All applicants are required to
submit actual as built plans certified by the design engineer for any
structures located on-site after final construction is completed. The plan must
show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities
and must be sealed by a registered professional engineer licensed to practice
in Tennessee. A certification by the design engineer certifying that SCM’s will
function within original design parameters as constructed shall be included. A
final inspection by the City of Paris is required before any performance
security or performance bond will be released. The City of Paris shall have the
discretion to adopt provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the
performance security or performance bond on the completion of various stages of
development. In addition, occupation permits shall not be granted until
corrections to all BMP’s/SCM’s have been made and accepted by the City of
Paris. No bonds or securities shall be released by the City of Paris until the
(Stormwater Manager) has accepted the as built plans. The warranty period for
any infrastructure to be accepted by the City of Paris for maintenance shall
not commence until the City of Paris has accepted the as built plans.
   14.   Equipment manufacturer startups. No bonds or securities shall be
released until any equipment to be maintained by the City of Paris passes any
specified manufacturer startup procedure. The warranty period shall not
commence prior to the equipment passing any specified manufacturer startup
procedure.
(Ord. #1307, 09/05/24)
13-504.   Permanent stormwater management: design and construction inspection.
   1.   In order to comply with the City of Paris’s permanent stormwater
standards for new development and redevelopment projects, design and install
SCMs as established by Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
Rule 0400-40-10-.04 and comply with other requirements of Rule 0400-40-10-.04.
For design purposes, total suspended solids (TSS) may be used as the indicator
for the reduction of pollutants.
   2.   SCMs must be designed to provide full treatment capacity within 72
hours following the end of the preceding rain event for the life of the new
development or redevelopment project. The designer may select from the most
appropriate alternatives listed in the City of Paris’s BMP Manual.
   3.   Designs shall be based on the 24-hour design storm adopted by the City
of Paris. The City of Paris has adopted, for use in designing water quality
SCMs, the design storm requirements as established in Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation Rule 0400-40-10-.04. The Post Construction/
Permanent water quality design storm is a 1-year, 24-hour storm event for water
quality SCMs. See definition of Design Storm Event for the municipality’s
rainfall amounts for each return period interval. See NOAA Atlas 14 for
precipitation amounts: https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/pfds/
pfds_map_cont.html?bkmrk=tn.
   4.   Water Quality Riparian Buffers . Post Construction/Permanent water
quality riparian buffers shall be those buffers defined in 13-502 above and
shall meet the requirements described in this ordinance. The criteria for the
width of the post construction/permanent buffer zone can be established on an
average width basis at a project, as long as the minimum width of the buffer
zone is more than the required minimum width at any measured location. If the
new development or redevelopment site encompasses both sides of a stream,
buffer averaging can be applied to both sides, but must be applied
independently. Water quality riparian buffer widths are measured from the top
of bank also referred to as the “ordinary high-water mark.” Stormwater
discharges should enter the post construction/permanent water quality riparian
buffer as sheet flow, not as concentrated flow, where site conditions allow.
   Post Construction/Permanent buffers for waters with available parameters for
siltation or habitat alteration or unassessed waters:
   a.   Average buffer width: 30 feet.
   b.   Minimum buffer width: 15 feet
   Post Construction/Permanent buffers for Exceptional Tennessee Waters or
waters with unavailable parameters for siltation or habitat alteration:
   a.   Average buffer width: 60 feet.
   b.   Minimum buffer width: 30 feet
   The designer/operator must comply with the vegetation requirements and the
permissible land uses set forth for buffers in the MS4 permit.
(Ord. #1307, 09/05/24)
13-505.   Permanent SCM maintenance and inspection.
   1.   As Built Plans. All applicants are required to submit actual as built
plans for any structures located on-site within 90 days after final
construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications
for all stormwater management facilities and must be sealed by either a
registered professional engineer or landscape architect licensed to practice in
Tennessee. A sealed certification by the design engineer that all SCM’s will
function within design parameters as constructed shall accompany the as built
plans. A final inspection by the City of Paris is required before any
performance security or performance bond will be released. The City of Paris
shall have the discretion to adopt provisions for a partial pro-rata release of
the performance security or performance bond on the completion of various
stages of development. In addition, occupation permits shall not be granted
until corrections to all stormwater management facilities have been made and
accepted by the City of Paris.
   2.   In addition to the certified as built drawings, the City of Paris shall
be provided with a permanent stormwater management plan for the site and all
stormwater management facilities (e.g., SCM’s). Occupation permits shall not be
granted until the permanent stormwater management plan has been approved and
accepted by the City of Paris.
   3.   Inspection of stormwater management facilities. Periodic inspections of
facilities shall be performed, documented, and reported in accordance with this
chapter, as detailed in §
13-506.
   4.   Records of installation and maintenance activities.  Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management
facility shall make records of the installation of the stormwater facility, and
of all maintenance and repairs to the facility, and shall retain the records
for at least three (3) years. These records shall be made available to the City
of Paris during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon
request.
   5.   Failure to meet or maintain design or maintenance standards. If a
responsible party fails or refuses to meet the design or maintenance standards
required for stormwater facilities under this chapter, the City of Paris, after
notice as specified in the Enforcement Response Plan, may correct a violation
of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work
to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the
stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public
health, the City of Paris shall notify in writing the party responsible for
maintenance of the stormwater management facility. Upon receipt of that notice,
the responsible person shall have thirty (30) days to effect maintenance and
repair of the facility in an approved manner. In the event that corrective
action is not undertaken within that time, the City of Paris may take necessary
corrective action. The cost of any action by the City of Paris under this
section shall be charged to the responsible party.
   6.   In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger
to public health/public safety, the City of Paris may take such immediate
corrective action as deemed necessary.
(Ord. #1307, 09/05/24)

accordance with the requirements of subsection (5) below for the purpose of
documenting maintenance and repair needs and to ensure compliance with the
requirements of this ordinance. The property owners will arrange for this
inspection to be conducted by individual(s) approved by the City of Paris who
will submit a signed written report of the inspection to the City of Paris. It
shall also grant permission to the City of Paris to enter the property at
reasonable times and to inspect the stormwater facility to ensure that it is
being properly maintained.
      c.   Provide that the minimum maintenance and repair needs include but
are not limited to: the removal of silt, litter and other debris, the cutting
of grass, cutting and vegetation removal, and the replacement of landscape
vegetation, in detention and retention basins, and inlets and drainage pipes
and any other stormwater facilities. It shall also provide that the property
owners shall be responsible for additional maintenance and repair needed to
meet the intended design specification of the stormwater facility.
      d.   Provide that maintenance needs must be addressed in a timely manner,
on a schedule to be determined by the City of Paris.

affecting or caused by such locations and developments, and the specific
actions required to correct those problems. The notice shall also specify a
reasonable time for compliance. Discharges from existing SCM’s that have not
been maintained and/or inspected in accordance with this ordinance shall be
regarded as non-compliant discharges.
      b.   Inspection of existing facilities. The City of Paris may, to the
extent authorized by state and federal law, enter and inspect private property
for the purpose of determining if there are illicit non-stormwater discharges,
and to establish inspection programs to verify that all stormwater management
facilities are functioning within design limits. These inspection programs may
be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine
inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or
pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with
higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations
of the City of Paris’s NPDES MS4 stormwater permit; and joint inspections with
other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may
include but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records;
sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in
drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control
facilities and other SCM’s.
   3.   Owner/Operator Inspections. The owners and/or operators of the SCMs
shall:

limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the
connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection. This prohibition expressly includes SCM’s connected to
the system not properly inspected and maintained in accordance with this
ordinance.
      a.   Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the
person’s expense, the BMP’s necessary to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of

suspected release of materials which are resulting in, or may result in,
illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into, the municipal separate storm
sewer system, the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials the person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the City
of Paris in person or by telephone, fax, or email, no later than the next

of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years.

outside an authorized landfill, convenience center or other authorized garbage
or trash collection point, any trash or garbage of any kind or description on
any private or public property, occupied or unoccupied, inside the City of
Paris. Such illegal activity exposes runoff to contamination, generating an
illicit discharge. Therefore, any individual or corporation guilty of illegal
dumping may have committed a violation of this ordinance.

stormwater system, which provides for the collection, treatment, storage and
disposal of stormwater, provides benefits and services to all property within
the incorporated City limits. Such benefits include, but are not limited to:
the provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance, detention,
retention, treatment and release of stormwater, the reductions of hazards to
property and life resulting from stormwater runoff, improvements in general
health and welfare through reduction of undesirable stormwater conditions, and
improvements to water quality in the stormwater and surface water system and
its receiving waters of the state all of which are managed by the Stormwater
Project Manager as part of the Municipal Storm Sewer System (MS4) Program.
   (2)   Purpose. The objective of this ordinance is to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of the City and its citizens in compliance
with the Federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., and Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 68-221-1101 et seq. which require municipalities to implement
stormwater management programs, within prescribed time frames, to regulate
stormwater discharges to protect water quality; establish adequate systems of
collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of stormwater; reduce
hazards of property and life resulting from stormwater runoff; and enable
municipalities to fix and require payment of fees for the privilege of
discharging stormwater. The City finds that a stormwater management system
which provides for the treatment of stormwater is of benefit and provides
services to all property within the City.
It is further determined and declared that charges shall be established for
each parcel of real property located within the municipal limits of the City as
provided hereinafter to provide for dedicated funding sources for the
administration of stormwater management programs and/or the stormwater system
of the City. The proceeds of charges so derived shall be used for the purposes
of stormwater management including, but not limited to: planning, operation,
maintenance, repair, replacement and debt service of the City's stormwater
management programs and systems necessary to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the public.
The purpose of the Stormwater user fee is to provide stormwater management for

   (a)   Administer and enforce the City Stormwater Management Ordinance, the
same being 11.1305 et seq. of the Paris Municipal Code;
   (b)   Administer, plan, and implement stormwater projects to protect,
maintain and enhance the environment of the City;
   (c)   Implement activities necessary to maintain compliance with the City's
MS4 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit and
applicable regulations, 40 CFR Section 122.26 for stormwater discharges;
   (d)   Annually analyze the cost of services provided and the system and
structure of fees, charges, civil penalties and other revenues of the fee and
make recommendations for changes therein as necessary to support the Stormwater
Fee services; and,
   (e)   Advise the Board of Commissioners, City Manager, and other City
departments on matters relating to the fee.

as a regular interval charge, which shall be set from time to time by ordinance
as adopted by the City. Prior to establishing or amending the stormwater user
fee, the City shall advertise its intent to do so by publishing notice in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City a least ten (10) days in advance
of the meeting of the Board of Commissioners which shall consider the adoption
of the fee or its amendment.
13-708.   Property classification for stormwater user fees.
   (1)   Property classifications. For purposes of determining the stormwater
user fee, all properties in the City are classified into one of the following
categories:
   (a)   Residential property for single or multifamily;
   The Board of Commissioners finds that the intensity of development of most
parcels of real property in the City classified as single or multifamily
residential is less than the average intensity of development for other
developed property and similar to each other and that it would be excessively
and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the
impervious surface on each parcel. Therefore, all residential properties in the
City shall be charged the unit rate for residential properties regardless of
the size of the parcel or the impervious surface area of the improvements.
   (b)   Other developed property;
   The fee for other developed property (i.e., nonresidential property) in the
City shall be the unit rate for other developed property.
   (c)   Vacant/undeveloped property;
   There shall be no stormwater user fee for vacant/undeveloped property or as
otherwise provided by State Law.
   (d)   Exempt property; and
   There shall be no stormwater user fee for exempt property or as otherwise
provided by State Law.
   (e)   Unit rate
   Unit rate for residential properties and other developed properties shall be
defined by resolution by the Board of Commissioners.
   (2)   The unit rate for residential property shall be two dollars and fifty
cents ($2.50) per month. The unit rate for other developed property shall be
based on the total acreage of the property, as listed below:
13-709.   Property owners to pay charges.
The owner of each parcel of developed property shall be obligated to pay the
stormwater user fee as provided in this ordinance, provided however, that if no
electric service is being provided by the Paris Board of Public Utilities at
the property to the owner as a customer of record and such service is being
provided to a customer of record other than the owner, it shall be presumed
that the owner and such customer of record have agreed that the customer of
record shall be obligated to pay such stormwater user fee.
Residential properties shall be billed a flat residential fee based on the
placement of utility meters. In the case of a multifamily residential property,
if units are not individually billed for any electric service, i.e. a unit's
electric service is billed to a master meter, then the parcel owner for the
master meter shall be billed as other developed property based on the acreage
of the property.
13-710.   Billing procedures.
   (1)   Rate and collection schedule. The stormwater user fee shall be billed
and collected monthly as a part of the monthly utility bill issued by Paris
Board of Public Utilities for all residential or other developed properties
within the corporate limits.
The City and Paris Board of Public Utilities shall enter into a contract
pursuant to T.C.A. 68-221-1101 et seq. whereby Paris Board of Public Utilities
collects the stormwater user fee. Such contract shall include the provisions of
T.C.A. 11-221-1107 regarding discontinuance of utility service upon non-payment
of the stormwater user fee portion of the Paris Board of Public Utilities bill.
   (2)   Mandatory statement. Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated § 68-221-
1112, each bill that shall contain stormwater user fees shall contain the
following statement in bold: "THIS FEE HAS BEEN MANDATED BY CONGRESS".
13-711.   Appeals of fees.
Any party who disagrees with the calculation of the stormwater user fee, as
provided in this ordinance, may appeal such fee determination to the Housing
Board of Adjustments and Appeals within sixty (60) days after receipt of any
stormwater bill. Any appeal not filed within the time permitted by this section
shall be deemed waived. An appeal does not relieve any fees until decided
during the appeal.
All appeals shall be filed in writing addressed to the Stormwater Project
Manager for the City and shall state the grounds for the appeal and the amount
of the stormwater user fee the appellant asserts is appropriate. The appealing
party shall provide such information and documentation supporting the basis of
the appeal.
The Housing Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall review the appeal and
determine whether the challenged determination is consistent with the
provisions of this chapter. Appeals related to the stormwater user fee shall be
decided based on substantiated evidence with a sound engineering and factual
basis. All appeal determinations shall be applied utilizing a strict
interpretation of the Stormwater Fee Ordinance. At any hearing related to an
appeal or credit determination, the City shall be allowed to present evidence,
findings, and recommendations; appealing parties and applicants shall be given
an opportunity to present evidence, findings, and recommendations.
Each appeal shall be placed on the Housing Board of Adjustments and Appeals
agenda within (30) days after the Stormwater Project Manager receives the
written appeal. The Housing Board of Adjustments and Appeals may request
additional information from the appealing party; the Housing Board of
Adjustments and Appeals may defer the determination of an appeal one time to a
later meeting, which meeting shall occur within (30) days of the initial
meeting.
The Stormwater Project Manager shall notify the appealing party of the date of
the appeal review hearing in writing. Such written notice shall be given at
least ten (10) days prior to the hearing by regular mail at the address
provided in the written appeal document. The decision of the Housing Board of
Adjustments and Appeals shall be final and conclusive with no further
administrative review.

days hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this ordinance, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the
complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has
occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from

appropriate.
   (e)   If any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of

however, that the City Manager first complies with the provisions of the Fourth
Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The City Manager may
issue subpoenas to compel his access to or the production of such materials, or
the appearance of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent,
to the same extend and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the
subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in
the United States District court of the district in which the investigation is
taking place. The City Manager may administer oaths.
   (b)   Upon written application to the City Manager, a respondent shall be
entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name
of the city manager to the same extend and subject to the same limitations as
subpoenas issued by the city manager himself. Subpoenas issued at the request
of a respondent shall show on their face the name and address of such
respondent and shall state that they were issued at this request.
   (c)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the City Manager shall be entitled
to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United
States District courts. Fees payable to the witness summoned by a subpoena
issued at the request of a responded shall be paid by him.
   (d)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the City Manager to revoke or modify the subpoena. The City
Manager shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires
appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires
production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation,
that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be
produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
   (e)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the City Manager
or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
ARTICLE I   PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS, AUTHORITY, AND JURISDICTION
   A.   PURPOSE   Land subdivision is the first step in the process of
community development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks
and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult.
Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that
roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to
urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby
affected in many important respects. It is therefore to the interest of the
public, the developer and the future property owners that subdivisions be
conceived, designed, and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper
minimum standards.
   The following subdivision standards guiding the planning commission are
designed to provide for the harmonious development of the area; to secure a
coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to secure
adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage,
sewer, and other sanitary facilities.
   B.   Authority These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority
granted by Sections 13-3-401 through 13-3-411, 13-4-301 through 13-4-309, of
the Tennessee Code Annotated. The Planning Commission has fulfilled the
requirements set forth in these acts as prerequisite to the adoption of such
regulations, having filed a certified copy of the Major Thoroughfare Plan in
the office of the Register of Henry County, Tennessee on August 10, 1978, Deed
Book No. ______, Page No. ______.
   C.    Jurisdiction   These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land
within the corporate limits of Paris, Tennessee, and within the defined limits
of the Paris Planning Region as now or hereafter established. Within these
regulations the term "subdivision" shall mean the division of a tract or parcel
of land into two (2)   or more lots, sites, or divisions for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, and includes
resubdivision and, when appropriate to the context, relates to the context of
subdivision or to the land or area subdivided.
Any owner of land within this area wishing to subdivide land shall submit to
the Paris Regional Planning Commission a plat of the subdivision according to
the   procedures outlined in Article II, which plat shall conform to the
minimum requirements as set forth in Article III.
Improvements shall be installed as required by Article IV of these regulations.

ARTICLE II PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL
Plan Review Procedures
Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the Planning
Commission wishing to divide such land into two (2) or more lots, sites, or
divisions, each being five (5) acres or less in size, for the purpose, either
immediate or future, of sale or building shall submit a plan of such proposed
subdivision to the Paris Regional Planning Commission for approval and shall
obtain such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat for record.
Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to the minimum standards of design
for the subdivision of land as set forth in Article IV of these regulations and
shall be presented in the manner specified in the following sections of this
article. No plat of a subdivision of land within Paris Planning Region shall be
filed or recorded by the Registrar of Henry County without the approval of the
Planning Commission as specified herein. The filing or recording of a plat of a
subdivision without the approval of the Planning Commission, as required by
these regulations, is declared to be a misdemeanor punishable by law.
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of three
(3) steps: the first step is meeting with the Planning Commission and/or the
technical staff and review of the proposed sketch plan. The next step is the
submission to the Planning Commission of a construction plan of the proposed
subdivision. The third step is the preparation and submission to the Planning
Commission of a final plat together with required certificates. This final plat
becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the county register when
duly signed by the secretary of the Planning Commission.
   A.   Sketch Plan   The subdivider may consult early and informally with the
Planning Commission and its technical staff for advice and assistance before
the preparation of the preliminary sketch plat and its formal application for
approval. This will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with these
regulations, the Major Thoroughfare Plan and other official plans for public
improvements which might affect the area. Such informal review should prevent
unnecessary and costly revisions.
   B.   Construction Plan   In order to secure review and approval by the
Planning Commission of a proposed subdivision, the prospective subdivider
shall, prior to the making of any street improvements or installations of
utilities, submit to the Planning Commission a construction plan. He may also
proceed with the preparation of the final plat and other documents required in
connection therewith as specified in Section C of this article and the
improvements set forth in Article IV.
   1.   At least fifteen (15)   days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission eleven (11)
copies of Construction Plan of the proposed subdivision.
   2.   The construction plan which shall meet the minimum standards of design
and the general requirements for the construction of public improvements as set
forth in Article III shall give the following information insofar as possible:
   a.   The proposed subdivision's name and location, the name (2) and address
(es) of the owner or owners, and the name of the designer of the plat who shall
be an engineer or surveyor approved by the Planning Commission.
   b.   Date, approximate north point, and graphic scale.
   c.   The location of existing and platted property line, existing streets,
buildings, water courses, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain pipes, water mains,
and any public utility easements, or lines, the present zoning classification,
if any, both on the land to be subdivided and on the adjoining land; and the
names of adjoining property owners or subdivisions.
   d.   Plans and profiles of proposed utility layouts (sewers, water, and
electricity) showing feasible connections to the existing utility systems.
Within the Planning Region when such connections are not practicable, any
proposed individual water supply and/or disposal system must be approved by the
county health department.
   e.   The proposed street names and the locations and dimensions of proposed
streets, alleys, easements, parks and other open spaces, reservations, lot
lines, building setback lines and utilities.
   f.   Contours at vertical intervals of not more than five (5) feet except
when specifically not required by the Planning Commission. All new developments
shall include base flood elevation data.
   g.   The acreage of the land to be subdivided.
   h.   Location sketch map showing relationship of subdivision site to area.
   i.   Plans of proposed drainage systems showing connections to existing
systems. Plans should include pipe size, slope and invert elevations as
appropriate. Drainage areas should be provided to ensure proper calculations.
   j.   Plans and profiles of proposed streets.
   3.   Within thirty (30) days after submission of the construction plan, the
Planning Commission will review it and indicate its approval, disapproval, or
approval subject to modifications. If a plat is disapproved, reasons for such
disapproval shall be stated in writing. If approved subject to modifications,
the nature of the required modifications will be indicated.
   4.   The approval of the construction plan by the Planning Commission will
not constitute acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated on the
sketch plan.
   5.   Failure of the Planning Commission to act on the construction plan
within thirty (30) days will be deemed approval of this plat.
   6.   The approval of the construction plan shall lapse unless a final
platbased thereon is submitted within one (1) year from the date of such
approval unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Planning
Commission.
   C.   Final Plat
   1.   The final plat shall conform substantially to the construction plan as
approved; and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved construction plan which he proposed to record and
develop at the time, provided; however, that such portion conforms to all
requirements of these regulations.
   2.   At least fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered, the subdivider shall submit the original drawing in black drawing
ink and eleven (11) copies, (blue line) together with any street profiles or
other plans that may be required by the Planning Commission.
The plat shall be drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals one
hundred (100) feet on sheets not larger than 24 x 36 inches, or of an approved
size to correspond to local plat book dimensions. When more than one (1) sheet
is required, an index sheet of the same size shall be filed showing the entire
subdivision with the sheets lettered in alphabetical order as a key.
   3.   The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove. Approval shall be
indicated on the final plat through the signature of the Planning Commission
Secretary. A certification of action shall be issued by the Planning Commission
noting approval or disapproval, modifications to which the approval is subject,
and if disapproved, a list of reasons for disapproval.
   4.   Approval of the final plat shall require:
   a.   The lines of all streets and roads, alley lines, lot lines, building
setback lines, lots numbered in numerical order, reservations for easements,
and any areas to be dedicated to public use or sites for other than residential
use with notes stating their purpose and any limitations.
   b.   Sufficient data to determine readily and reproduce on the ground the
location, bearing and length of every street line, lot line, boundary line,

   e.   The names and locations of adjoining subdivision and streets and the
location and ownership of adjoining unsubdivided property.
   f.   Date, title, name and location of subdivision, graphic scale, and true
north point.
   g.   Location sketch map showing site in relation to area.
   h.   Payment at the time the final plat is submitted for approval of a fee
of seventeen dollars ($17.00) per page for the plat to be recorded by the
Planning Commission in the Register's Office of Henry County, Tennessee. In the
event that the recording fee per page for recording of a subdivision plat shall
increase, the fee required by this section shall automatically increase in an
amount equal to the plat recording fee per page, as certified by the Register's
Office of Henry County, Tennessee, without the necessity of further amendments
to this section. (Ord. # 1010, 03/06/03).
   5.   The following certificates* shall be presented with the final plat:
   a.   Certification showing that applicant is the land owner and dedicates

Commission.
   6.   No building permit shall be issued until the final plat is approved by
the Planning Commission.
   7.   No occupancy permit shall be issued until the building inspector has
determined that the development as constructed meets all of the requirements of
the approved final plat.
   8.   The applicant may submit a final plat without first submitting a
construction plan if all information required on the construction plan is
included in the final plat.
*See the appendix for forms for final plat certification.
   D.   Improvements Bond   Prior to final plat approval and/or release of
improvements bond, an inspection sheet showing appropriate inspections and
dates they were performed of improvements installed by the developer must be
submitted to the Planning Commission.
ARTICLE III REVIEW PROCEDURE FOR MINOR SUBDIVISION PLATS
The subdivider shall submit to the Building Inspector the original tracing and

NOTE:   Within the Planning Region where septic tanks are to be used in a minor
subdivision, the Planning Commission shall require certificates of approval by
the Health Authority in which instance all requirements, submission of data
review, and approval procedures as applicable to major subdivisions shall
apply.
Provided, however, that no Health Authority certificate shall be required where
the properties affected by the minor subdivision still meet the minimum
requirements for building lots and/or where the tract to be subdivided does not
meet the minimum lot requirements under these regulations and is not intended
for building purposes, which shall be noted on the minor subdivision plat.
The Planning Commission shall check the plat for conformance to the rules and
regulations. Thereafter the Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the
plat. Approval shall be indicated on the plat through the signature of the
Planning Commission Secretary. A Certificate of Action shall be issued by the
Planning Commission noting approval or modifications to which the approval is
subject, and if disapproved, a list of reasons for disapproval.
If action is not taken by the Planning Commission within thirty (30) days from

greater than the required pavement width whichever is greater. Provided,
however, that the required right-of-way shall be 20 ft. greater than the
required pavement width on T-turnarounds or cul-de-sac streets that are a
maximum of 300 ft. or less where no extension of the street is possible by the
nature of the development, and the density of the development is such that a 50
ft. right-of-way is not required by the Planning Commission, but in no event
shall the right-of-way for such streets be less than 40 ft. In cases where
topography or other physical conditions make a street of the required minimum
width impracticable, the Planning Commission may modify the above requirements.
   5.   Additional Width on Existing Streets   Subdivisions that adjoin
existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above
minimum street width requirements as may be required by the Planning
Commission.
   a.   The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the
subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
   b.   When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street,
one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way, measured from the center line of
the existing roadway, shall be provided. In no case shall the resulting right-
of-way be less then fifty (50) feet.
   6.   Restriction of Access   When a tract fronts on an arterial street or
highway, the Planning Commission may require such lots to be provided with
frontage on a marginal access street.
   7.   Street Grades   Grades on arterial and high density streets shall not
exceed seven (7) percent. Grades on other streets may exceed seven (7) percent
but not ten (10) percent.
   8.   Horizontal Curves   Where a deflection angle of more than ten (10)
degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius
shall be introduced. On streets sixty (60) feet or more in width, the
centerline radius of curvature shall be not less than three hundred (300) feet;
on other streets, not less than one hundred (100) feet.
   9.   Vertical Curve   Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical
curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance of two hundred (200)
feet, said sight distance being measured from the driver's eyes, which are
assumed to be four and one-half (4-1/2) feet above the pavement surface, to an
object four (4) inches high on the pavement. Profiles of all streets showing
natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than (1) inch equals
one hundred (100) feet horizontal and one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet
vertical, may be required by the Planning Commission.
   10.   Intersection   Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles
as is possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty
(60) degrees.
   Property line radi at street intersection shall not be less than twenty (20)
feet, and where the angle of street intersection is less than seventy-five (75)
degrees, the Planning Commission may require a greater curb radius. Wherever
necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius
without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width,
the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back
sufficiently to permit such construction.
   11.   Tangents   A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet in length
shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
   12.   Street Jogs   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one
hundred twenty five (125) feet shall not be allowed.
   13.   Dead-End Streets
   a.   Cul-de-sacs or courts designated to have one end permanently closed
shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway
diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at
least one hundred (100) feet.
   The Planning Commission may approve an alternative design such as the T-
backaround, the pavement of which shall be at least 60 feet across the T and 20
feet wide and have a right-of-way of at least 80 feet across the T and at least
40 feet in width as shown in illustration 5.
   b.   In the case of temporary cul-de-sacs where, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining
property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of
such property. Such dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turn-
around having a roadway diameter equal to the width of the right-of-way.
   14.   Private Streets and Reserve Strips   There shall be no private streets
platted in any subdivision. Every subdivided property shall be served from a
publicly dedicated street or permanent easement, as defined in Article I,
Section D., and as regulated in Article V., Section A (10) of this Resolution.
(Resolution # 1261, 6/13/96). There shall be no reserve strips controlling
access to streets, except where control of such strips is definitely placed
with the community under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.
   15.   Street Names   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with
others already existing and named, shall bear the names of existing streets. In
no case shall the names for proposed streets duplicate existing street names or
have names that rhyme or sound similar, such as having the same prefix or
suffix such as on Hills, Drive, Avenue, Cove or other final designations,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, driveway,
place or court.
Through its index list of street names on file the Planning Commission can
assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication.
   16.   Drainage   All streets and roads must be so designed as to provide for
the discharge of surface water from the right-of-way of all streets and roads
by grading and drainage as shall be approved by the Planning Commission. Where
it is the opinion of the Planning Commission that the water cannot be
adequately discharged by surface drainage, the Planning Commission may require
the installation of a storm sewer system.
   17.   Erosion Control   For the purpose of retaining valuable top soil, and
ensuring against siltation of roadways, floodways, and street beds, all grading
and excavation shall conform to the Standard Excavation and Grading Code as
adopted by the Paris City Commission.
   18.   Alleys   Alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for
business purposes, and shall not be provided in residential blocks except where
the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the Planning Commission of the
need for alleys.
   B.   Blocks
   1.   Length   Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) nor more than
twelve hundred (1200) feet in length except as the Planning Commission
considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of
street pattern.
   2   .Width   Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) rows of lots of
minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets and roads or prevented by
topographical conditions or size of the property; in which case the Planning
Commission will approve a single row of lots of minimum depth.
   C.   Lots
   1.   Arrangement   In so far as practical, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to straight street lines or radical to curved street lines. Each lot
must front upon a public street or road or permanent easement, as defined in
Article I, Section D., and as regulated in Article V, Section A (10) of this
Resolution, and said lot shall have a minimum of 50 feet road frontage
(Resolution # 1261, 6/13/96).
   2.   Minimum Size   The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as
the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated. Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect with such sewer and provide a connection to each lot.
Where a public sewer is not accessible, an alternative method of sewage
disposal may be used, if it meets all applicable public health regulations.
   a.   Residential lots not served by a public sewerage system shall comply
with local health regulations to govern subsurface sewage disposal system.
Copies of this regulation can be obtained from the county health
environmentalist office.
   b.   Greater area may be required for private sewage disposal if, in the
opinion of the county health officer, there are factors of drainage, soil
conditions or other conditions to cause potential health problems. The Planning
Commission may require that data from percolation tests be submitted as a basis
for passing upon subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage
disposal.
   c.   The minimum size of residential lots to be served by a private source
of water supply shall be determined by the county health officer after
investigations of soil conditions, proposed sewerage system and depth of ground
water. In no case shall lots served by a private water supply and private
sewage disposal system be less than the area required in the local health
regulations to govern subsurface sewage disposal systems.
   d.   Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial
properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking
facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Minimum
requirements for these facilities shall be as authorized in the zoning
ordinance. In absence of any zoning ordinance the Planning Commission shall
determine minimum requirements.
   e.   The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the minimum
requirements of any zoning ordinance in effect. Provided, however, that those
lots with proposed road frontage less than that required by the Zoning
Ordinance that meet the road frontage requirements of IV.C.1. will be allowed
if the lot meets the square footage requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and
conforms to the lot width requirements of the Zoning Ordinance at the proposed
building setback line. In absence of any zoning ordinance the Planning
Commission shall determine minimum requirements.
   3.   Building Setback Lines   The minimum depth of building setback lines
from the street shall be not less than thirty (30) feet and in the case of
corner lots, twenty (20) feet from the side street, unless higher standards are
required by an existing zoning ordinance.
   D.   Public Use and Service Areas   Due consideration shall be given to the
allocation of areas suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds and
parks for local or neighborhood use as well as for use as public service areas.
   1.   Public Open Spaces   For the purpose of providing for adequate public
land, the Planning Commission may require the dedication or reservation of
usable open space within a subdivision up to ten (10) percent of the gross area
or water frontage of the subdivision may be dedicated for parks, schools,
recreation or other public purposes. Where such reservations are required they
shall be noted on the final plat.
   2.   Easements for Utilities   Except where alleys are permitted for the
purpose, the Planning Commission may require easements, not exceeding twenty
(20) feet in width, for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas,
water, and heat mains or other utility lines, along all rear lot lines, along
side lot lines if necessary or if, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
advisable. Easements of the same or greater width may be required along the
lines of or across lots, where necessary for the extension of existing or
planned utilities.
   3.   Community Assets   In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for
all natural features such as large trees, water courses, and for historical
spots and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness
and value to the property. The location of shrubs, flowers, trees, etc. shall
be in conformance with the zoning ordinance in effect. In absence of a zoning
ordinance the Planning Commission shall determine the location specifications.
   E.   Suitability of the Land   The Planning Commission shall not approve the
subdivision of land if, from adequate investigations conducted by all public
agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the
public the site is not suitable for platting and development purposes of the
kind proposed.
   Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable
shall not be platted for residential occupancy, or for any other uses that may
increase flood hazard, endanger health, life or property or aggravate erosion.
Such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as will not produce
unsatisfactory living conditions. Also, if such land is shown on the City or
County Federal Insurance Administration Flood Hazard Area maps as being
potential flood hazard areas, it shall be so indicated on subdivider's plat.
All subdivision proposals greater than five (5) acres or 50 lots shall include
base flood elevation data.
   Fill may not be used to raise land in areas subject to flood unless the fill
proposed does not restrict the flow of water and unduly increase flood heights.
   F.   Large Tracts or Parcels   When land is subdivided into larger parcels
than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for
the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision.
   G.   Group Housing Developments   A comprehensive group housing development,
including the large scale construction of housing units together with necessary
drives and ways of access, may be approved by the Planning Commission although
the design of the project does not include standard street, lot and subdivision
arrangements, if departure from the foregoing standards can be made without
destroying their intent.
   H.   Individual Mobile Home Parks and Subdivisions   The requirements and
regulations of "the City of Paris Mobile Home Ordinance" shall be satisfied and
the approval of the local health authority must be secured prior to approval by
the Planning Commission of any mobile home or travel trailer park.
   A mobile home subdivision shall meet the general requirements of these
regulations prior to the approval of any plat and before the sale or lease of
any individual mobile home lots.
   I.   Variances   Variances may be granted under the following conditions:
   1.   Where the subdivider can show that strict adherence to these
regulations would cause unnecessary hardship, or:
   2.   Where the Planning Commission decides that there are topographical or
other conditions peculiar to the site, and a departure from these regulations
will not destroy their intent.
   3.   Where the design can be proven to be in accordance with current
editions of engineering design standards, i.e. ASSHTO.
Any variance thus authorized shall be stated in writing in the minutes of the
Planning Commission with the reasoning on which the departure is justified set
forth.
   J.   Zoning or Other Regulations   No final plat of land within the force
and effect of an existing zoning ordinance shall be approved unless it conforms
to such ordinance.
   Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions
noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, building code, or other
official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.
   K.   Water Supply System   Design of the water supply system shall conform
to the requirements contained in the "Local Government Public Works Standards
and Specifications", as amended, Section 100. Water Distribution Systems
(Design Criteria) and Section 02713 - Water Distribution System (Construction
Specifications). The water supply system shall be inspected by the Paris Board
of Public Utilities.
   L.   Sanitary Sewers   Design of the sanitary sewer system shall conform the
requirements contained in the "Local Government Public Works Standards and
Specifications", as amended, Section 200 - Sewerage Systems (Design Criteria)
and Section 02722 - Sanitary Sewerage Systems (Construction Specifications).
The sanitary sewer system shall be inspected by the Paris Board of Public
Utilities.
   M.   Drainage   Design of the drainage system shall conform to the
requirements contained in the "Local Government Public Works Standards and
Specification", as amended, Section 300 - Drainage Systems (Design Criteria)
and Section 02721 - Storm Drainage System (Construction Specifications). The
drainage system shall be inspected by the City Manager or his designated
representative.
ARTICLE V.   DEVELOPMENT PREREQUISITE TO FINAL APPROVAL
A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a
prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw
acreage into lots suitable for building purposes and human habitation. The
City, working with the developer, will develop subdivisions to produce
additional tax revenue and reduce future tax liability to the citizens of
Paris. Improvements by the subdivider spare the community a potential tax
liability. The following tangible improvements or provisions for their
estimated cost are required before final plat approval in order to assure the
physical reality of a subdivision which approval and recordation will establish
legally.
   A.   Required Improvements   Every subdivision developer shall be required
to grade and improve streets and alleys, and install sewers, storm water
inlets, water mains and monuments in accordance with the "Local Government
Public Works Standards and Specifications" as modified or where the design can
be proven to be in accordance with current editions of engineering design
standards, etc., i.e. ASSHTO. Improvements to be inspected by the City Manager
or his designated representative unless otherwise specified.
   1.   Monuments
   a.   Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter or four (4) inches
square, three (3) feet long, with a flat top, shall be set at all street
corners, at all points where the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries
of the subdivision, and at angle points and points of curve in each street. The
top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the
location and shall be set flush with the finished grade.
   b.   All lot corners shall be marked with appropriate monuments.
   2.   Grading   All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded to their full
width by the subdividers so that pavements and sidewalks can be constructed to
the required cross section. Deviation from the above, due to special
topographical conditions, will be allowed only with special approval of the
Planning Commission. All grading and excavation shall conform to the Standard
Excavation and Grading Code adopted by the Paris City Commission.
   a.   Preparation   Before grading is started the entire right-of-way area
shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable
materials and all trees not intended for preservation.
   b.   Cuts   All tree stumps, boulders and other obstructions shall be
removed to a depth of two (2) feet below the subgrade. Rock, when encountered
shall be sacrificed to a depth of twelve (12) inches below the subgrade. Banks
that have been cut shall be sodded or seeded according to their grade.
   c.   Fill   All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the
construction of fills, approaches, or other places as needed. Excess materials,
including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed from the
development site. The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed twelve (12)
inches loose and compacted by a sheep's foot roller. The filling of utility
trenches and other places not accessible to a roller shall be mechanically
tamped, but where water is used to assist compaction the water content shall
not exceed the optimum of moisture.
   3.   Storm Drainage   An adequate drainage system, designed and certified by
a registered professional engineer or professional surveyor, including
necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets,
bridges, etc. shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water.
All open ditches used for storm drainage must be seeded or sodded according to
their grade.
Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall
be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required slopes.
The size openings to be provided shall be determined by Manning Formula but in
no case shall the pipe be less than twelve (12) inches in diameter. Cross
drains shall be built on straight lines and grade, and shall be laid on a firm
base but not on solid rock. Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in
the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight
joints and a smooth uniform invert. They shall be placed at a sufficient depth
below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall
the top of the pipe be less than one (1) foot below the roadbed.
Note:   Charts and standards are in the "Local Government Public Works
Standards and Specification", as amended, Section 300-Drainage Systems, page 13
and the following charts in 314-Drainage System.
The subdivider shall be responsible for the cost and installation of the storm
drainage system. The storm drainage system shall be inspected by the City
Manager or his designated representative.
   4.   Roadway Improvements   Roadway improvements shall be constructed as set
forth in Section 02513 of the "Local Government Public Works Standards and
Specifications," as modified, except where the design can be proven to be in
accordance with current editions of engineering design standard, etc., i.e.
ASSHTO, and as set forth below:
   a.   Base   A compacted gravel base course eight (8) inches deep and three
(3) feet wider than the width of the pavement on each side of the street shall
be installed on all streets, including cul-de-sacs, temporary turn-arounds and
access streets to adjoining properties according to specifications set forth in
Section 02513 - 2.03 of the "Local Government Public Works Standards and
Specifications as modified. Before any base is installed, the dirt subgrade
shall be inspected and approved by the City Manager and/or the Street
Supervisor.
   b.   Curbs and Gutters   Curbs and gutters shall not be required on any
street in the development other than the high density streets. All cost shall
be paid by the developer. See Section 402, Streets Standard Drawings, drawing
CGD-3 of the "Local Government Public Works Standards and Specifications as
modified except where the design can be proven to be in accordance with current
editions of engineering design standard, etc., i.e. ASSHTO.)
   Backfill shall be towards the street and be higher than the curb or street
to insure drainage of surface water into the drainage system.
   One-half (1/2) inch to three-fourths (3/4) inch expansion and contraction
joints for the curbs and gutters, where required, shall be placed at intervals
not exceeding sixty (60) feet.
   In the region, as the drainage system, the Planning Commission may accept
swales on streets where the finished grade does not exceed two (2) percent.
Where side swales are used the slopes must not exceed one vertical foot to
three feet horizontally and all slopes must be seeded or sodded to prevent
erosion as set forth in Section 02485 - Lawn and Grass Landscaping of the
"Local Government Public Works Standards and Specification", as amended.
   c.   Roadway Surfacing   Within the City the developer shall be responsible
for two (2) inches of hot mix type surface street that meets TDOT
specifications shall be accepted on any street within the development. Before
any asphalt is applied on the base, the base material must be inspected by the
City Manager and the Street Superintendent. Within the Paris Planning Region,
the developer shall, as a minimum, provide a Double Bituminous surface
Treatment (DBST) meeting TDOT specifications. FAILURE OF THE DEVELOPER TO GET
ANY OF THE APPROPRIATE INSPECTIONS DONE BY THE CITY MANAGER OR THE STREET
SUPERINTENDENT SHALL CAUSE THE STREET TO BE CORE DRILLED EVERY ONE HUNDRED
(100) FEET AND CERTIFIED BY A CERTIFIED AND APPROVED TESTING LABORATORY WITH
THE EXPENSE BEING PAID BY THE DEVELOPER.
   d.   All ditches and trenches are to be backfilled with sand or washed
stone.
   e.   The Planning Commission may specify additional requirements for road
improvements if warranted by the type soil where the street or road is to be
developed.
   5.   Minimum Pavement Widths
   a.   Arterial Streets…..(Not paved by developer)
   b.   High Density Streets………………...36 feet

considerable traffic, or as may be directed by the Planning Commission.
   d.   Low Density Streets…………………20 feet
   Maximum length 1200 feet or 25 dwelling units or as defined by development
density.
   6.   Sidewalks   
   a.   Intent   For the safety of pedestrians and/or children at play,
installation of sidewalks shall be required on arterial or high density streets
under the following terms and conditions.
   b.   Location   Sidewalks shall be located not less than 24 inches from the
curb line to provide a buffer between the pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The
buffer area between the curb line and the sidewalk shall be covered in living
landscape such as grass, or other ground covers of non-living (artificial)
landscape material such as rocks, pebbles, sand, gravel, stone or mulch.
   c.   Size   A sidewalks shall be four (4) feet wide and four (4) inches
thick. Designs and construction of sidewalks shall conform to the standards as
included in the Local Government Public Works Standards and Specifications
adopted by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Paris, Tennessee.
   d.   Number of Sidewalks Required   Sidewalks shall be required on one side
of any new development on arterial and/or collector streets showing
connectivity at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
   e.   Exceptions
Waiver Criteria   Where the provisions of this section are applicable, the
Planning Commission may waive the requirement of sidewalks under the following
terms and conditions:
   1)   The developer can justify to the Planning Commission that strict
compliance with the terms of this chapter would not be in the best interest of
the citizens of Paris.
   2)   Such a waiver by the Planning Commission shall be based on a finding of
no present or future use and/or need for such sidewalks. Character of the
development, financial burden, economic hardship, or topography shall not be
valid criteria for granting such a waiver.
   f.   Inspections shall be conducted by the City Manager or his designated
representative.
   7.   Installation of Utilities   After grading is completed and approved and
before any base is applied, all of the underground work, water mains, gas
mains, etc., and all service connections shall be installed completely and
approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. All
driveways for houses to be built by the developer shall be cut and drained.
Within flood prone areas new and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to eliminate or minimize flood damage. Trenches and ditches shall be
backfilled with sand or washed stone. All utilities shall be extended to the
farthest extreme of the development.
   8.   Water Supply System   Water mains shall be properly connected with the
community water supply system or with an alternative supply approved by the
county health officer and shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve
adequately for both domestic use and fire protection to all lots shown on the
subdivision plat.
Water mains for a community water supply system shall be no less than six (6)
inches in diameter and the Planning Commission may require larger mains if they
are needed to serve future extensions. The location and types of valves and
hydrants, the amount of soil cover over the pipes and other features of the
installation shall be approved by the Planning Commission. Fire hydrants shall
be installed in all developments so that there is no more than 500 feet between
hydrants. (Ord. # 1083, 05/01/08). All systems shall be designed to minimize
the infiltration of flood water.
The developer shall be responsible for installing individual lot services to
property line consisting of connection to main, service tubing, curb stop and
meter box. (See Section 108 Design Criteria - Water Distribution System -
Standard Drawing No. SCC-1.) Inspections shall be conducted by the Paris Board
of Public Utilities.
   9.   Sanitary Sewers   When located within or adjacent to a public sewerage
system, sanitary sewer mains no less than eight (8) inches in diameter and of a
type approved by the Planning Commission shall be installed in such a manner as
to serve all lots with connection to the public system. All systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of, or discharges from flood
waters.
The developer shall be responsible for installing individual lot services to
property line consisting of connection to main and service pipe with plumb (See
Section 210 Design Criteria - Wastewater System Standard Drawing No. SCC-1.)
The City Commission may issue a resolution including provisions for
reimbursement for private construction of water and sewer to residential
subdividers to promote a population growth in the City of Paris.
   10.   Permanent Easements, Vehicular   A permanent vehicular easement may be
permitted under certain conditions. These easements shall meet the following
minimum requirements and any special conditions attached by the Planning
Commission, and the requirements and special conditions for the easement shall
be placed on the final plat for recording:
   a.   A permanent easement shall be of a required width of no less than fifty
(50) feet; however, the Planning Commission may require greater widths if
necessary to meet special conditions present on a plat.
   b.   A permanent easement providing legal access to more than one lotshall
be improved to meet the road construction standards established in Article V of
these regulations.
   c.   Permanent easement improvements shall be maintained by the developer/
owner or by a legally established home owners association or other similar
group approved by the Planning Commission. The legal documents establishing the
easement shall be submitted with the final plat for review and approval and
shall be recorded with the final plat.
   d.   If, at any future date, a permanent easement is submitted for
acceptance as a public street or road, it shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for approval. In considering the easement for approval as a public
street or road, the Planning Commission shall require the improvements to the
easement to meet the minimum street construction standards in effect at the
time the request for public acceptance is made.
   e.   A building permit may be issued for a building to be located on a
recorded lot of record as of 6/13/96, which lot fronts on a permanent easement
with access to an existing public street or road; provided, however, that any
future subdivision of said lot shall be subject to these provisions (Resolution
# 1261, 6/13/96).
   B.   Recommended Improvements   The planting of street trees and
installation of street name signs is considered a duty of the subdivider as
well as good business practice.
   1.   Street Trees   Street trees are a protection against excessive heat and
glare and enhance the attractiveness and value of abutting property. The
Planning Commission will assist the subdivider in location of trees and species
to use under varying conditions.
It is recommended that trees be planted inside the property lines where they
are less subject to injury, less likely to cause motor accidents and enjoy more
favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted within a planting
strip in the right-of-way, their proposed locations and species to be used must
be submitted for the Planning Commission's approval since the public inherits
the care and maintenance of such trees. Any trees or shrubs planted shall
conform to the zoning regulations and if no zoning is in effect the Planning
Commission shall set minimum standards for protection from obstructions to
vision at intersections and exits from driveways.
   2.   Street Name Signs   Appropriate street signs also add sales value to
land subdivisions and enable strangers, delivery concerns and even potential
lot buyers to find their way around. Street names should appear at all
intersections. Upon request the Planning Commission will aid the subdivider
with specifications for the construction, placing and setting of such signs.
   C.   Guarantees in Lieu of Completed Improvements No final subdivision plat
shall be approved by the Planning Commission or accepted for record by the
county registrar of deeds until one of the following conditions has been met:
   1.   All required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory
manner and approved by the Paris Municipal-Regional Planning Commission, or
   2.   An escrow account has been established or a security bond has been
posted and accepted by the Planning Commission in an amount equal to the
estimated cost of installation of the required improvements, whereby
improvements may be made and utilities installed without cost to the City and/
or County in event of default of the subdivider.
Estimated costs are to be obtained by the developers from the public utility
company, the local gas company, the county road department or city street
department or other body as shall be specified by the Planning Commission.

APPENDIX
SUGGESTED STEPS FOR A DEVELOPER OF A SUBDIVISION
Confer with the Planning Commission and its staff representative to become
thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements, the major thoroughfare
plan, and other public improvements which might affect the area to be
subdivided, before undertaking any site planning.
Have preliminary sketch plat prepared by a reputable engineer, land planner or
landscape architect.
Discuss preliminary plat with the Planning Commission's professional staff.
This pre-application review by a trained land planner may save the subdivider
time and costly revisions as well as possible savings through possible better
design.
Submit two copies of the sketch plat to the Planning Commission for preliminary
approval at least five days before their regular meeting to permit the required
review.
WHEN PRELIMINARY APPROVAL HAS BEEN GRANTED:
See state or county highway officials and/or city engineer, as required, for
street and utility specification; contact county health officials for septic
tank and disposal field specifications if public sewers and/or public water are
not available.
Develop subdivision according to preliminary plat and required modifications,
if any. Install improvements.
Obtain certificate of accuracy from approved surveyor or engineer. Obtain
certificates from street and health officials certifying that improvements have
been made or that a performance bond has been posted, or that a contract
between the subdivider and the municipality has been secured to insure required
improvements.
Prepare final plat.
Submit original and three copies of the final plat to the Planning Commission
for approval. When approved, the Planning Commission secretary will sign the
necessary certificate of approval for recording.
The subdivider now records the plat with the county registrar's office. He is
now ready to sell his lots.
