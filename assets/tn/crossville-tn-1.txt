end of the section references the private acts from which the amendments
derive. Footnotes in appropriate places provide information which aid the
reader in the interpretation of the charter or understanding its present
structure.
   No changes have been made in the contents of the charter or its amendments
incorporated therein except that catchlines and a table of contents have been
added to facilitate easy reference.
   It is important to note that this is a careful but unofficial compilation of
the charter.

until later approved by voters, amending what had been Art. IV, sec. 5 and is
now Art. IV, sec. 4. There is currently no sec. 5 in Article IV because Priv.

the several wards so that residents of each shall vote in the ward where he
lives, the election shall be held and the voting places designated accordingly
by the County Election Commission. (As amended by Priv. Acts 2014, ch. 55, sec.
1)

Acts 2014, ch. 55, sec. 1)

Section 6. Recall.
Be it further enacted, that any person holding an elective office of the City,
whether by election, succession, or appointment to fill a vacancy, shall be
subject to removal from office at a recall election in the manner provided
herein.
   (1)   A recall of an incumbent of an elective office shall be initiated upon
a petition signed by the registered voters of the City of Crossville. The Mayor
and all councilmen currently in office or hereafter elected shall be subject to
recall and the petition shall contain signatures equal in number to at least
thirty-three percent (33%) of the registered voters for the City of Crossville
on the date of the city election preceding the filing of the petition. Every
recall petition shall name the officer against whom it is directed.
   (2)   Each elector signing a recall petition shall add to his signature, his
residence, and the date of signing. Signatures on a recall petition may be on
separate sheets but each sheet shall have appended to it the affidavit of some
person, not necessarily a signer of the petition, that to the best of the
affiant's knowledge and belief the persons whose signatures appear on the sheet
are registered voters of the City.
   (3)   A recall petition shall be tendered for filing to the Cumberland
County Commissioners of Elections. Those persons filing a recall petition shall
also file a cash bond with the Cumberland County Election Commission, equal to
the cost of the proposed election. The cash bond or the unused portion thereof
shall be refunded to those persons if the recall petition is determined to be
invalid, the incumbent resigns before the Election Commission calls the recall
election, or before the election is held. The Election Commission shall examine
the petition to see whether it contains a sufficient number of apparently
genuine signatures. The Election Commission may question the genuineness of any
signature or signatures appearing on the recall petition and if it shall find
that any such signature or signatures are not genuine, it shall disregard them
in determining whether the petition contains a sufficient number of signatures.
The Election Commission shall eliminate any sheet of the petition which is not
accompanied by the required affidavit. The invalidity of any sheet of the
petition shall not affect the validity of the petition if a sufficient number
of signatures remain after eliminating such an invalid sheet. The Election
Commission shall complete its examination of the petition within thirty (30)
days and shall thereupon file the petition if valid, or reject it if invalid.
   (4)   As soon as the Commissioners of Elections of Cumberland County have
accepted a recall petition for filing, the chairman of the Election Commission
shall notify the incumbent named in the petition that the petition has been
filed. Upon receipt of such notice the incumbent may resign from his office and
thereupon the recall proceedings shall terminate.
   (5)   If the incumbent against whom a recall petition is directed does not
resign from his office within ten (10) days after notice of the filing of such
petition has been given to the incumbent, the Cumberland County Commissioners
of Elections shall arrange a recall election. If a regular or special election
is to be held not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days
after the ten (10) days have expired, the recall question shall be placed
before the voters at such an election. Otherwise a special recall election
shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty (30) days nor more than
ninety (90) days after the ten (10) days have expired. The incumbent against
whom a recall petition is directed may resign at any time prior to the recall
election and thereupon the election shall not be held.
   (6)   The following question shall be presented to each elector in a recall
election: "Shall (name of officer) be recalled and removed from the office of
(name of office)?" The above question shall appear as to every officer whose
recall is to be voted on and provision shall be made for the elector to vote
"Yes" or "No".
   (7)   If sixty-six percent (66%) of the registered voters who vote on the
question at a recall election vote "Yes", the incumbent shall be deemed
recalled and removed from office, but if a majority of the registered voters
vote "No" the incumbent shall remain in office.
   (8)   No person who has been removed from an elective office by a recall
election or who has resigned from such an office after a recall petition
directed to him has been filed, shall be eligible for election or appointment
to any office of the City within two (2) years after his removal or
resignation.
   (9)   No recall petition shall be filed against any incumbent of an elective
office within the first year or the last six (6) months of the term of his
office or within six (6) months after an unsuccessful recall election against
him, but an officer who has been reelected for a successive term shall be
subject to recall also during the first year of such term. (Priv. Acts 2014,
ch. 83, sec. 1)

action shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or
made such payment or incurred such obligation, and he shall also be liable to

or employee or a designated family member is negotiating possible employment
with a person or organization that is the subject of the vote or that is to be
regulated or supervised.
   (C)   In any situation in which a personal interest is also a conflict of
interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over
the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1131, passed 6-12-2007)
§ 1-703 DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INTEREST BY OFFICIAL WITH VOTE.
   (A)   An official with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall

act, that he or she would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing,

contrary, an official or employee may accept, directly or indirectly, money,
gifts, gratuities or other consideration in amounts not to exceed $100 per

consideration is not in exchange for the performance of an act, or the
refraining from the performance of an act, that he or she would be expected to
perform, or refrain from performing, in the regular course of his or her
duties. Gifts, gratuities, money and consideration in amounts of $100 or less
per instance are hereby deemed to be too nominal to be interpreted reasonably
as an attempt to influence, as contemplated in division (A)(2) above; an
interpretation is hereby deemed to be unreasonable with regard to gifts, money,
gratuity and consideration in an amount of $100 or less per instance, and the
same shall not be interpreted as an attempt to influence, and shall be treated

a violation of this code of ethics.
      (2)   The City Attorney may request the City Council to hire another
attorney, individual or entity to act as ethics officer when he or she has or
will have a conflict on interests in a particular matter.
      (3)   When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this chapter is
lodged against a member of the City Council, the City Council shall either
determine that the complaint has merit, determine that the complaint does not
have merit or determine that the complaint has sufficient merit to warrant
further investigation. If the Council determines that a complaint warrants
further investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the City Attorney
or another individual or entity chosen by the City Council.
   (C)   The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances would
apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
   (D)   When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule or regulation or a civil service policy, rule or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel
or civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics.
(Ord. 1131, passed 6-12-2007)
§ 1-711 VIOLATIONS.

CHAPTER 8: PUBLIC RECORDS
Section
   
1-801   Procedures regarding access to an inspection of public records
§ 1-801 PROCEDURES REGARDING ACCESS TO AN INSPECTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (A)   Consistent with the Public Records Act of the State of Tennessee,
personnel of the City of Crossville shall provide full access and assistance in
a timely and efficient manner to Tennessee residents who request access to
public documents.
   (B)   Employees of the City of Crossville shall protect the integrity and
organization of public records with respect to the manner in which the records
are inspected and copied. All inspections of records must be performed under
the supervision of the records custodian or designee. All copying of public
records must be performed by employees of the city, or, in the event that city
personnel are unable to copy the records, by an entity or person designated by
the records custodian.
   (C)   To prevent excessive disruptions of the work, essential functions, and
duties of employees of the City of Crossville, persons requesting inspection
and/or copying of public records are requested to complete a records request
form to be furnished by the city. If the requesting party refuses to complete a
request form, a city employee shall complete the form with the information
provided by the requesting party. Persons requesting access to open public
records shall describe the records with specificity so that the records may be
located and made available for public inspection or duplication, as provided in
division (B) above. All requests for public records shall be directed to the
records custodian.
   (D)   When records are requested for inspection or copying, the records
custodian has up to seven business days to determine whether the city can
retrieve the records requested and whether the requested records contain any
confidential information, and the estimated charge for copying based upon the
number of copies and amount of time required. Within seven business days of a
request for records the records custodian shall:
      (1)   Produce the records requested;
      (2)   Deny the records in writing, giving explanation for denial; or,
      (3)   In the case of voluminous requests, provide, in writing, the
requestor with an estimated time frame for production and an estimation of
duplication costs.
   (E)   A public records policy shall be adopted by the City Council and
reviewed at a minimum of every two years, outlining the rules to give the
fullest possible access to public records.
   (F)   Requests requiring less than one hour of municipal employee labor for
research, retrieval, redaction and duplication will not result in an assessment
of labor charges to the requester. Employee labor in excess of one hour may be
charged to the requestor, in addition to the cost per copy, as provided in
division (E). The city may require payment in advance of producing any request.
Requests for copies of records may not be broken down to multiple requests for
the same information in order to qualify for the first free hour.
      (1)   For a request requiring more than one employee to complete, labor
charges will be assessed based on the following formula: In calculating the
charge for labor, a department head shall determine the number of hours each
employee spent producing a request. The department head shall then subtract the
one (1) hour threshold from the number of hours the highest paid employee(s)
spent producing the request. The department head will then multiply total
number of hours to be charged for the labor of each employee by that employee's
hourly wage. Finally, the department head will add together the totals for all
the employees involved in the request and that will be the total amount of
labor that can be charged.
      (2)   When the total number of requests made by a requestor within a
calendar month exceeds four (4), the requests will be aggregated, and the
requestor shall charge a fee for any and all labor that is reasonably necessary
to produce the copies of the requested records after informing the requestor
that the aggregation limit has been met. Request for items that are routinely
released and readily accessible, such as agendas for current calendar month
meetings and approved minutes from meetings held in the previous calendar
month, shall not be counted in the aggregated requests.
   (G)   If the city is assessed a charge to retrieve the requested records
from archives or any other entity having possession of requested records, the
records custodian may assess the requestor the cost assessed to the city.
   (H)   Upon completion of a records request the requestor may pick up the
copies of records at the office of the records custodian. Alternatively, the
requestor may choose to have the copies of records delivered via United States
Postal Service; provided that the requestor pays all related expenses in
advance.
   (I)   The Police Chief shall maintain in his office records of undercover
investigators containing personally identifying information. All other
personnel records of the police department shall be maintained in the office of
the records custodian. Requests for personnel records, other than for
undercover investigators, shall be made to the records custodian, who shall
promptly notify the Police Chief of such request. The Police Chief shall make
the final determination as to the release the information requested. In the
event that the Police Chief refuses to release the information, he shall
provide a written explanation of his reasons for not releasing the information.
   (J)   If the public records requested are frail due to age or other
conditions, and copying of the records will cause damage to the original
records, the requesting party may be required to make an appointment for
inspection.

4-405   Administrative procedure guidelines
§ 4-401 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter and referenced regulations is to bring the
city into compliance with Public Acts 1993, Chapter 433. This act requires
Tennessee municipalities to adopt travel and expense regulations covering
expenses incurred by "any Mayor and any member of the local governing body, and
any board or committee member elected or appointed by the Mayor or local
governing body, and any official or employee of the municipality whose salary
is set by charter or general law".
   (B)   In order to provide consistency in travel regulations and
reimbursement, this chapter is expanded to cover regular city employees. It is
the intent of this policy to assure fair and equitable treatment to all
individuals traveling on city business at city expense.
(1989 Code, § 4-401)
§ 4-402 ENFORCEMENT.
   The City Manager or his or her designee shall be responsible for the
enforcement of these travel regulations.
(1989 Code, § 4-402)
§ 4-403 GENERAL TRAVEL POLICY.
   (A)   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, the terms
TRAVELER or AUTHORIZED TRAVELER shall mean any elected or appointed municipal
officer or employee, including members of municipal boards and committees
appointed by the Mayor or the municipal governing policy, and the employees of
the boards and committees who are traveling on official municipal business and
whose travel was authorized in accordance with this chapter. AUTHORIZED
TRAVELER shall not include the spouse, children, other relatives, friends or
companions accompanying the authorized traveler on city business, unless the
person or persons otherwise qualify as an authorized traveler under this
chapter.
   (B)   Authorized travelers are entitled to reimbursement of certain
expenditures incurred while traveling on official business for the city.
Reimbursable expenses shall include expenses for transportation, lodging,
meals, registration fees, conferences, conventions, seminars and other actual
and necessary expenses related to official business as determined by the City
Manager. Under certain conditions, entertainment expenses may be eligible for
reimbursement.
   (C)   Authorized travelers can request either a travel advance for the
projected cost of authorized travel, or advance billing directly to the city
for registration fees, air fares, meals, lodging, conferences and similar
expenses. Travel advance requests are not considered documentation of travel
expenses. If travel advances exceed documented expense claims, immediate
reimbursement on the part of the authorized traveler is required. It will be
the responsibility of the City Manager to initiate action to recover any
undocumented travel advances.
   (D)   Travel advances are available only for special travel and only after
completion and approval of the "Travel Authorization and Reimbursement" form.
   (E)   The bottom section of the "Travel Authorization and Reimbursement"
form will be used to document all expense claims.
   (F)   To qualify for reimbursement, travel expenses must be:
      (1)   Directly related to the conduct of the city business for which
travel was authorized; and
      (2)   Actual, reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. The City
Manager may make exceptions for unusual circumstances. Expenses considered
excessive will be disallowed.
   (G)   All claims for travel expense reimbursements must be supported by an
original paid receipt for lodging, vehicle rental, phone call, public carrier
travel, conference fee and other reimbursable costs.
   (H)   Any person attempting to defraud the city or misuse city travel funds
is subject to legal action for recovery of fraudulent travel claims and/or
advances.
   (I)   Mileage and motel expenses incurred within the city will not
ordinarily be considered as expenses eligible for reimbursement.
(1989 Code, § 4-403)
§ 4-404 TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT RATE SCHEDULES.
   (A)   Authorized travelers shall be reimbursed according to the customary
and reasonable rates established in the Administrative Procedure Guidelines.

as meals, lodging and registration fees for conferences, conventions, seminars
and other education programs.
(1989 Code, § 4-404)
§ 4-405 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE GUIDELINES.
   The city adopts and incorporates by reference as if fully set out herein the
Administrative Procedure Guidelines, a copy of which is on file in the office
of the City Clerk. These guidelines may be amended by resolution of the City
Council.

§ 4-501 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the city to provide employees a place of
employment which is free from recognized hazards that may cause death or
serious physical harm. In providing services to the citizens of the city,
employees may come in contact with life-threatening infectious diseases which
can be transmitted through job related activities. It is important that both
citizens and employees are protected from the transmission of diseases just as
it is equally important that neither is discriminated against because of basic
misconceptions about various diseases and illnesses.
   (B)   The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive set of
rules and regulations governing the prevention of discrimination and potential
occupational exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB).
(1989 Code, § 4-501)
§ 4-502 COVERAGE.
   Occupational exposures may occur in many ways, including needle sticks, cut
injuries or blood spills. Several classes of employees are assumed to be at
high risk for blood borne infections due to their routinely increased exposure
to infectious material from potentially infected individuals. Those high risk
occupations include, but are not limited to:
   (A)   Paramedics, emergency medical technicians and first responders;
   (B)   Occupational nurses;
   (C)   Housekeeping and laundry workers;
   (D)   Police and security personnel;
   (E)   Firefighters;
   (F)   Sanitation and landfill workers; and
   (G)   Any other employee deemed to be at high risk per this policy and an
exposure determination.
(1989 Code, § 4-502)
§ 4-503 ADMINISTRATION.
   This infection control policy shall be administered by the City Manager who
shall have the following duties and responsibilities:
   (A)   Exercise leadership in implementation and maintenance of an effective
infection control policy subject to the provisions of this chapter, other
ordinances, the city charter and federal and state law relating to OSHA
regulations;
   (B)   Make an exposure determination for all employee positions to determine
a possible exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials;
   (C)   Maintain records of all employees and incidents subject to the
provisions of this chapter;
   (D)   Conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with the
infection control policy by municipal employees;
   (E)   Coordinate and document all relevant training activities in support of
the infection control policy;
   (F)   Prepare and recommend to the governing body any amendments or changes
to the infection control policy;
   (G)   Identify any and all housekeeping operations involving substantial
risk of direct exposure to potentially infectious materials and address the
proper precautions to be taken while cleaning rooms and blood spills; and
   (H)   Perform other duties and exercise other authority as may be prescribed
by the governing body.
(1989 Code, § 4-503)
§ 4-504 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BODY FLUID. Fluids that have been recognized by the Center for Disease
Control as directly linked to the transmission of HIV and/or HBV and/or to
which universal precautions apply: blood, semen, blood products, vaginal
secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, amniotic
fluid and concentrated HIV or HBV viruses.
   EXPOSURE. The contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials
to which universal precautions apply through contact with open wounds, non-
intact skin or mucous membranes during the performance of an individual's
normal job duties.
   HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV). A serious blood-borne virus with potential for
life-threatening complications. Possible complications include: massive hepatic
necrosis, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic active hepatitis and hepatocellular
carcinoma.
   HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV). The virus that causes acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted through sexual contact and
exposure to infected blood or blood components and perinatally from mother to
neonate.
   TUBERCULOSIS (TB). An acute or chronic communicable disease that usually
affects the respiratory system, but may involve any system in the body.
   UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS. Refers to a system of infectious disease control
which assumes that every direct contact with body fluid is infectious and
requires every employee exposed to direct contact with potentially infectious
materials to be protected as though the body fluid were HBV or HIV infected.
(1989 Code, § 4-504)
§ 4-505 POLICY STATEMENT.
   (A)   All blood and other potentially infectious materials are infectious
for several blood-borne pathogens. Some body fluids can also transmit
infections. For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control developed the
strategy that everyone should always take particular care when there is a
potential exposure. These precautions have been termed "universal precautions".
   (B)   Universal precautions stress that all persons should be assumed to be
infectious for HIV and/or other blood-borne pathogens. Universal precautions
apply to blood, tissues and other potentially infectious materials. Universal
precautions also apply to semen, (although occupational risk or exposure is
quite limited), vaginal secretions and to cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural,
peritoneal, pericardial and amniotic fluids. Universal precautions do not apply
to feces, nasal secretions, human breast milk, sputum, saliva, sweat, tears,
urine and vomitus unless these substances contain visible blood.
(1989 Code, § 4-505)
§ 4-506 GENERAL GUIDELINES.
   General guidelines which shall be used by everyone include:
   (A)   Notify the immediate supervisor and the personnel department of the
contact incident and details thereof and seek immediate medical attention;
   (B)   Keep all open cuts and abrasions covered with adhesive bandages which
repel liquids;
   (C)   Soap and water kill many bacteria and viruses on contact. If hands are
contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials to which
universal precautions apply, wash immediately and thoroughly. Hands shall also
be washed after gloves are removed even if the gloves appear to be intact. When
soap and water or hand washing facilities are not available, use a waterless
antiseptic hand cleaner according to the manufacturer's recommendation for the
product;
   (D)   All workers shall take precautions to prevent injuries caused by
needles, scalpel blades and other sharp instruments. To prevent needle stick
injuries, needles shall not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand,
removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. After they
are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharp items
shall be placed in puncture resistant containers for disposal. The puncture
resistant container shall be located as close as practical to the use area;
   (E)   (1)   The city will provide gloves of appropriate material, quality
and size for each affected employee. The gloves are to be worn when there is
contact (or when there is a potential contact) with blood or other potentially
infectious materials to which universal precautions apply:
         (a)   While handling an individual where exposure is possible;
         (b)   While cleaning or handling contaminated items or equipment; and
         (c)   While cleaning up an area that has been contaminated with one of
the above.
      (2)   Gloves shall not be used if they are peeling, cracked or
discolored, or if they have punctures, tears or other evidence of
deterioration. Employee shall not wash or disinfect surgical or examination
gloves for reuse.
   (F)   Resuscitation equipment shall be used when necessary. (No transmission
of HBV or HIV infection during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation has been
documented.) Because of the risk of salivary transmission of other infectious
diseases and the theoretical risk of HIV or HBV transmission during artificial
resuscitation, bags shall be used. Pocket mouth-to-mouth resuscitation masks
designed to isolate emergency response personnel from contact with a victims'
blood and blood contaminated saliva, respiratory secretion and vomitus, are
available to all personnel who provide or potentially provide emergency
treatment;
   (G)   Masks or protective eyewear or face shields shall be worn during
procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other potentially
infectious materials to prevent exposure to mucous membranes of the mouth, nose
and eyes. They are not required for routine care;
   (H)   Gowns, aprons or lab coats shall be worn during procedures that are
likely to generate splashes of blood or other potentially infectious materials;
   (I)   Areas and equipment contaminated with blood shall be cleaned as soon
as possible. A household (chlorine) bleach solution (one part chlorine to ten
parts water) shall be applied to the contaminated surface as a disinfectant
leaving it on for at least 30 seconds. A solution must be changed and remixed
every 24 hours to be effective;
   (J)   Contaminated clothing (or other articles) shall be handled carefully
and washed as soon as possible. Laundry and dish washing cycles at 120° F. are
adequate for decontamination;
   (K)   Place all disposable equipment (gloves, masks, gowns and the like) in
a clearly marked plastic bag. Place the bag in a second clearly marked bag
(double bag). Seal and dispose of by placing in a designated "hazardous"
dumpster. NOTE: Sharp objects must be placed in an impervious container and
properly disposed;
   (L)   Tags shall be used as a means of preventing accidental injury or
illness to employees who are exposed to hazardous or potentially hazardous
conditions, equipment or operations which are out of the ordinary, unexpected
or not readily apparent. Tags shall be used until a time as the identified
hazard is eliminated or the hazardous operation is completed. All required tags
shall meet the following criteria.
      (1)   Tags shall contain a signal word and a major message. The signal
word shall be "BIOHAZARD", or the biological hazard symbol. The major message
shall indicate the specific hazardous condition or the instruction to be
communicated to employees.
      (2)   The signal word shall be readable at a minimum distance of five
feet or a greater distance as warranted by the hazard.
      (3)   All employees shall be informed of the meaning of the various tags
used throughout the workplace and what special precautions are necessary.
   (M)   Linen soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials
shall be handled as little as possible and with minimum agitation to prevent
contamination of the person handling the line. All soiled linen shall be bagged
at the location where it was used. It shall not be sorted or rinsed in the
area. Soiled linen shall be placed and transported in bags that prevent
leakage. The employee responsible for transporting soiled linen should always
wear protective gloves to prevent possible contamination. After removing the
gloves, hands or other skin surfaces shall be washed thoroughly and immediately
after contact with potentially infectious materials; and
   (N)   Whenever possible, disposable equipment shall be used to minimize and
contain clean-up.
(1989 Code, § 4-506)
§ 4-507 HEPATITIS B VACCINATIONS.
   The city shall offer the appropriate hepatitis B vaccination to employees at
risk of exposure free of charge and in amounts at times prescribed by standard
medical practices. The vaccination shall be voluntarily administered. High risk
employees who wish to take the HBV vaccination should notify their department
heads who shall make the appropriate arrangements through the Infectious
Disease Control Coordinator.
(1989 Code, § 4-507)
§ 4-508 REPORTING POTENTIAL EXPOSURE.
   (A)   City employees shall observe the following procedures for reporting a
job exposure incident that may put them at risk for HIV or HBV infections
(i.e., needle sticks, blood contact on broken skin, body fluid contact with
eyes or mouth and the like):
      (1)   Notify the Infectious Disease Control Coordinator of the contact
incident and details thereof;
      (2)   Complete the appropriate accident reports and any other specific
forms required; and
      (3)   Arrangements will be made for the person to be seen by a physician
as with any job-related injury.
   (B)   Once an exposure has occurred, a blood sample should be drawn after
consent is obtained from the individual from whom exposure occurred and tested
for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibody to human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV antibody). Testing of the source individual should
be done at a location where appropriate pretest counseling is available. Post-
test counseling and referral for treatment should also be provided.
(1989 Code, § 4-508)
§ 4-509 HEPATITIS B VIRUS POST-EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   For an exposure to a source individual found to be positive for HBsAg,
the worker who has not previously been given the hepatitis B vaccine should
receive the vaccine series. A single dose of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG)
is also recommended, if it can be given within seven days of exposure.
   (B)   For exposure from an HBsAg-positive source to workers who have
previously received the vaccine, the exposed worker should be tested for
antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and given one dose of
vaccine and one dose of HBIG if the antibody level in the worker's blood sample
is inadequate (i.e., ten SRU by RIA, negative by EIA).
   (C)   If the source individual is negative for HBsAg and the worker has not
been vaccinated, this opportunity should be taken to provide the Hepatitis B
vaccine series. HBIG administration should be considered on an individual basis
when the source individual is known or suspected to be at high risk of HBV
infection. Management and treatment, if any, of previously vaccinated workers
who receive an exposure from a source who refuses testing or is not
identifiable should be individualized.
(1989 Code, § 4-509)
§ 4-510 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS POST-EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT.
   For any exposure to a source individual who has AIDS, who is found to be
positive for HIV infection, or who refuses testing, the worker should be
counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated clinically and
serologically for evidence of HIV infection as soon as possible after the
exposure. The worker should be advised to report and seek evaluation
immediately and receive appropriate prescribed medical therapy, including any
post exposure prophylaxis as recommended by the health care provider. Such an
illness, particularly one characterized by fever, rash or lymphadenopathy, may
be indicative of recent HIV infection.
(1989 Code, § 4-510)
§ 4-511 DISABILITY BENEFITS.
   Entitlement to disability benefits and any other benefits available for
employees who suffer from on the job injuries will be determined by the State
Worker's Compensations Bureau in accordance with the provisions of T.C.A. § 50-
6-303.
(1989 Code, § 4-511)
§ 4-512 TRAINING.
   (A)   Regular employees. On an annual basis, all employees shall receive
training and education on precautionary measures, epidemiology, modes of
transmission and prevention of HIV/HBV infection and procedures to be used if
they are exposed to needle sticks or potentially infectious material. They
shall also be counseled regarding possible risks to the fetus from HIV/HBV and
other associated infectious agents.
   (B)   High risk employees. In addition to the above, high risk employees
shall also receive training regarding the location and proper use of personal
protective equipment. They shall be trained concerning proper work practices
and understand the concept of "universal precautions" as it applies to their
work situations. They shall also be trained about the meaning of color coding
and other methods used to designate contaminated material. Where tags are used,
training shall cover precautions to be used in handling contaminated materials
as per this policy.
   (C)   New employees. During the new employee's orientation to his or her
job, all new employees will be trained on the effects of infectious disease
prior to putting them to work.
(1989 Code, § 4-512)
§ 4-513 RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   (A)   Reports. Occupational injury and illness records shall be maintained
by the infectious disease control coordinator. Statistics shall be maintained
on the OSHA-200 report. Only those work-related injuries that involve loss of
consciousness, transfer to another job, restriction of work or motion or
medical treatment are required to be put on the OSHA-200.
   (B)   Needle sticks. Needle sticks, like any other puncture wound, are
considered injuries for record- keeping purposes due to the instantaneous
nature of the event. Therefore, any needle stick requiring medical treatment
(i.e., gamma globulin, hepatitis B immune globulin, hepatitis B vaccine and the
like) shall be recorded.
   (C)   Prescription medication. Likewise, the use of prescription medication
(beyond a single dose for minor injury or discomfort) is considered medical
treatment. Since these types of treatment are considered necessary, and must be
administered by physician or licensed medical personnel, the injuries cannot be
considered minor and must be reported.
(1989 Code, § 4-513)
§ 4-514 LEGAL RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES.
   Victims of communicable diseases have the legal right to expect, and
municipal employees, including police and emergency service officers are duly
bound to provide, the same level of service and enforcement as any other
individual would receive.
   (A)   Officers assume that a certain degree of risk exists in law
enforcement and emergency service work and accept those risks with their
individual appointments. This holds true with any potential risks of contacting
a communicable disease as surely as it does with the risks of confronting an
armed criminal.
   (B)   Any officer who refuses to take proper action in regard to victims of
a communicable disease, when appropriate protective equipment is available,
shall be subject to disciplinary measures along with civil and/or criminal
prosecution.
   (C)   Whenever an officer mentions in a report that an individual has or may

CLERK'S OFFICE.
   The Finance Department and City Clerk's Department are service agencies for
all other departments of the city with respect to purchasing. The purchasing

(Ord. 1024, passed 5-7-2004; Ord. 1693, passed 3-14-2023)
§ 5-604 PURCHASES EXCEEDING $2,500.
   (A)   Purchase requisitions. All purchases exceeding $2,500 must be
initiated through the preparation and submittal of a purchase requisition to
the Finance Department. The purchase requisition serves to inform the Finance
Department of the needs of the using department and to correctly define the
material or service requested.
      (1)   When prepared. Requisitions shall be prepared after the department
obtains competitive prices and before vendor delivery.
      (2)   Who prepares the requisition. Requisitions shall originate in the
using department and be signed by the requisitioner and the department head.
The department head shall file with the Finance Department a certified
memorandum listing those who are authorized to sign a requisition.
      (3)   How to prepare. A properly processed purchase requisition must
contain the following information:
         (a)   Date issued - date the requisition is prepared;
         (b)   Date needed - state a definite delivery date. Prepare far enough
in advance to avoid emergencies;
         (c)   Department - complete name of using department;
         (d)   Account distribution - complete budgetary code;
         (e)   Vendor name and address. When applicable, attach three phone
quotes with vendor name, price, contact and supporting documentation;
         (f)   Item number - numerical order of items listed;
         (g)   Quantity - number required;
         (h)   Unit - dozen, lineal feet, gallons and the like;
         (i)   Description - give a clear description of the items desired as
to size, color, type and the like. If the purchase is of technical nature,
specifications should be attached to the requisition. If the item cannot be
described without a great amount of detail, a brief description should be given
followed by a trade name and model number of an acceptable item “or approved
equal”. Note: Incomplete information in this area will result in the
requisition being returned to the using department for clarification;
         (j)   Unit price - price for each individual item;
         (k)   Amount - total of quantity times unit price;
         (l)   Delivery instructions - Be specific. If vague or indefinite,
confusion may result in costly delays;
         (m)   Requisitioner - signature of the person initiating the purchase
request; and
         (n)   Department head - signature of the department head.
      (4)   Routing of requisitions. Prepare three copies of the purchase
requisition. Send the original and one copy to the Finance Department and
retain the third copy in department files. The Finance Officer shall certify by
signature that the proper account has been charged and the availability of
budgetary and cash funds. The original requisition shall then be returned to
the Finance Department and the copy filed in the office of the Finance
Director.
      (5)   General information. A requisition must be completed before a
purchase is made, except as otherwise provided herein. Approximate cost of
items will enable finance to determine if bids are required. If a requisition
is incomplete or improperly prepared, the Finance Department shall return it to
the using department for completion. An incomplete requisition could cause
unnecessary delays. The requisitioner shall not split orders to circumvent any
provision of the city code or charter, this manual or any policy established by
the city, nor shall requisitions be submitted for the sole purpose of using up
budgetary balances.
      (6)   Expediting orders. If a company is awaiting a purchase order to
process a rush order, the words “EXPEDITE IMMEDIATELY” must be placed in the
body of the requisition. The Finance Department will then contact the vendor
and supply a purchase order number. This process will be the exception rather
than the rule.
      (7)   Insufficient funds. If it is determined by the Finance Director
that the account lacks a sufficient budget, it will be referred to the City
Manager, who will notify the department head.
   (B)   Purchase orders. Following the approval of a purchase requisition, a
purchase order is prepared by the Finance Department to authorize the seller to
ship and invoice the materials and services as specified. Purchase orders shall
be written so that they are clear, concise and complete. This prevents
misunderstandings and unnecessary correspondence with suppliers.
      (1)   When prepared. Purchase orders are issued only after an acceptable
requisition has been submitted and after approval of the City Manager and the
Finance Officer. No purchase order will be issued until the Finance Officer has
certified adequate budgetary and cash balances to make the purchase, except as
otherwise provided herein
      (2)   Who issues the purchase order. Only the Finance Department shall
issue purchase orders.
      (3)   Cancellations. The Finance Department must initiate all
cancellations and will issue a purchase order to the next best vendor or renew
the purchasing process.

§ 5-605 PURCHASES OF $2,500 OR LESS.
   (A)   Purchases of $2,500 or less can be made without the use of a purchase
requisition; however, a purchase order issued through the Finance Department is
required.
   (B)   The department head, or authorized purchaser, may obtain a purchase
order from the Finance Department. It is the responsibility of the department
head, considering price and quality, to determine the best source of supply.
All local sources should be considered before a purchase is made. Under no
circumstances may multiple forms be used, if the purchase is over the dollar
limit, in an effort to avoid filling out a purchase requisition.
   (C)   The following information must be provided by the ordering department
prior to the issuance of a purchase order:
      (1)   Vendor - firm or person from whom purchase is being made;
      (2)   Vendor’s address - address of vendor;

submitting a requisition in the regular manner, or where property, equipment or
life are endangered through unexpected circumstances and materials, services
and the like are needed immediately.
   (B)   By whom made. Emergency purchases, either verbal or written, may be
made directly by the using department without competitive bids; provided,
sufficient appropriation has been made to cover the occasions and necessary
approvals have been secured.
   (C)   Who authorizes. The City Manager or department supervisors designated
in writing and approved by the City Manager may authorize an emergency
purchase.
   (D)   How to make. After determining that a true emergency exists, the
following procedure should be used:
      (1)   Notify the Finance Department of the need and nature of the
emergency. The Finance Department will give verbal approval and issue a
purchase order number. This number will be referenced on the requisition;
      (2)   Using department shall at all times use sound judgment in making
emergency purchases of materials and supplies and for labor or equipment at the
best possible price. Orders should be placed with vendors with whom the using
department has had previous satisfactory experience;
      (3)   Suppliers shall furnish sales tickets, delivery slips, invoices and
the like for the supplies or services rendered. Terms of the transactions,
indicating price and other data, shall be shown;
      (4)   Upon completion of the purchase, on the same or following business
day, the using department shall perform the following:
         (a)   Present to the Finance Department a completed requisition
stating a description of the emergency and approval by the department head. The
words "CONFIRMING EMERGENCY PURCHASE" shall be marked plainly on the
requisition, along with the purchase order number used;
         (b)   The sales ticket, delivery slips, invoices and material
receiving report confirming the purchase must be attached to the emergency
requisition form; and
         (c)   The Finance Department will issue a purchase order marked
“CONFIRMATION”.
      (5)   If an emergency should occur during a time when the Finance
Department normally is closed, the using department will follow the above
procedure with the exception of division (D)(1) above. The evidence of
purchase, such as sales slip, counter receipt, delivery slip, invoice and the
like, which the supplier normally furnishes, shall be attached to the completed
and approved requisition form and be forwarded to the Finance Department, along
with a material receiving report; and
      (6)   The person authorizing the emergency purchase shall prepare a
report to the City Manager and the City Council, as soon as possible,
specifying the amount paid, the item(s) purchased, from whom the purchase(s)
was made, and the nature of the emergency. NOTE: Emergency purchases are costly
and should be kept to a minimum. Avoiding emergency orders will ultimately save
the city money.

§ 5-608 PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS.
   (A)   Any public work or improvement, costing more than $1,000 shall be
executed by contract, except when a specific work or improvement is authorized
by the City Council and approved by the City Manager.
   (B)   All contracts for more than the bid threshold shall be awarded to the
lowest responsible bidder, after publication, advertisement and competition;
but no contract for any public work or improvement shall be awarded, except on
condition that the contractor gives bond with some bonding company authorized
to transact business in the state as surety, in a sum equal to at least 50% of
the contract price of the particular work or improvement for the faithful
performance of the contract.
   (C)   The City Manager shall have the power to reject all of the bids and to
perform the work with city resources and all advertisements shall contain a
reservation of this right.
   (D)   Sealed bids or proposals. Sealed bids are required on purchases over
the bid threshold or more. Advertisement of bids in a local newspaper of
general circulation must be not less than five days before bid opening date.
      (1)   City clerk’s office responsibility.
         (a)   Prepare bid requests;
         (b)   Establish date and time for bid opening;
         (c)   Mail or e-mail bid requests and advertise as appropriate. If
hand delivered, an appropriate receipt of the bid request should be signed by
the vendor;
         (d)   Receive and open bids;
         (e)   Tabulate bids and distribute to using department for their
evaluation and recommendation; and
         (f)   Maintain all specification and bid data files.
      (2)   Using department’s responsibility.
         (a)   Prepare specifications to initiate bid process. This should
contain specific information about items needed (i.e., quantity, size, brand
preferred, performance requirements, suggested vendors and the like);
         (b)   Submit requisition to initiate bid process to the City Clerk’s
office at least three weeks prior to the date the bids are to be opened;
         (c)   After bids are opened and tabulated, evaluate bid results and
make recommendation on award to City Council for approval; and
         (d)   Contact Finance Department to initiate preparation of purchase
order after City Council approval.
      (3)   Sealed bid policies. The following policies shall apply to sealed
bids.
         (a)   Bid or proposal opening. Bids will be opened at the time and
date specified on the bid request. All bids are opened publicly and read aloud,
with a tabulation provided to all vendors participating. Hand delivered,
mailed, or electronic submissions may be accepted in the form of a sealed bid.
Faxed bids will not be accepted when a sealed bid is required.
         (b)   Electronic bids. Electronic bids may be received by e-mail to
the e-mail specified within the bid documents. Bids received electronically
after the bid opening date and time or sent to the incorrect e-mail will not be
viewed or considered.
         (c)   Bid opening schedule. The City Clerk’s office is responsible for
setting bid opening dates and times.
         (d)   Telephone bids. The city will not accept any bid by telephone.
         (e)   Bid form. The City Clerk’s office will send one copy of the bid
request form to each bidder. Bids will not be accepted on any vendor
letterhead, vendor bid form or other substitutions unless special permission is
granted by the City Clerk’s office.
         (f)   Unsigned bids. Failure of a vendor representative to sign a bid
proposal removes that bid from consideration. A typed official’s name will not
be acceptable without that person’s written signature.
         (g)   Acceptance of bids. The city reserves the right to reject any or
all bids, to waive any irregularities in a bid, to make awards to more than one
bidder, to accept any part or all of a bid, or to accept that bid (or bids)
which in the judgment of the City Council is in the best interest of the city.
         (h)   Shipping charges. Bids are to include all shipping charges to
the point of delivery. Bids will only be considered on the basis of delivered
price, except as otherwise authorized by the City Council.
         (i)   Sample product policy. The city may request a sample product as
part of a bid. If this is stated on the bid proposal form, the vendor is
required to comply with this request or have the bid removed from
consideration.
         (j)   Approved equal policy. Specifications furnished in the request
for bid are intended to establish a desired quality or performance level or
other minimum requirements which will provide the city with the best product
available at the lowest possible price. When a brand name and/or model is
designated, it signifies the minimum quality acceptable. If an alternate is
offered, the bidder must include the brand name or model to be furnished, along
with complete specifications and descriptive literature, and, if requested, a
sample for testing. Other than designated and/or models approved as “equal to”
designated products shall receive equal consideration.
         (k)   Alternate bids. Should it be found, after bids have been opened,
that a product has been offered with an alternate specification and that this
product would prove to be satisfactory and more economical for the city to use,
all bids for that item may be rejected and specifications re-drawn to allow all
bidders an equal opportunity to submit bids on the alternate item.
         (l)   Vendor identification. Potential suppliers are selected from
existing vendor files, using department’s suggestions, and any and all sources
available to locate vendors related to a specific product or service. New
suppliers are added to the bid list as they are identified.
         (m)   Tie bids. A tie bid is one in which two or more vendors bid
identical items at the same unit cost. Tie bids may be determined by one of the
following factors:
            1.   Discount allowed;
            2.   Delivery schedule;
            3.   Previous vendor performance;
            4.   Vendor location; and
            5.   Trade-in value offered.
         (n)   Cancellation of invitation for bid or request for proposal. An
invitation for bid, a request for proposal, or other solicitations may be
cancelled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in part as may be
specified in the solicitation when it is in the best interest of the city. The
reasons therefore shall be a made of a part of the bid or proposal file.
         (o)   Public advertisement. In addition to publication in a newspaper
of general circulation as required by law, the City Manager may make any other
efforts deemed appropriate to notify all prospective bidders of the invitation
to bid. This may be accomplished by delivery, verbally, by mail or by posting
the invitation to bid in a public place. It is not required that specifications
be included in the invitation to bid; however, this notice should state clearly
the purchase that is to be made.
         (p)   Sealed bids and sealed proposals. “Although the formal sealed
bid process should remain a standard in public purchasing, there is a place for
competitive negotiation. (State and Local Government Purchasing, The Council of
State Governments (1975) at 2.2). “Competitive sealed bidding, as defined in
this code, is the preferred method of procurement. The competitive sealed
proposal method (similar to competitive negotiation) is available for use when
competitive sealed bidding is not practicable. Both methods utilize price and
product competition, but to different degrees and in different manners. The use
of functional or performance specification is allowed under both methods to
facilitate consideration of alternative means of meeting (state) needs, with
evaluation, where appropriate, on the basis of total or life cycle costs. The
methodology and the ranking or relative importance of the criteria to be used
in the evaluation process under either method must be fully disclosed in the
solicitation. Only criteria disclosed in the solicitation may be used to
evaluate the items bid or proposed. The two methods of source selection differ
in the following ways.
            1.   Under competitive sealed bidding, subjective factors may be
issued only to determine if the supply, service or construction item bid meets
the purchase description. Under competitive sealed proposals, subjective
factors may be used to determine not only if the items being offered meet the
purchase description, but may also be used to evaluate competing proposals. The
effect of this different use of subjective evaluation is that under competitive
sealed bidding, once the subjective evaluation is completed, award is made on a
purely objective basis to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Under
competitive sealed proposals, the quality of competing products may be compared
and trade-offs made between price and quality of the items offered (all as set
forth in the solicitation). Award under competitive sealed proposals is then
made to the responsible offer or whose proposal is most advantageous to the
city.
            2.   Competitive sealed bidding and competitive sealed proposals
also differ in that, under competitive sealed bidding, no change in bids is
allowed once they have been opened, except for correction of errors in limited
circumstances. The competitive sealed proposal method, on the other hand,
permits discussions after proposals have been opened to allow clarification and
changes in proposals provided that adequate precautions are taken to treat each
offer fairly and to ensure that information gleaned from competing proposals is
not disclosed to other offerors. (Source: A Model Procurement Code for State
and Local Governments -- Coordinating Committee’s Tentative Draft. American Bar
Association, July 1978. Pages 54 and 55.)
      (4)   Other aspects to be considered in bid awards. In addition to price,
the following aspects also will be considered in the award of a bid:
         (a)   The ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the
material or service required;
         (b)   Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the
material or service promptly or within the time specified, without delay or
interference;
         (c)   The character, integrity, reputation, experience and efficiency
of the bidder;
         (d)   The previous and existing compliance, by the bidder, with laws
and ordinances relating to the contract or service;
         (e)   The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service for the use of the subject contract;
         (f)   Terms and conditions stated in bid; and
         (g)   Compliance with specifications or request for proposal.
      (5)   Non-performance policy. Failure of a bidder to complete a contract,
bid or purchase order in the specified time agreed upon, or failure to provide
the service, materials or supplies required by the contract, bid or purchase
order, or failure to honor a quoted price on services, materials or supplies on
a contract, bid or purchase order may result in one or more of the following
actions:
         (a)   Removal of a vendor from bid list for a period to be determined
by the City Council;
         (b)   Allowing the vendor to find the needed item for the city from
another supplier at no additional cost to the city;
         (c)   Allowing the city to purchase the needed service, materials or
supplies from another source and charge the vendor for any difference in cost
resulting from this purchase; and
         (d)   Allowing monetary settlement.
      (6)   Request for bid. The request for bid form shall be used when deemed
necessary by the City Manager.
      (7)   Summary of bids. The summary of bids form shall be issued by the
City Clerk’s office to record quotations.
(Ord. 1024, passed 5-7-2004; Ord. 1693, passed 3-14-2023; Ord. 1733, passed 5-
13-2025)
§ 5-609 GENERAL PROCEDURES AND RULES.
   All competitive bids or quotations received shall be recorded and maintained
in the office of the City Manager for a minimum of two years after audit. When
requisitions are required, the competitive bids or quotations received shall be
listed upon that document prior to the issuance of the purchase order.
   (A)   Preference to local dealers. In the purchasing of supplies, materials,
equipment and services for the city's requirements, preference shall be given
those dealers having stores or warehouses within the city; price, quality,
delivery and service being equal.
   (B)   Federal excise tax. The city is exempt from the payment of excise
taxes imposed by the federal government, and suppliers should be requested to
deduct the amount of the taxes from their bids, quotations and invoices.
   (C)   Standardization requirements. Important economies can be effected
through standardizing supplies and materials that can be purchased in large
amounts. Thus, department heads should adopt as standards the minimum number of
quantities, sizes and varieties of commodities consistent with successful
operation. Where practical, materials and supplies should be purchased on the
basis of requirements for a six-month period.
   (D)   Inspection of deliveries. No invoices for supplies, materials or
equipment shall be accepted for payment until the supplies, materials and the
like have been received and inspected by the department head.
   (E)   Correspondence with suppliers. Copies of any correspondence with
suppliers concerning prices, adjustments and defective merchandise shall be
forwarded to the Finance Department. All invoices, bills of lading, delivery
tickets and other papers pertaining to purchases shall be sent to the Finance
Department.
   (F)   Claims. The City Manager shall prosecute all claims for shortages,
breakages or other complaints against either shipper or carrier in connection
with shipments.
   (G)   Public inspection of records. The City Clerk's office and Finance
Department shall keep a complete record of all quotations, bids and purchase
orders. The records shall be open to public inspection.
   (H)   Prohibition of contracts with municipal officers. State laws governing
doing business with officers of the city are:
      (1)   T.C.A. § 6-54-107, Interest of officer in municipal contracts
prohibited.
         (a)   No person holding office under any municipal corporation shall,
during the time for which he or she was elected or appointed, be capable of
contracting with the corporation for the performance of any work which is to be
paid for out of the treasury. Nor shall the person be capable of holding or
having any other direct interest in a contract. DIRECT INTEREST means any
contract with any business in which the official is the sole proprietor, a
partner, or the person having the controlling interest. CONTROLLING INTEREST
shall include the individual with the ownership or control of the largest
number of outstanding shares owned by any single individual or corporation.
         (b)   No officer in a municipality shall be indirectly interested in
any contract to which the municipality is a party unless the officer publicly
acknowledges his or her interest and excuses himself or herself from any of his
or her duties which include the consideration of, voting on or overseeing the
particular contract. INDIRECTLY INTERESTED means any contract in which the
officer is interested but not directly so, but includes contracts where the
officer is directly interested, but is the sole supplier of goods or services
in a municipality.
      (2)   T.C.A. § 12-4-101, Personal interest of officers prohibited.
         (a)   It shall not be lawful for any officer, committee member,
director or other person whose duty it is to vote for, let out, overlook or in
any manner to superintend any work or any contract in which any municipal
corporation, county, state, development districts, utility districts, human
resource agencies and other political subdivisions created by statute shall or
may be interested, to be directly interested in any contract. DIRECTLY
INTERESTED means any contract with the official himself or herself or with any
business in which the official is the sole proprietor, a partner or the person
having the controlling interest. CONTROLLING INTEREST shall include the
individual with the ownership or control of the largest number of outstanding
shares owned by any single individual or corporation.
         (b)   It shall not be lawful for any officer, committee member,
director or other person whose duty it is to vote for, let out, overlook or in
any manner to superintend any work or any contract in which any municipal
corporation, county, state, development districts, utility districts, human
resource agencies and other political subdivisions created by statute shall or
may be interested, to be indirectly interested in any such contract unless the
officer publicly acknowledges his or her interest. INDIRECTLY INTERESTED means
any contract in which the officer is interested, but not directly so, but
includes contracts where the officer is directly interested, but is the sole
supplier of goods or services in a municipality or county.
   (I)   Designee. When a position such as City Manager, Finance Director, City
Clerk or department head is mentioned herein, their assistants or designees are
included as if they also were written thereafter; provided that, persons
holding these positions have designated others to carry out the duties.

any public works project or improvement must be prepared by a registered
architect or engineer as required by T.C.A. § 62-2-107.
      CONTRACTUAL PURCHASES. The materials, supplies or services which are
constantly needed for city operations will be taken on a formal bid and will be
awarded by the City Council for a contract period determined to be in the best
interest of the city. These purchases supersede bidding requirements, but not
budgetary restraints, even if the purchases total over the bid threshold at one
or several times throughout the year.
      CUSTOMARILY PURCHASED. That which is regularly purchased under specific
circumstances which would be considered reasonable and appropriate. (Example:
After two consecutive years; then, not required after two consecutive years of
not attaining the total amount of $2,500.)
      DELINQUENT DELIVERY. Once the Finance Department has issued a purchase
order, no follow-up work is done unless the using department advises the item
has not been received. Upon this notification, the Finance Department will
initiate action, either written or verbal as time allows, to investigate the
delay. The using department will be advised of any further problems or a
revised delivery date.
      INSPECTION AND TESTING. When deemed necessary, the City Manager may cause
to be inspected all deliveries of supplies, materials, equipment or contractual
services to determine their performance with the specification set forth in an
order or contract. The City Manager may require chemical and physical tests of
materials submitted with bids and delivery samples, or after products have been
delivered, to determine their quality in conformance with specifications. In
the performance of the tests, the City Manager may make use of laboratory
facilities of any outside laboratory.
      ITEMS COVERED BY WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE. The city acquires many items
which have a warranty or guarantee for a certain length of time, such as tires,

Manager in writing of any equipment or materials. The City Manager will
determine the best method of disposal of those items with an estimated value of
less than $5,000 and instruct the department head as to the disposal method.
Following approval by the City Council, items with an estimated value of $5,000
or more shall be disposed of by one of the following methods:
            1.   As a trade-in on the purchase of new equipment;
            2.   Advertised and bids received by the rCity Manager;
            3.   Transferred from one department to another; or

or policy. If the item being purchased is over the threshold for which the City
Manager may approve a purchase but has been approved within that fiscal year's
budget by City Council, the item may be purchased with the City Manager's
approval and not be voted on by City Council.

whether he, she, himself or herself, signed or prepared the application or
whether the same is prepared by another; of if the interest is acquired after
the issuance of the license, the burden of the disclosure of the acquisition of
the interest shall be upon the seller and the purchaser.

licensee, but is a privilege subject to revocation or suspension under this
chapter.

permit has expired. The Director of Law or persons designated by him or her so
to do, may conduct any investigations into any applicant for a solicitations
permit or as to any holder of a solicitations permit when it appears to the
Director or in response to complaints made known to the Director that any of
the provisions of this chapter are being violated or the applicant or holder of

its discretion, may grant a permit where 50% of all monies collected go to the

expenses to gross revenues herein set forth shall be waived by the Board where
special facts and circumstances are presented showing that a higher cost is not

(1989 Code, § 9-312)
§ 9-312 REVOCATION AND SUSPENSION OF PERMITS—HEARING; DECISION.
   Whenever it shall be shown, or whenever the Board has knowledge, that any
person to whom a permit has been issued under this chapter has violated any of
the provisions of this chapter, or that any promoter, agent, professional
solicitor or solicitor of a permit holder has misrepresented the purpose of the
solicitation, the Board shall immediately suspend the permit and give the
permit holder written notice by registered, special delivery, mail of a hearing
to be held within two days of the suspension to determine whether or not the
permit should be revoked. This notice must contain a statement of the facts
upon which the Board has acted in suspending the permit. At the hearing, the
permit holder, and any other interested person, may have the right to present
evidence as to the facts upon which the Board based the suspension of the
permit, and any other facts which may aid the Board in determining whether this
chapter has been violated and whether the purpose of the solicitation has been
misrepresented. If, after the hearing, the Board finds that this chapter has
been violated, where the purpose of the solicitation has been misrepresented,
it shall within two days after the hearing file in the Clerk's office for
public inspection and serve upon the permit holder and all interested persons
who participated in the hearing, a written statement of the facts from which it
based the finding and immediately revoke the permit. If, after the hearing, the
Board finds that this chapter has not been violated and the purpose of the
solicitation has not been misrepresented, it shall within two days after the
hearing, give to the permit holder a written statement cancelling the
suspension of the permit and stating that no violation or misrepresentation was
found to have been committed.

detailed report of wages, fees, commissions and expenses paid to any person in
connection with the solicitation, and the disposition of the balance of the
funds collected by the solicitation. This report shall be available for public
inspection in the Clerk's office at any reasonable time; provided, however,
that, the Board may extend the time for the filing of the report required by
this section for an additional period of 30 days upon proof that filing of the
report within the specified time will work unnecessary hardship on the permit
holder. Additional extensions of time may be granted by the Board, but only
after they have been approved by the majority vote of the Board. The permit
holder shall make available to the Board, or to any person designated in
writing by the Board as its representative for such a purpose, all books,
records and papers whereby the accuracy of the report required by this section
may be checked. The Board shall to the extent possible adopt uniform reporting

§ 9-610 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person
aggrieved") may file a complaint with the City Manager. Complaints shall be in
writing and shall contain the information and be in a form as the City Manager
requires. Upon receipt of a complaint, the City Manager shall furnish a copy of
the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or is about to commit
the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a
complaint, or within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference
under division (C) below, the City Manager shall investigate the complaint and
give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to
resolve it. If the City Manager decides to resolve the complaints, he or she
shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing
practice by information methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion.
Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made
public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter
without the written consent of the persons concerned. Any employee of the City
Manager who shall make public any information in violation of this provision
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file and answer to the complaint
against him or her and with the leave of the City Manager, which shall be
granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his or her
answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the City Manager,
the City Manager has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this
chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days thereafter, file a complaint
with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The City
Manager will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the City Manager has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance
within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as the rights relate to the subject of the complaint.
If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in the
practice or order the affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complaint.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
City Manager shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary
compliance.
(1989 Code, § 9-610)
§ 9-611 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS; GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the City Manager shall have access at
all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy the
materials and take and record the testimony or statements of the persons as are
reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation; provided,
however, that, the City Manager first complies with the provisions of the
Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The City
Manager may issue subpoenas to compel his or her access to or the production of
the materials, or the appearance of the persons, and may issue interrogatories
to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of
a civil action in the United States District Court of the district in which the
investigation is taking place. The City Manager may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the City Manager, a respondent shall be
entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name
of the City Manager to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
subpoenas issued by the City Manager himself or herself. Subpoenas issued at
the request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and address of
the respondent and shall state that they were issued at his or her request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the City Manager shall be entitled
to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United
States District Courts. Fees payable to the witness summoned by a subpoena
issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the City Manager to revoke or modify the subpoena. The City
Manager shall grant the petition if he or she finds that the subpoena requires
appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires
production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation,
that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be
produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the City Manager
or other person at whose request it was issued, may petition for its
enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the
person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts
business.
   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence,
if in his or her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order
of the City Manager shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more
than one year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the City
Manager, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in
any report, account, record or other document submitted the City Manager
pursuant to his or her subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or
fail to make or cause to be made full, true and correct entries in the reports,
accounts, records or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter or by
any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be fined not more than
$1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.
   (G)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the City
Manager participates as party or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.

alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that, the
court shall continue the civil case brought to this section or §
9-610(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial or renting dwellings;
   (B)   Any person because he or she is or has been, or in order to intimidate
the person or any other person or any class of persons from:

religion or national origin, in any of the activities, services, organizations
or facilities, or participating lawfully in speech or peaceful assembly
opposing any denial of the opportunity to so participate shall be fined not
more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and, if bodily
injury results, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more

Editor's note:
   This chapter was amended during the February 12, 2008, "Change 1".
§ 9-901 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent, nor effect, of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of
Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes V. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to,
Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the
Report of the Attorney Generals Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually
Oriented Businesses, (6-6-1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises;
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments;
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows;
      (4)   Offering and providing the space encourages these activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions;
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of the sexually oriented businesses;
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections;
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States — 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983;
4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985; and 253,448 through 12-31-1992;
      (8)   As of 2-28-1994, there have been 3,755 reported cases of AIDS in
the state;
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Cumberland County;
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990;
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990;
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his or her report of
10-22-1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn;
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities;
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films;
      (16)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (15) above raise
substantial governmental concerns;
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore non-existent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein;
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters;
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in the establishments;
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where the information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of the uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases;
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to the activity;
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter;
      (24)   The barring of the individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; and
      (25)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

§ 9-1301 FINDINGS.
   The City Council makes the following findings:
   (A)   T.C.A. § 39-17-438 pertaining to substances generally known as
"synthetic marijuana" and T.C.A. § 39-17-452 pertaining to substances generally
known as "bath salts" govern certain actions regarding the substances listed in
those statutes and certain synthetic derivatives or analogues of compounds
listed therein, but the board has been informed that the chemical makeup of
these synthetic drugs is or can be changed to avoid using the listed
substances, while providing the same effect and detrimental health risk, making
enforcement of such statutes difficult and ineffective.
   (B)   Synthetic marijuana and "bath salts" are being manufactured in a way
to avoid the application of existing state and federal laws.
   (C)   Studies have indicated that synthetic marijuana usage includes the
dangers associated with using natural marijuana, with additional danger to the
public health due, in part, to the unknown nature of any long term effects of
this synthetically created substance.
   (D)   The Council finds that synthetic marijuana (synthetic cannabinoids) or
compounds that emulate or simulate the effects of synthetic cannabinoids
through chemical changes such as the addition, subtraction or rearranging of a
radical or the addition, subtraction or rearranging of a substituent have been
developed such that it can create similar hallucinogenic qualities to natural
marijuana and such items are now being possessed, distributed, and sold in the
city.
   (E)   The Council finds a manufactured product known as "bath salts", "plant
food", "fake bath salts", "fake fertilizer", and/or "fake insect repellant" has
been developed, and that compounds that emulate or simulate the effects of such
synthetic derivatives or analogues of cathinone or methcathinone or the
derivatives or analogues of the chemicals or compounds listed in T.C.A. § 39-
17-452 through chemical changes such as the addition, subtraction or
rearranging of a radical or the addition, subtraction or rearranging of a
substituent have been developed and are now being possessed, distributed, and
sold in the city and the usage of these compounds have effects similar to
methamphetamine.
   (F)   The 2011 edition of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration's "Drugs
of Abuse: A DEA Resource Guide," designates bath salts as a drug of concern
which poses risks to users.
   (G)   The use of these types of compounds can be extremely addictive, and
are not currently detectable by drug testing procedures commonly used in the
workplace.
   (H)   The use of synthetic marijuana or "bath salts", even with the change
in chemical compounds, creates a danger to the health and safety of the public,
and to protect the health and welfare of the public it is necessary to prohibit
the use, sale, possession and distribution of said compounds, not otherwise
controlled by state or federal law.
   (I)   Pursuant to the Crossville City Charter the city has the authority to
license and regulate all persons, firms, corporations, companies and
associations engaged in any business, occupation, calling, profession or trade
not prohibited by law; to define and prohibit, abate, suppress, prevent and
regulate all acts, practices, conduct, business, auctions, occupations,
callings, trades, uses of property and all other things whatsoever detrimental
or liable to be detrimental to the health, morals, comfort, safety, convenience
or welfare of the inhabitants of the city and to exercise general police
powers; to prescribe limits within which business occupations and practices
liable to be nuisances or detrimental to the health, morals, security or
general welfare of people may lawfully be established, conducted or maintained.
   (J)   The use, possession, production, manufacture, distribution,
transporting, selling, offer for sale, trading, bartering, exchanging or
purchase of the substances addressed herein is detrimental to the health,
safety, or welfare of the inhabitants of the city, and absent action by board
such activity is currently lawful in the city, and to protect the health,
safety or welfare of the inhabitants of the city such activity should be made
unlawful.
(Ord. 1341, passed 2-7-2012)

(1989 Code, § 10-206) (Ord. 1499, passed 1-18-2016)
§ 10-202.1 HUMANE RESTRAINT, SHELTER, AND MINIMUM ENCLOSURE GUIDELINES.
   (A)   In order to enhance the quality of life of citizens and dogs and to
protect the general public from damage and nuisance that may be caused by dogs
confined outdoors:
      (1)   No person shall tether, fasten, chain, tie, or restrain a dog, or
cause a dog to be tethered, fastened, chained, tied, or restrained, to a dog
house, tree, fence, or any other stationary object other than a spiral tie-out
stake or permanently affixed anchor which allows 360 degrees of movement.
Notwithstanding, a person may attach a dog to a running line, pully, or trolley
system. Any pully or trolley system must be at least 15 feet in length and at
least four feet and no more than seven feet off the ground.
      (2)   The tether must allow the dog to easily stand, sit, lie, turn
around, and make all other normal body movements in a comfortable normal
position. Vinyl coated cable is the preferred and recommended material for
tethering. (However, if a chain is used, no chain or tether shall weigh more
than 1/8 of the animal's body weight and be appropriate for the size of the
dog. Welded metal link chain with links larger than 7/64 inches in thickness
cannot be used to tether an animal regardless of the length or weight of the
chain.)
      (3)   Any tether shall be at least 12 feet in length and have swivels on
both ends.
      (4)   Any tether must be attached to a properly fitting buckle-type
collar or harness worn by the animal. Choke collars and pinch collars are
prohibited for purposes of tethering an animal to a spiral tie-out stake,
pulley system or cable run. A person may not wrap tether around an animal's
neck.
      (5)   A tether used to restrain an animal must, by design and placement,
be unlikely to become entangled with other objects or animals or from extending
over an object or edge that could result in the strangulation or injury of the
dog.
      (6)   It shall be unlawful to tether any un-sterilized female dog during
their 24-day period of fertility per T.C.A. § 44-8-410.
      (7)   The dog cannot be tethered (or confined to an outdoor enclosure)
during extreme weather, including, but not limited to, extreme heat or near-
freezing temperatures, dangerous thunderstorms, unless adequate food, potable
water, shade, shelter and protection is provided as outlined in this section.
Animals must have access to enter a dwelling during severe weather alerts from
the National Weather Service (i.e., tornado watches, floods, etc.).
      (8)   The animal, while restrained by a tether (or confined to an outdoor
enclosure) shall have access to tip-proof potable (sanitary and liquid) water
at all times, sufficient food and dry ground.
      (9)   A dog may never be left tethered (or confined in an outdoor
enclosure) and unattended on vacant or abandoned property.
      (10)   A dog that has been declared dangerous cannot be tethered. A dog
that is demonstrably aggressive cannot be tethered unless a competent adult is
present for the duration of the tethering.
      (11)   The following dogs may not be tethered: sick or injured, pregnant,
a female nursing pups, a dog less than six months of age.
      (12)   The animal (tethered or confined to an outdoor enclosure) must be
kept in a clean, sanitary and healthy manner and not confined so as to be
forced to stand, sit or lie in its own excrement. The animal must be able to
defecate and urinate in an area separate from the area where it must eat, drink
and lie down. The person(s) responsible for animal(s) shall regularly and as
often as necessary to prevent odor or health and sanitation problems, maintain
all animal areas or areas of animal contact and keep them free of sharp
objects, trash, or debris.
      (13)   Shade, separate from the shelter, either natural or manmade, shall
be available at all times to a tethered dog, or a dog confined to an outdoor
enclosure.
      (14)   The animal, while restrained by tether or in an outdoor enclosure,
shall have access to proper shelter at all times.
      (15)   Proper shelter shall have a weatherproof roof, enclosed sides, a
doorway, a solid floor raised at least two inches above the ground. No interior
surfaces shall be metal. The shelter shall have an entryway that the dog can
easily enter and sufficient in size for a dog to stand, turn around, lie down,
and exit in a natural manner. The shelter shall have adequate ventilation and
protection from temperature extremes at all times. The shelter shall be small
enough to retain the animal's body heat and large enough to allow the animal to
stand up and turn around comfortably. The enclosure shall be structurally sound
and in good repair. Bedding, such as wood shavings, straw or other material,
shall be provided in sufficient quantity for insulation. Bedding shall be kept
dry.
      (16)   Any dog confined within a permanent outdoor enclosure must have
adequate space for exercise. A minimum of 100 square feet is required. Dogs
over 75 pounds must have an additional 50 square feet. Seventy-five square feet
is required for each additional dog kept within the same enclosed area. This
requirement shall not apply to portable, temporary kennels.
      (17)   Any dog tethered or confined must be provided reasonable necessary
medica care to prevent suffering, in addition to the required rabies.
   (B)   Exceptions. Hunting dogs as defined below:
      (1)   Of hunting dogs. As used in this section, the term HUNTING DOG
means a dog actually used to lawfully hunt game in Tennessee or another state
of the United States under a valid hunting license issued by the state where
the hunting occurred during the present year or the year previous, and with
respect to a dog of less than 18 months of age a dog that has had training
toward hunting lawful game in Tennessee or another state of the United States.
The owner of the dog relying on the dog's status as a "hunting dog" under this
section may establish a prima facie case of such status by providing to a law
enforcement officer with a sworn written statement setting forth the specific
facts establishing that the dog is a "hunting dog" within the meaning of this
section. This exception shall not apply to unsterilized female dogs as noted in
division (A)(6).
      (2)   Of working dogs. As used in this section, the term WORKING DOG
means a dog that functions in a herding, service, therapy, or K-9 capacity and
is only exempt when working in those capacities.

persons.

has bitten or is suspected of having bitten any person or any other animal
within a period of ten days after the alleged incident. When any dog or other
animal has bitten or is suspected of having bitten any person or any other
animal within the corporate limits, the dog or other animal, when identified,
shall be impounded and quarantined at the shelter by the Animal Control Officer
or his or her assistant; or upon the request of the owner of the dog or other
animal, it shall be impounded under the jurisdiction and observation of a
licensed veterinarian for a reasonable time to determine whether the dog or
other animal has rabies. Any expenses incurred for the impounding or
veterinarian services shall be paid by the owner of the animal impounded.
(1989 Code, § 10-209)
§ 10-206 SEIZURE AND DISPOSITION OF DOGS AND OTHER DOMESTIC ANIMALS.
   (A)   Any domestic animal found running at large may be seized by the Animal
Control Officer or any police officer and placed in a shelter provided by the
City Council. If the animal is wearing a tag, the owner shall be notified in
person, by telephone or by a postcard addressed to his or her last known
mailing address to appear within ten days and redeem his or her animal by
paying a shelter fee, or the animal will be humanely destroyed or offered for
adoption. If the animal is not wearing a tag, it shall be humanely destroyed or
sold unless legally claimed by the owner within ten days. No animal shall be
released in any event from the shelter unless or until the animal has been
properly vaccinated and a tag placed on its collar.
   (B)   When, because of its viciousness or apparent infection with rabies, an
animal found running at large cannot be safely impounded, it may be summarily
destroyed by the Animal Control Officer or any police officer.

§ 11-801 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   The City Council does hereby find that:

supporting the fact that passive smoke increases the non-smokers' risk of
developing diseases related to cigarette smoke;
   (B)   The New Jersey Supreme Court held in 1986 that it is the employer's
responsibility to provide a healthy environment and the non-smoker has the
right to work in a healthy environment; and
   (C)   Statistics suggest that cities spend about $4,600 more a year to keep
a smoker on the payroll than a non-smoker. This estimate includes lost
productivity; damages from cigarette burns; accidents resulting from loss of
attention, eye irritation or coughing; lost time due to increased chances of
illness and early death; medical care; absenteeism; and increased fire
insurance.

§ 14-301 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the state has in Private
Act Charter of 1953 and subsequent amendments delegated the responsibility to
units of local government to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and
its legislative body do ordain as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The Mayor and its City Council wish to maintain eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order to do so must meet the
NFIP regulations found in 44 C.F.R. Ch.1, § 60.3.
      (2)   Areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which could
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (3)   Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in
flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is
inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This chapter is designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood
heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community
facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may cause flood hazards to other
lands.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life, health and property;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodable areas;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in a manner as to minimize blight in flood
areas;
      (7)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a floodable area; and
      (8)   To maintain eligibility for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.

include within the proposals base flood elevation data (see division (E) below.
   (C)   Standards for areas of special flood hazard with established base
flood elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in §
14-303(B), are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, debris or erosion
potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to
allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and
velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply.
      (1)   Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new
construction, substantial improvements or other developments within the
regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however; provided, it is
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed
encroachments or new development shall not result in any increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood elevation, velocities or floodway widths
during the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the
community. A state registered professional engineer must provide supporting
technical data, using the same methodologies as in the effective flood
insurance study for the city and certification thereof.
      (2)   New construction or substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of division (A) above.
   (D)   Standards for areas of special flood hazard zones AE with established
base flood elevations, but without floodways designated. Located within the
special flood hazard areas established in §
14-303(B), where streams exist with base flood data provided, but where no
floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply.
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or
substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard,
unless certification by a state registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by
technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
      (2)   New construction or substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of division (A) above.
   (E)   Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and
floodways (A Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in §
14-303(B), where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and
where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply.
      (1)   The Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from any federal, state or
other sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations (see
division (E)(2) below), as criteria for requiring that new construction,
substantial improvements, or other development in approximate A Zones meet the
requirements of division (A) above.
      (2)   Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, include within the
proposals base flood elevation data.
      (3)   Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where the data is not available from other sources,
require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or flood-proofed to a
level of at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in §
14-302). All applicable data including elevations or flood-proofing
certifications shall be recorded as set forth in §
14-304(B). Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with
the standards of division (B) above.
      (4)   Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where the data is not available from other sources, no
encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within
an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater,
measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a state
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot at any point within the city. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
      (5)   New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of division (A)(2) above. Within approximate A Zones, require that those
divisions of this section dealing with the alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and
manufactured homes provisions are complied with as required.
   (F)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones). Located
within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
14-303(B), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in
addition to those set forth in division (A)(2) above apply.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to at least one foot above the flood depth number specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If
no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated, at least three feet above the highest adjacent
grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards
of division (B) above.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential buildings may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be flood-proofed
and designed watertight to be completely flood-proofed to at least one foot
above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. If no depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be
flood proofed to at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. A state
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
for meeting the provisions of this chapter and shall provide such certification
to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in §
14-304(B).
      (3)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide
flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
   (G)   Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99 Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
14-303(B) are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection
system, but where base flood elevations have not been determined. Within these
areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of §
14-304 and this section shall apply.
   (H)   Standards for unmapped streams. Located within the city are unmapped
streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor
identified. Adjacent to the streams the following provisions shall apply.
      (1)   No encroachments including fill material or other development
including structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice
the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless
certification by a state registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the locality.
      (2)   When a new flood hazard risk zone, and base flood elevation and
floodway data is available, new construction and substantial improvements shall
meet the standards established in accordance with §§
14-304 and this section.

to the injury of others;
               b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;
               c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage;
               d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
               e.   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in
the case of a functionally dependent facility;
               f.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
               g.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
               h.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
               i.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and

purposes of this chapter, the Board of Floodplain Review may attach conditions
to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes
of this chapter.
            5.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum relief necessary, considering the flood hazard and the factors
listed in division (A) above.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or chapters.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance (as
high as $25 for $100 coverage, and that the construction below the base flood
elevation increases risks to life and property.
      (4)   The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.

recommendation of the City Arborist or Tree Board and upon verification that
measures will be taken during construction or installation to protect the well
being of the tree.
   (C)   Development. Development within the tree protection zone can be very
detrimental to the health and survival of protected trees. As such, all
development activities, except those specifically permitted by this chapter,
should be avoided within the tree protection zone provided for any protected
trees, including any construction of buildings, structures, paving surfaces and
storm water retention/detention ponds. All temporary construction activities
shall also be avoided within tree protection areas, including all digging,
concrete washing, storage of construction material and parking of construction
vehicles.

§ 14-802 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply.
Words used in the singular shall include the plural, and the plural shall
include the singular; words used in the present tense shall include the future
tense. The word "shall" is mandatory and not discretionary. The word "may" is
permissive. Words not defined in this section shall be construed to have the
meaning given by common and ordinary use as defined in the latest edition of
Webster's Dictionary.
   ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL PENALTIES. Under the authority provided in T.C.A. §
68-221-1106, the city declares that any person violating the provisions of this
chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the city of not less than $50 and
not more than $5,000 per day for each day of violation. Each day of violation
shall constitute a separate violation.
   ANALYTICAL MONITORING. Test procedures for the analysis of pollutants shall
conform to regulations published pursuant to Section 304 (h) of the Clean Water
Act (the "Act"), as amended, under which such procedures may be required.

site runoff, spillage, leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw
material storage. BMPs include source control practices (non-structural BMPs)
and engineered structures designed to treat runoff.
      (1)   Structural BMPs are facilities that help prevent pollutants in
stormwater runoff from leaving the site.
      (2)   Non-structural BMPs are techniques, activities and processes that
reduce pollutants at the source.
   BMP MANUAL. Provides technical guidance including additional policies,
criteria, standards, specifications, constants, and information for the proper
implementation of the requirements of the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System permit (NPDES) and applicable regulations, 40 C.F.R. § 122
as applicable for stormwater discharges.
   BORROW PIT. An excavation from which erodible material (typically soil) is
removed to be fill for another site. There is no processing or separation of
erodible material conducted at the site. Given the nature of activity and
pollutants present at such excavation, a borrow pit is considered a
construction activity.
   BUFFER ZONE or WATER QUALITY RIPARIAN BUFFER. A permanent strip of natural
perennial vegetation, adjacent to a stream, river, wetland, pond, or lake that
contains dense vegetation made up of grass, shrubs, and/or trees. The purpose
of a water quality riparian buffer is to maintain existing water quality by
minimizing risk of any potential sediments, nutrients or other pollutants
reaching adjacent surface waters and to further prevent negative water quality
impacts by providing canopy over adjacent waters.
   CHANNEL. A natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks
that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water.
   CLEARING. Refers to removal of vegetation and disturbance of soil prior to
grading or excavation in anticipation of construction activities. Clearing may
also refer to wide area land disturbance in anticipation of non-construction
activities. Clearing, grading, and excavation do not refer to clearing of
vegetation along existing or new roadways, highways, dams, or power lines for
sight distance or other maintenance and/or safety concerns, or cold planning,
milling, and/or removal of concrete and/or bituminous asphalt roadway pavement

documentation (including a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch,
advertisement, drawing, permit application, zoning request, computer design,
etc.) or physical demarcation (including boundary signs, lot stakes, surveyor
markings, etc.) indicating construction activities may occur on a specific
plot. A common plan of development or sale identifies a situation in which
multiple areas of disturbance are occurring on contiguous areas. This applies
because the activities may take place at different times, on different
schedules, by different operators.
   CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER DISCHARGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES. Activities that cause,
contribute to or result in point source stormwater pollutant discharges. These
activities may include excavation, site development, grading and other surface
disturbance activities; and activities to control stormwater including the

returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural or
silvicultural use.
   POINT SOURCE (or OUTFALL). Any discernible, confined, and discrete
conveyance, including but not limited to, any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel,
conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal
feeding operation, landfill leachate collection system, vessel or other

not include introduction of pollutants from non-point source agricultural and
silvicultural activities, including stormwater runoff from orchards, cultivated
crops, pastures, range lands, forest lands or return flows from irrigated
agriculture or agricultural stormwater runoff. In short, outfall is a point
where runoff leaves the site as a concentrated flow in a discrete conveyance.
   POLLUTANT. Sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes.
   PRIORITY CONSTRUCTION. Those construction activities discharging directly
into, or immediately upstream of, waters the state recognized as unavailable
condition for siltation or Exceptional Tennessee Waters.

suspension, is being transported; or has been moved from the site of origin by
wind, water, gravity or ice as a product of erosion.
   SEDIMENT BASIN. A temporary basin consisting of an embankment constructed
across a wet weather conveyance, an excavation that creates a basin or by a
combination of both. A sediment basin typically consists of a forebay cell,
impoundment, permanent pool, primary spillway, secondary or emergency spillway
and surface dewatering device. The size and shape of the basin depends on the
location, size of drainage area, incoming runoff volume and peak flow, soil
type and particle size, land cover, and receiving stream classification (i.e.,

122.26(b)(l4) and incorporated here by reference. Most relevant to the city is
40 C.F.R. § 122.26(b)(14)(x), which relates to construction activity including
clearing, grading, filling and excavation activities, including borrow pits
containing erodible material. Disturbance of soil for the purpose of crop
production is exempt from NPDES permit requirements, but stormwater discharges
from agriculture-related activities that involve construction of structures
(e.g., barn construction, road construction, pond construction) are considered
associated with industrial (construction) activity. Maintenance to the original
line and grade, hydraulic capacity; or to the original purpose of the facility
(e.g., re-clearing, minor excavation performed around an existing structure
necessary for maintenance or repair and repaving of an existing road) is not
considered a construction activity.

description of measures or practices to control these pollutants, and erosion
and sediment control plans and specifications. The SWPPP should be prepared in
accordance with the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (latest
edition).

has been established on the area of disturbance and construction activity has
temporarily ceased. Under certain conditions, temporary stabilization is
required when construction activities temporarily cease.
   TREATMENT CHEMICALS. Polymers, flocculants or other chemicals used to reduce
turbidity in stormwater discharges by chemically bonding to suspended silts and
other soil materials and causing them to bind together and settle out. Common
examples of anionic treatment chemicals are polyacrylamide-chitosan (PAM-CS).
   TURBIDITY. The cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by individual
particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye,
similar to smoke in air.
   WASTE SITE. An area where material from a construction site is disposed of.
When the material is erodible, such as soil, the site must be treated as a
construction site.
   WATERS or WATERS OF THE STATE. Any and all water, public or private, on or
beneath the surface of the ground, which are contained within, flow through, or
border upon Tennessee or any portion thereof, except those bodies of water

ownership which do not combine or effect a junction with natural surface or
underground waters.
   WATERS WITH UNAVAILABLE PARAMETERS. Any segment of surface waters that has
been identified by the TDEC as failing to support one or more classified uses.
Unavailable parameters exist where water quality is at, or fails to meet, the
levels specified in water quality criteria in Rule 0400-40-03-.03, even if
caused by natural conditions. In the case of a criterion that is a single
response variable or is derived from measurement of multiple response
variables, the unavailable parameters shall be the agents causing water quality
to be at or failing to meet the levels specified in criteria. Resources to be
used in making this determination include biennial compilations of impaired
waters, databases of assessment information, updated GIS coverages (https://
tdeconline.tn.gov/dwr/), and the results of recent field surveys. GIS coverages
of the streams and lakes not meeting water quality standards, plus the biennial
list of waters with unavailable parameters, can be found at https://www.tn.gov/
environment/ program-areas/wr-water-resources/water-quality/water-quality-
reports---publications.html.
   WATER QUALITY RIPARIAN BUFFER. A permanent strip of natural perennial
vegetation adjacent to a stream, river, wetland, pond, or lake that contains
dense vegetation made up of grass, shrubs, and/or trees. The purpose of a water
quality riparian buffer is to maintain existing water quality by minimizing the
risk of any potential sediments, nutrients, or other pollutants reaching
adjacent surface waters and to further prevent negative water quality impacts
by providing canopy over adjacent waters.
   WATER QUALITY TREATMENT VOLUME (WQTV). A portion of the runoff generated
from impervious surfaces at a new development or redevelopment project by the
1-year 24-hour design storm. The WQTV is further determined by the type of
treatment provided.
   WET WEATHER CONVEYANCES. Man-made or natural watercourses, including natural
watercourses that have been modified by channelization, that meet the
following:
      (1)   The conveyance carries flow only in direct response to
precipitation runoff in its immediate locality.
      (2)   The conveyance's channels are at all times above the groundwater
table.
      (3)   The flow carried by the conveyance is not suitable for drinking
water supplies.
      (4)   Hydrological and biological analyses indicate that, due to
naturally occurring ephemeral or low flow under normal weather conditions,
there is not sufficient water to support fish or multiple populations of
obligate lotic aquatic organisms whose life cycle includes an aquatic phase of
at least two months. (Tennessee Rules, Chapter 0400-40-3-.04(3)).

      (1)   Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been
either partially or wholly cleared by development activities shall be
stabilized. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as possible in
portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or
permanently ceased. Temporary or permanent soil stabilization at the
construction site (or a phase of the project) must be completed not later than
14 days after the construction activity in that portion of the site has
temporarily or permanently ceased. In the following situations, temporary
stabilization measures are not required:
         (a)   Where the initiation of stabilization measures is precluded by
snow cover or frozen ground conditions or adverse soggy ground conditions,
stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable; or
         (b)   Where construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing activities will be resumed within 14
days.
      (2)   For steep slopes of 35% or more, stabilization measures shall be
initiated within seven days.
      (3)   Construction buffer zones. Construction buffer zones shall be those
water quality buffers and buffer zones as defined in §
14-802 and shall meet the requirements in this chapter and, where appropriate
in the TN CGP. The criteria for the width of the construction buffer zone can
be established on an average width basis at a project, as long as the minimum
width of the buffer zone is more than the required minimum width at any
measured location. If the new development or redevelopment site encompasses
both sides of a stream, buffer averaging can be applied to both sides, but must
be applied independently. Water quality riparian buffer widths are measured
from the top of bank also referred to as the "ordinary high-water mark."
Construction buffers are not primary sediment control measures and shall not be
relied on as such. Stormwater discharges must enter the water quality riparian
buffer zone as sheet flow, not as concentrated flow, where site conditions
allow. The designer/operator must comply with the vegetation requirements and
the permissible land uses set forth for buffers in the TN CGP. Where it is not
practicable to maintain a construction water quality riparian buffer, BMPs
providing equivalent protection to a receiving stream as a natural water
quality riparian buffer must be used.
      (4)   In arid, semiarid, and drought-stricken areas where initiating
vegetative stabilization measures immediately is infeasible, alternative
stabilization measures such as properly anchored mulch, soil binders or matting
must be employed.
   (L)   Notice of termination (NOT). The operator shall provide the city with
a copy of the NOT when it is issued by TDEC.
   (M)   As built plans (record drawings). All applicants are required to
submit actual as built plans certified by the design engineer for any
structures located on-site after final construction is completed. The plan must
show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities
and must be sealed by a registered professional engineer licensed to practice
in Tennessee. A certification by the design engineer certifying that SCM's will
function within original design parameters as constructed shall be included. A
final inspection by the city is required before any performance security or
performance bond will be released. The city shall have the discretion to adopt
provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security or
performance bond on the completion of various stages of development. In
addition, occupation permits shall not be granted until corrections to all
BMP's/SCM's have been made and accepted by the city. No bonds or securities
shall be released by the city until the (stormwater manger) has accepted the as
built plans. The warranty period for any infrastructure to be accepted by the
city for maintenance shall not commence until the city has accepted the as
built plans.
   (N)   Equipment manufacturer startups. No bonds or securities shall be
released until any equipment to be maintained by the city passes any specified
manufacturer startup procedure. The warranty period shall not commence prior to
the equipment passing any specified manufacturer startup procedure.
(Ord. 1722, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 14-804 PERMANENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT: DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION.
   (A)   In order to comply with the city's permanent stormwater standards for
new development and redevelopment projects, design and install SCMs as
established by Tennessee Rule 0400-40-10-.04 and comply with other requirements
of Tennessee Rule 0400-40-10-.04. Note that for design purposes, total
suspended solids (TSS) may be used as the indicator for the reduction of
pollutants.
   (B)   SCMs must be designed to provide full treatment capacity within 72
hours following the end of the preceding rain event for the life of the new
development or redevelopment project. The designer may select from the most
appropriate alternatives listed in the city's BMP Manual.
   (C)   Designs shall be based on the 24-hour design storm adopted by the
city:
      (1)   The city has adopted, for use in designing water quality SCMs, the
design storm requirements as established in Tennessee Rule 0400-40-10-.04. The
post construction/permanent water quality design storm is a 1-year, 24-hour
storm event for water quality SCMs. See definition of design storm event for
the municipality's rainfall amounts for each return period interval.
         (a)   Anyone disturbing one or more acres: 1-year 24-hour Water
Quality= 3.02
      (2)   Any commercial or industrial site must submit calculations for the
2-year, 5-year, and 10-year storm designs. If post construction runoff flows
are increased by two cubic feet per second (cfs) from pre development flows,
the following storm designs are required:
         (a)   2-year: Water Quantity= 3.61
         (b)   5-year: Water Quantity = 4.40
         (c)   10-year: Water Quantity = 5.02
   (D)   Water quality riparian buffers. Post construction/permanent water
quality riparian buffers shall be those buffers defined in §
14-802 and shall meet the requirements described in this chapter. The criteria
for the width of the post construction/permanent buffer zone can be established
on an average width basis at a project, as long as the minimum width of the
buffer zone is more than the required minimum width at any measured location.
If the new development or redevelopment site encompasses both sides of a
stream, buffer averaging can be applied to both sides, but must be applied
independently. Water quality riparian buffer widths are measured from the top
of bank also referred to as the "ordinary high-water mark." Stormwater
discharges should enter the post construction/permanent water quality riparian
buffer as sheet flow, not as concentrated flow, where site conditions allow.
   (E)   Post construction/permanent buffers for waters with available
parameters for siltation or habitat alteration or unassessed waters:
      (1)   Average buffer width: 30 feet.
      (2)   Minimum buffer width: 15 feet.

   This section shall apply to all water generated on developed or undeveloped
land entering the city's
separate storm sewer system.
   (A)   Prohibition of illicit discharges. No person shall introduce or cause
to be introduced into the municipal separate storm sewer system any discharge
that is not composed entirely of stormwater. No person shall allow discharges
that flow from a stormwater facility that is not inspected in accordance with §
14-806. Non-stormwater discharges shall include, but shall not be limited to,
sanitary wastewater, car wash wastewater, radiator flushing disposal, spills
from roadway accidents, carpet cleaning wastewater, effluent from septic tanks,
improper oil disposal, laundry wastewater/gray water, improper disposal of auto
and household toxics. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any non-
stormwater discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system is prohibited
except as described as follows:
      (1)   Water line flushing;
      (2)   Landscape irrigation;
      (3)   Diverted stream flows;
      (4)   Rising ground waters;
      (5)   Uncontaminated ground water infiltration; (INFILTRATION is defined
as water other than wastewater that enters a sewer system, including sewer
service connections and foundation drains, from the ground through such means
as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections, or manholes. Infiltration does
not include, and is distinguished from, inflow.)
      (6)   Uncontaminated pumped ground water;
      (7)   Discharges from potable water sources;
      (8)   Air conditioning condensation;

      (18)   Discharges or flows from firefighting activities.
Unless the city determines they are significant contributors of pollutants to
the MS4.
   (B)   Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance
or continued existence of illicit connections to the municipal separate storm
sewer system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without
limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the
connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection. This prohibition expressly includes SCM's connected to
the system not properly inspected and maintained in accordance with this
chapter.
      (1)   Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the
person's expense, the BMP's necessary to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. Discharges
from existing SCM's that have not been maintained and/or inspected in
accordance with this chapter shall be prohibited.
   (C)   Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting in, or may result in,
illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into, the municipal separate storm
sewer system, the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials the person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the city
in person or by telephone, fax, or email, no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.
   (D)   No illegal dumping allowed. No person shall dump or otherwise deposit
outside an authorized landfill, convenience center or other authorized garbage
or trash collection point, any trash or garbage of any kind or description on
any private or public property, occupied or unoccupied, inside the city. Such
illegal activity exposes runoff to contamination, generating an illicit
discharge. Therefore, any individual or corporation guilty of illegal dumping
may have committed a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 1722, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 14-808 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Enforcement authority. The city shall have the authority to issue
notices of violation and citations, and to impose civil penalties to anyone

activities to be halted, except for those activities directed at cleaning up,
abating discharge, and installing appropriate control measures.
      (5)   Withholding of plan approvals or other authorizations. Where a
facility is in noncompliance, the city's own approval process affecting the
facility's ability to discharge to the MS4 can be used to abate the violation.
      (6)   Additional measures. The city may also use other escalated measures
provided under local legal authorities. The city may perform work necessary to
improve erosion control measures and collect the funds from the responsible
party in an appropriate manner, such as collecting against the project's bond
or directly billing the responsible party to pay for work and materials.
   (B)   Notification of violation.
      (1)   Verbal warning. Verbal warning may be given at the discretion of
the inspector when it appears the condition can be corrected by the violator
within a reasonable time, which time shall be approved by the inspector.
      (2)   Written notice. Whenever the city finds that any permittee or any
other person discharging stormwater has violated or is violating this chapter
or a permit or order issued hereunder, the city may serve upon such person
written notice of the violation. Within ten days of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the city.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
      (3)   Consent orders. The city is empowered to enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will
include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance
within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the
same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions (B)
(4) and (B)(5) below.
      (4)   Show cause hearing. The city may order any person who violates this
chapter or permit, or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the person
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action
and the reasons for such action, and a request that the violator show cause why
this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing.
      (5)   Compliance order. When the city finds that any person has violated
or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued thereunder, he
or she may issue an order to the violator directing that, following a specific
time period, adequate structures or devices be installed and/or procedures
implemented and properly operated. Orders may also contain such other
requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the construction of appropriate structures,
installation of devices, self-monitoring, and management practices.
      (6)   Cease and desist and stop work orders. When the city finds that any
person has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, the city may issue a stop work order or an order to cease and
desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
         (a)   Comply forthwith; or
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation; including
halting operations except for terminating the discharge and installing
appropriate control measures.
      (7)   Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The city may
suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the land development project
or any other project of the applicant or other responsible person within the
city. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the
applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth
in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described
therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon such conditions as the
city may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other responsible person to
take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations.
      (8)   Conflicting standards. Whenever there is a conflict between any
standard contained in this chapter and in the BMP manual(s) adopted by the city
under this chapter, the strictest standard shall prevail.
(Ord. 7122, passed 8-13-2024)
§ 14-809 PENALTIES AND VIOLATIONS.

$5,000 per day for each day of violation. Each day of violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
   (C)   Measuring civil penalties. In assessing a civil penalty, the city
shall consider:
      (1)   The harm done to the public health or the environment;
      (2)   Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial economic
deterrent to the illegal activity;
      (3)   The economic benefit gained by the violator;
      (4)   The amount of effort put forth by the violator to remedy this
violation;
      (5)   Any unusual or extraordinary enforcement costs incurred by the
city. The amount of penalty established by ordinance or resolution for specific
categories of violations; and
      (6)   Any equities of the situation which outweigh the benefit of
imposing any penalty or damage assessment.
   (D)   Recovery of damages and costs. In addition to the civil penalty in
division (B) above, the city may recover:
      (1)   All damages proximately caused by the violator to the city, which

be effective notwithstanding any traffic-control signal indication to proceed.
(1989 Code, § 15-503)
§ 15-504 AT "STOP" SIGNS.
   The driver of a vehicle facing a "stop" sign shall bring his or her vehicle

§ 15-506 AT TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNALS GENERALLY.
   (A)   Traffic-control signals exhibiting the words "Go," "Caution" or "Stop"
or exhibiting different colored lights successively one at a time, or with
arrows, shall show the following colors only and shall apply to drivers of
vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
      (1)   Green alone or "Go".
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through
or turn right or left unless a sign at the place prohibits the turn. But
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the
right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
      (2)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution".
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
red or "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and the
vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red
or "Stop" signal is exhibited.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter the roadway unless
authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal.
      (3)   Steady red alone or "Stop".
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "Go" is
shown alone.
         (b)   A right turn on a red signal shall be permitted at intersections
within the city; provided that, the prospective turning car shall come to a
full and complete stop before turning and that the turning car shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and cross traffic traveling in accordance with
their traffic signal. However, the turn will not endanger other traffic
lawfully using the intersection. A right turn on red shall be permitted at all
intersections, except those that are clearly marked by a "No Turns on Red" sign
erected by the city.
         (c)   The driver of a motorcycle approaching an intersection that is
controlled by a traffic-control signal utilizing a vehicle detection device
that is inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle shall come to a full and
complete stop at the intersection and, after exercising due care as provided by
law, may proceed with due caution when it is safe to do so. It is not a defense
to §
15-108 that the driver of a motorcycle proceeded under the belief that a
traffic-control signal utilized a vehicle detection device or was inoperative
due to the size of the motorcycle when the signal did not utilize a vehicle
detection device or that any device was not in fact inoperative due to the size
of the motorcycle.
         (d)   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter the roadway unless
authorized to do so by a pedestrian "Walk" signal.
      (4)   Steady red with green arrow.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter the roadway unless
authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal.
   (B)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable, except as to those provisions which, by their
nature, can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any sign or marking the stop shall be made a vehicle length short of
the signal.
(1989 Code, § 15-507, modified)
§ 15-507 AT FLASHING TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal placed or erected in the city, it shall require obedience by
vehicular traffic as follows.
   (A)   Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or if
none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (B)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past the signal only with caution.
(1989 Code, § 15-508, modified)
§ 15-508 AT PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Wherever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or
"Wait" or "Don't Walk" have been placed or erected by the city, the signals
shall apply as follows.
   (A)   "Walk". Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (B)   "Wait" or "Don't Walk". No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway
in the direction of the signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
his or her crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to the nearest sidewalk or
safety zone while the wait signal is showing.
(1989 Code, § 15-509)
§ 15-509 STOPS TO BE SIGNALED.
   No person operating a motor vehicle shall stop the vehicle, whether in
obedience to a traffic sign or signal or otherwise, without first signaling his
or her intention in accordance with the requirements of the state law, except
in an emergency.

§ 18-127 DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN.
   (A)   Purpose. Envisioning that the growth of the city, unforeseen weather
conditions, energy failures or equipment failures may produce a water shortage
with little or no advance warning, an emergency plan to conserve water supplied
by the city to its citizens is absolutely necessary for the health, safety and
general welfare of the residents of the city and all other persons who may be
working or sojourning therein; therefore the aforesaid public purpose of the
within section, the short title of which shall be known as "City of Crossville
Drought Contingency Plan".
   (B)   Plan and procedure.
      (1)   Drought and other conditions tending to reduce the city's water
supply shall be monitored by the director of water resources who shall report
to the City Manager when the conditions appear to indicate that actions may
need to be implemented to conserve water. The City Manager shall then promptly
advise the City Council that a water shortage may be eminent and the Council
may then order water conservation measures it finds appropriate from the facts
of the situation, in a manner and upon public notice thereof, not inconsistent
with this section.
      (2)   When the City Council, in regular or special session assembled,
finds that conservation action is necessary to conserve water provided by the
city through its water and fire protection system, it may order one or more of
the following water conservation phases:
         (a)   Phase I.
            1.   No outside watering;
            2.   No car washing; or
            3.   No filling or cleaning of pools
         (b)   Phase II. Professional offices, commercial, industrial and
institutional users (other than hospitals and nursing homes): usage shall be
limited to domestic use consumption (bathrooms and drinking fountains only)
during the hours open for business.
         (c)   Phase III. Residential users, motels/hotels, hospitals, and
nursing homes will be urged to conserve water.
         (d)   Public notification. When one or more phases of water
conservation have been ordered by the City Council, the City Manager shall
immediately notify all local news media, and shall immediately contract for
public advertisements in all the local news media, the advertisements setting
forth the phase or phases ordered by the City Council, and that violators of
the order, upon conviction, may be punished as provided in this section. Water
conservation orders enacted by the City Council shall remain in full force and
effect until lifted by the council in regular or special meeting session
assembled. Public notice of the lifting need only be made by the City Manager
through prompt news releases to all local news media.
         (e)   Enforcement. During times when the City Council has ordered
water conservation measures under this section, duly authorized officers of the
city, bearing proper credentials and identification, may enter private property
at times and in the manner provided by law, when the officers have reason to
believe probable cause exists that emergency provisions of this section are
being violated. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall, upon
conviction in the municipal court of the city, be guilty of a misdemeanor and
be assessed a fine of not less than $10, nor more than $50.
(1989 Code, § 18-127)

service;
         (c)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater treatment system which will interfere with the system operation,
will cause the city's discharge to violate its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit or other applicable state requirements, will
cause physical damage to the wastewater treatment system facilities;
         (d)   To provide for full and equitable distribution of the cost of
the wastewater treatment system;
         (e)   To enable the city to comply with the provisions of the Federal
Clean Water Act, the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 C.F.R. part 403), and
other applicable federal and state laws and regulations; and
         (f)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters
and sludges from the wastewater treatment system.
      (2)   In meeting these objectives, this chapter provides that all persons
in the service areas of the city must have adequate wastewater treatment either
in the form of a connection to the city wastewater treatment system or, where
the system is not available, an appropriate private disposal system. The
chapter also provides for the issuance of permits to system users, for the
regulation of wastewater discharge volumes and characteristics, for monitoring
and enforcement activities; and for the setting of fees for the full and
equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation, maintenance and
capital recovery of the wastewater treatment system and from other activities
required by the enforcement and administrative program established herein.
      (3)   This chapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside the
city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the municipal
wastewater treatment system. Except as otherwise provided herein, the City

   (B)   Regulation of industrial user spills and batch discharges. The city
shall randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and
conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of
information supplied by industrial users, of occasional and continuing non-
compliance with pretreatment standards by inspecting and sampling the effluent
from each significant industrial user at least once a year and evaluating, at
least once every two years, whether each the significant IU needs a plan to
control slug discharges (spills and/or batch discharges). For purposes of this
division, a slug discharge includes, but is not limited to, an accidental spill
or a non-customary batch discharge. The results of the activities shall be
available to the city upon request. If the city decides that a slug control
plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the City Manager of slug
discharge, including any discharges that would violate a prohibition under 40
C.R.F. § 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within
five days.
      (4)   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental
spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and
transfer of materials, loading and unloading operation, control of plant site
run-off, worker training, building of containment structures of equipment,
measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and/or
measures and equipment for emergency responses.
   (C)   Hazardous waste notification requirements.
      (1)   The industrial user shall notify the City Manager, the EPA Regional
Waste Management
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any
discharge in the city wastewater system of a substance, which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. The
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40
C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the IU discharges more than 100 kilograms of
the waste per calendar month to the city wastewater system, the notification
shall also contain the following information to the extent the information is
known and readily available to the IU: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the waste, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of the constituents in the wastestream discharged during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this
rule. IUs who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall
provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the
listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12
(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants
already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12
(b), (d) and (e).
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (C)(1)
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms
of hazardous waste, unless the waste is acute hazardous waste as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms
of non-acute hazardous waste in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute
hazardous waste as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the IU discharges more
than the quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the IU must notify the City Manager, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the effective
date of the regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under any part of this
section, the IU shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   (D)   Limitations on discharge strength,
Table 1. No person or user shall discharge wastewater which exceeds the
following set of standards (
Table 1 - Limitations on Discharge Strength) unless an exception is permitted
as provided in this chapter. Dilution of any wastewater discharge for the
purpose of satisfying these requirements shall be considered in violation of
this chapter.
   (E)   Protection of treatment plant influent. The City Manager shall monitor
the treatment works influent for each parameter in the following table. (
Table 2 - Plant Protection Criteria.) Industrial users shall be subject to
report and monitoring requirements regarding these parameters as set forth in
this chapter. In the event that the influent at the POTW reaches or exceeds the
levels established by this table, the City Manager shall initiate technical
studies to determine the cause of the influent violation and shall recommend to
the city the necessary remedial measures, including, but not limited to,
recommending the establishment of new or revised pretreatment levels for these
parameters. The City Manager shall also recommend changes to any of these
criteria in the event that: the POTW effluent standards are changed, there are
changes in any applicable law or regulation affecting same or changes are
needed for more effective operation of the POTW.
   (F)   Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of
the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial
subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed
under the chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede
the limitations imposed under this chapter. The City Manager shall notify all
affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. §
403.12.
   (G)   Right to establish more restrictive criteria. No statement in this
chapter is intended or may be construed to prohibit the City Manager from
establishing specific wastewater discharge criteria more restrictive where
wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the facilities of the
POTW or to create a public nuisance, or to cause the discharge of the POTW to
violate effluent or stream quality standards, or to interfere with the use of
handling of sludge, or to pass through the POTW resulting in a violation of the
NPDES permit, or to exceed industrial pretreatment standards for discharge to
municipal wastewater treatment systems as imposed or as may be imposed by the
State Department of Environment and Conservation and/or the United States
Environmental Protection Agency.
   (H)   Exceptions to discharge criteria.
      (1)   Application for exception.
         (a)   Non-residential users of the POTW may apply for a temporary
exception to the prohibited and restricted wastewater discharge criteria listed
in divisions (A) and (B) above. Exceptions can be granted according to the
following guidelines.
         (b)   The City Manager shall allow applications for temporary
exceptions at any time. However, the City Manager shall not accept an
application if the applicant has submitted the same or substantially similar
application within the preceding year and the same has been denied by the city.
         (c)   All applications for an exception shall be in writing, and shall
contain sufficient information for evaluation of each of the factors to be
considered by the city in its review of the application.
      (2)   Conditions.
         (a)   All exceptions granted under this division shall be temporary
and subject to revocation at any time by the City Manager upon reasonable
notice.
         (b)   The user requesting the exception must demonstrate to the City
Manager that he or she is making a concentrated and serious effort to maintain
high standards of operation control and housekeeping levels and the like, so
that discharges to the POTW are being minimized. If negligence is found,
permits will be subject to termination. The user requesting the exception must
demonstrate that compliance with stated concentration and quantity standards is
technically or economically infeasible and the discharge, if expected, will
not:
            1.   Interfere with the normal collection and operation of the
wastewater treatment system;
            2.   Limit the sludge management alternatives available and
increase the cost of providing adequate sludge management; and
            3.   Pass through the POTW in quantities and/or concentrations that
would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit.
         (c)   The user must show that the exception, if granted, will not
cause the discharger to violate its in-force federal pretreatment standards
unless the exception is granted under the provisions of the applicable
pretreatment regulations.
         (d)   A surcharge shall be applied to any exception granted under this
division (H)(2). These surcharges shall be applied for that concentration of
the pollutant for which the variance has been granted in excess of the
concentration stipulated in this chapter based on the average daily flow of the
user.
      (3)   Review of application by the City Manager. All applications for an
exception shall be reviewed by the City Manager. If the application does not
contain sufficient information for complete evaluation, the City Manager shall
notify the applicant of the deficiencies and request additional information.
The applicant shall have 30 days following notification by the City Manager to
correct the deficiencies. This 30-day period may be extended by the city upon
application and for just cause shown. Upon receipt of a complete application,
the City Manager shall evaluate same within 30 days and shall submit his or her
recommendations to the city at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
      (4)   Review of application by the city. The city shall review and
evaluate all applications for exceptions and shall take into account the
following factors:
         (a)   Whether or not the applicant is subject to a national
pretreatment standard containing discharge limitations more stringent than
those in this section and grant an exception only if the exception may be
granted within limitations of applicable federal regulations;
         (b)   Whether or not the exception would apply to discharge of a
substance classified as a toxic substance under regulations promulgated by the
Environmental Protection Agency under the provisions of § 307(a) of the Act (33
U.S.C. § 1317) and then grant an exception only if the exception may be granted
within the limitations of applicable federal regulations.
         (c)   Whether or not the granting of an exception would create
conditions that would reduce the effectiveness of the treatment works taking
into consideration the concentration of the pollutant in the treatment works
influent and the design capability of the treatment works.
         (d)   The cost of pretreatment or other types of control techniques
which would be necessary for the user to achieve effluent reduction, but
prohibitive costs alone shall not be the basis for granting an exception;
         (e)   The age of equipment and industrial facilities involved to the
extent that the factors affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge;
         (f)   The process employed by the user and process changes available
which would affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge;
         (g)   The engineering aspects of various types of pretreatment or
other control techniques available to the user to improve the quality or
quantity of wastewater discharge;
         (h)   Accidental discharge.
            1.   Protection from accidental discharge.
               a.   All industrial users shall provide the facilities and
institute the procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent or minimize the
potential for accidental discharge into the POTW of waste regulated by this
chapter from liquid or raw material storage areas, from truck and rail car
loading and unloading areas, from in-plant transfer or processing and materials
handling areas, and from diked areas or holding ponds of any waste regulated by
this section. The wastewater discharge permit of any user who has a history of
significant leaks, spills or other accidental discharge or waste regulated by
this chapter shall be subject on a case by case basis to a special permit
condition or requirement for the construction of facilities, establishment of
procedures which will prevent or minimize the potential for the accidental
discharge. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing
the facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City Manager
before the facility is constructed.
               b.   The review and approval of the plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
            2.   Notification of accidental discharge.
               a.   Any person causing or suffering from any accidental
discharge shall immediately notify the City Manager (or his or her designated
official) by telephone to enable counter-measures to be taken by the City
Manager to minimize damage to the POTW, the health and welfare of the public
and the environment.
               b.   This notification shall be followed, within five days of
the date of occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the cause of
the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future
occurrence.
               c.   The notification will not relieve the user of liability for
any expense, loss or damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to
person or property; not shall the notification relieve the user of any fines,
civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or
state or federal law.
            3.   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on
the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer the a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(1989 Code, § 18-206)
§ 18-207 INDUSTRIAL USER MONITORING, INSPECTION REPORTS, RECORDS AND SAFETY.
   (A)   Monitoring facilities.
      (1)   The installation of a monitoring facility shall be required for all
industrial users having wastes which receive pretreatment, are otherwise
altered or regulated before discharge, or are unusually strong and thereby
subject to a surcharge. Monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other
suitable facility approved by the City Manager.
      (2)   When, in the judgment of the City Manager, there is a significant
difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different
operations of a single user, the City Manager may require that separate
monitoring facilities be installed for each separate source of discharge.
      (3)   Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be
constructed and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility
is to enable inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced
by a user. If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the City
Manager, it shall be provided and installed at the user's expense.
      (4)   The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on
the user's premises outside of the building. The City Manager may, however,
when the a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user,
allow the facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right-of-way and
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (5)   There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
      (6)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City Manager's
requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and
specifications. Construction must be completed within 180 days following
written notification unless an extension is granted by the City Manager.
   (B)   Inspection and sampling.
      (1)   The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection,
sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of its duties. The
city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property the devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into his or her premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with his or her security guards so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA
will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing its
specific responsibility.
      (2)   The City Manager or his or her representatives shall have no
authority to inquire into any manufacturing process beyond that point having a
direct bearing on the level and sources of discharge to the sewers, waterways
or facilities for waste treatment.
   (C)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
City Manager a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants
in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the user facility which are limited by the pretreatment
standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
user in compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements.
This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user and certified to by a qualified professional.
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance
date of the pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the City Manager
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the City Manager, a report indicating the nature
and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by the
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all
daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily
flow. At the discretion of the City Manager and in consideration of the factors
as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles and the like, the City
Manager may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be
submitted.
      (2)   The City Manager may impose mass limitations on users where the
imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In the cases, the report
required by division (D)(3) of this section standards in the effluent of the
user.
      (3)   The reports required by this section shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where requested by the City Manager, of
pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment
standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the wastewater
discharge permit or the pretreatment standard. All analyses shall be performed
in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to §
304(g) of the Clean Water Act and contained in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and
amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the City
Manager. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved
by the City Manager.
   (E)   Maintenance of records.
      (1)   Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements
established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting
from any monitoring activities required by this section. The records shall
include for all samples:
         (a)   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names
of the persons taking the samples;
         (b)   The dates analyses were performed;
         (c)   Who performed the analyses;
         (d)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
         (e)   The results of the analyses.
      (2)   Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirement
established in this section shall be required to retain for a minimum of three
years all records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not the
monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make the records
available for inspection and copying by the City Manager, Director of the
Division of Water Pollution Control, State Department of Environment and
Conservation or the Environmental Protection Agency. This period of retention
shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the
industrial user or when requested by the City Manager, the approval authority
or the Environmental Protection Agency.
   (F)   Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties, the
City Manager or duly authorized employees of the city shall observe all safety
rules applicable to the premises established by the company and the company
shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the city
shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by city
employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or
property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the monitoring
and sampling operation, except as the may be caused by negligence or failure of
the company to maintain safe conditions.
(1989 Code, § 18-207)
§ 18-208 ENFORCEMENT AND ABATEMENT, FINES AND PENALTY COSTS.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, or a wastewater
permit or order issued hereunder, the City Manager will serve upon the user
written notice of the violation. This will be the first step in the Enforcement
Response Guide (
Appendix A). Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the City
Manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
(See
Appendix A.)
   (B)   Consent orders. When the Superintendent finds that an industrial user
has violated this chapter or permit, the City Manager is empowered to enter
into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for
the non-compliance. The orders will include specific action to be taken by the
industrial user to correct the non-compliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as
administrative orders issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. When the Superintendent finds that an industrial
user has violated this chapter or permit, the City Manager may order any
industrial user which causes or contributes to a violation of this chapter or
wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause before the City
Council why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action and the reasons for the action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. The notice
may be served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate officer.
Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, immediate
enforcement action may be pursued.
   (D)   Compliance order. When the Superintendent finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate the ordinance or a permit or order
issued thereunder, the City Manager may issue an order to the industrial user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are
properly operated. Orders may also contain the other requirements as might be
reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the non-compliance, including
the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and
management practices.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders. When the Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit
or order issued hereunder, the City Manager may issue an order to cease and
desist all the violations and direct those persons in non-compliance to:
      (1)   Comply forthwith; and
      (2)   Take the appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and terminating the discharge.
   (F)   Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter,
or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined according to the fine
schedule below (
Table 3 - Violations/Offense Fine Schedule). Each day on which non-compliance
shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. The
assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and
the city shall have the other collection remedies as it has to collect other
service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall constitute a lien
against the individuals user's property. Industrial users desiring to dispute
the fines must file a request for the city to reconsider the fine within ten
days of being notified on the fine. Where the City Manager believes a request
has merit, he or she shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of
receiving the request from the industrial user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that an industrial user has violated
this chapter or permit, the City Manager may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or wastewater permit of an industrial user whenever the suspension
is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or
causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, the POTW or the environment.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate this
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the City Manager shall take the steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment
to any individuals. The City Manager shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the endangerment has passed unless the termination proceedings
set forth in division (H) below are initiated against the user.
      (3)   An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence to the City Manager prior to the date service is re-established.
   (H)   Termination of permit.
      (1)   Significant industrial users proposed to discharge into the POTW,
must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the city. Any user who
violates the following conditions of this chapter or a wastewater discharge
permit or order, or any applicable or state and federal law, is subject to
permit termination:
         (a)   Violation of permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics; and
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
      (2)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show
cause under division (C) above why the proposed action should not be taken.
   (I)   Judicial remedies. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes
or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions
of this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, the City Manager,
through the City Attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the Chancery Court of Cumberland County.
   (J)   Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued
hereunder, the City Manager through counsel may petition the court for the
issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the
industrial user. The city shall have the remedies to collect these fees as it
has to collect other sewer service charges.
   (K)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any industrial user who has violated or continues to violate this
chapter or any order or permit hereunder, shall be liable to the city for a
civil penalty of at least $1,000 per day plus actual damages incurred by the
POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition
to the above-described penalty and damages, the city may recover reasonable
attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses associated with the enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
      (2)   The city shall petition the court to impose, assess and recover the
sums. In determining the amount of liability, the court shall take into account
all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit
gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective actions by the
industrial user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
   (L)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   Violations; generally.
         (a)   Any industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this chapter or any orders or permits issued hereunder, shall,
upon conviction, by guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed
$1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or
both.
         (b)   In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be
punishable by a fine not to exceed $3,000 per violation per day or imprisonment
for not more than three years or both.
      (2)   Falsifying information.
         (a)   Any industrial user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or
other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or
wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders
inaccurate, any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall,
upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation.
         (b)   In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be
punishable by a fine not to exceed $3,000 per violation per day or imprisonment
for not more than three years or both.
   (M)   Annual publication of significant violations. When the Superintendent
finds that an industrial user has violated this chapter or permit, the City
Manager shall publish, at least annually in the largest newspaper circulated in
the service area, a description of those industrial users which are found to be
in significant violation, as defined in division (Q) below, with any provisions
of this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder during the period since
the previous publication.
   (N)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit
issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and
service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (O)   Affirmative defenses.
      (1)   Any industrial user which experiences an upset in operations that
places it in a temporary state of non-compliance, which is not the result of
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation, shall inform the City Manager thereof immediately upon becoming
aware of the upset. Where the information is given orally, a written report
thereof shall be filed by the user within five days. The report shall contain:
         (a)   A description of the upset, its cause(s) and impact on the
discharger's compliance status;
         (b)   The duration of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
of non-compliance and, if the non-compliance is continuing, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored; and
         (c)   All steps taken, or planned, to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the an upset.
      (2)   An industrial user which complies with the notification provisions
of this section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to any
enforcement action brought by the City Manager for any non-compliance with this
chapter, or an order or permit issued hereunder by the user, which arises out
of violations attributable to and alleged to have occurred during the period of
the documented and verified upset.
   (P)   Treatment bypasses.
      (1)   A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the
following conditions are met:
         (a)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
         (b)   There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the
use of auxiliary treatment or retention of the wastewater; and
         (c)   The industrial user properly notified the Superintendent as
described in division (P)(2) below.
      (2)   Industrial users must provide immediate notice to the City Manager
upon discovery of an unanticipated bypass. If necessary, the Superintendent may
require the industrial user to submit a written report explaining the cause(s),
nature and duration of the bypass, and the steps being taken to prevent its
recurrence.
      (3)   An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
Industrial users anticipating a bypass must submit notice to the City Manager
at least ten days in advance. The City Manager may only approve the anticipated
bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in division (P)(1) above.
   (Q)   Magnitude of the violation.
      (1)   Generally, an isolated instance of non-compliance can be met with
an informal response or a notice of violation.
      (2)   However, since even an isolated violation could threaten public
health and the environment, damage public and private property, or threaten the
integrity of the city's program (e.g., falsifying a self-monitoring report),
EPA recommends that cities respond to any "significant non-compliance" with an
enforceable order that requires a return to compliance by a specific deadline.
EPA has defined significant non-compliance in its general pretreatment
regulations (see 55 FR July 24, 1990) as violations which meet one or more of
the following criteria:
         (a)   Violations of wastewater discharge limits.
            1.   Chronic violations. Sixty-six percent or more of the
measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a
six-month period (any magnitude of exceedance).
            2.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC). Those in which 33% or more of
all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month
period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average
limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants, except pH.
            3.   Any other violation(s) of effluent limit (average or daily
maximum) that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass-through or endangered the health of the sewage
treatment personnel or the public.
            4.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health/welfare or to the environment and has resulted in
the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent the a
discharge.
         (b)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones contained in a
local control mechanism or enforcement order, for starting construction,
completing construction, and attaining final compliance by 90 days or more
after the schedule date;
         (c)   Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-
monitoring data, or categorical standards (baseline monitoring reports, 90-day
compliance reports, and periodic reports) within 30 days from the due date;
         (d)   Failure to accurately report non-compliance; and
         (e)   Any other violation or group of violations that the city
considers to be significant.
(1989 Code, § 18-208)
§ 18-209 FEES AND BILLING.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the
equitable recovery of costs from users of the city's wastewater treatment
system, including costs of operation, maintenance, administration, bond service
costs, capital improvements and depreciation.
   (B)   Types of charges and fees. The charges and fees as established in the
city's schedule of charges and fees may include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Fees for applications for discharge;
      (2)   Inspection fee and tapping fee;
      (3)   Sewer charge;
      (4)   Surcharge fee;
      (5)   Industrial wastewater discharge permit fee;
      (6)   Fees for industrial discharge monitoring; and
      (7)   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Fees for applications for discharge. A fee may be charged when a user
or prospective user makes application for discharge as required by §
18-205.
   (D)   Inspection fee and tapping fee. An inspection fee and tapping fee for
a building sewer installation shall be paid to the city at the time the
application is filed. Fees shall cover the costs of inspecting new and/or
existing plumbing within subject building establishments as well as inspection
of building sewers, property sewers and sewer service lines and connections to
the public sewers. The inspection fee and tapping fee shall be set by the City
Council.
   (E)   Sewer charge.
      (1)   Determination of costs. The City Council shall establish monthly
rates and charges for the use of the wastewater system and for the services
supplied by the wastewater system. The charges shall be based upon the cost
categories of administration costs (including billing and accounting costs),
operation and maintenance costs of the wastewater collection and treatment
system (including replacement) and debt service costs. The sewer charge shall
have two components, namely: user charge and debt service costs.
      (2)   User charge.
         (a)   The user charge shall reflect the costs of administration and
operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the public sewerage
facilities.
         (b)   Each user shall pay its proportionate share of administration
and operation and maintenance (including replacement) costs based on volume of
flow.
         (c)   The City Manager of the sewerage facilities shall review not
less often than every two years the sewage contributions of users, the total
costs of administration and operation and maintenance (including replacement)
of the sewerage facilities and the user charge system. The City Manager shall
recommend to the City Council the user charge (if necessary) to accomplish the
following:
            1.   Maintain the proportionate distribution of administration,
operation and maintenance costs among users as provided herein; and
            2.   Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total administration,
operation and maintenance costs (including replacement) of the sewerage
facilities.
         (d)   All flow to the sewerage facilities not directly attributable to
the users (i.e., infiltration/inflow) shall be distributed among all users of
the sewerage facilities based upon the volume of flow of the users.
         (e)   Each user shall be notified at least annually (in conjunction
with a regular bill) of the rate and that portion of the sewer user charge
which is attributable to administration, and operation and maintenance of the
sewerage facilities.
      (3)   Debt service costs. The sewer charge shall also contain a component
to reflect the costs of debt service incurred in conjunction with capital
expenditures that have previously been made or may be made in the future to
improve, upgrade or extend the public sewerage facilities.
      (4)   Adjustments. The volume of water purchased which is used in the
calculation of sewer use charges may be adjusted by the City Manager if a user
purchases a significant volume of water for a consumptive use and does not
discharge it to the public sewers (i.e., filling swimming pools, industrial
heating and humidifying equipment and the like). The user shall be responsible
for documenting the quantity of waste discharge to the public sewer.
   (F)   Surcharge fees.
      (1)   Should a user of the wastewater system be determined by the City
Manager to be discharging wastewater into the system with an average
biochemical-oxygen demand (BOD) content in excess of 300 mg/l by weight, and/or
an average suspended solids (SS) content in excess of 300 mg/l by weight, the
users shall pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of their wastes.
      (2)   The costs of treatment for each pound of BOD and SS removed by the
sewerage facilities shall be reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and
appropriate surcharge rates applied to the sewage billing. These rates shall be
in effect until the next annual rate review.
      (3)   When either or both the BOD and SS quantities discharged into the
treatment works is in excess of those described in division (F)(1) above, the
following formula shall be used to compute the appropriate surcharge fees with
the total applied to the monthly bill of affected users:
[A(C-300) + B(D-300)]  8.34  x E x F = Surcharge Payment
          1000         ($/Month)
   Where:
      A = Surcharge Rate for BOD in $/lb = $**/lb
      B = Surcharge Rate for SS in $/lb = $**/lb
      C = Industrial User's BOD Concentration in mg/l
      D = Industrial User's SS Concentration in mg/l
      E = Industrial User's Flow to sewerage facilities in 1000 gallons/day
      F = Number of Days in Month
      ** See Rate Schedule for applicable charges.
      (4)   No reduction in sewage service charges, fees or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the sewerage
facilities contain less than 300 mg/l of BOD or 300 mg/l of SS.
      (5)   If it is determined by the city that the discharge of other loading
parameters or wastewater substances are creating excessive operation and
maintenance costs within the wastewater system, whether collection or
treatment, then the monetary effect of the a parameter or parameters shall be
borne by the discharger of the parameters in proportion to the amount of
discharge.
   (G)   Industrial wastewater discharge permit fees. A fee may be charged for
the issuance of an industrial wastewater discharge permit in accordance with §
18-205.
   (H)   Fees for industrial discharge monitoring. Fees may be collected from
industrial users having pretreatment or other discharge requirements to
compensate the city for the necessary compliance monitoring and other
administrative duties of the pretreatment program.
   (I)   Billing. The billing for normal domestic wastewater services shall
consist of monthly billing in accordance with the rates specified by the city,
subject to net and gross rates.
(1989 Code, § 18-209)
§ 18-210 VALIDITY.
   This chapter and its provisions shall be valid for all service areas,
regions and sewage works under the jurisdiction of the city.

   Appendix A contains a drawing of a typical grease interceptor and Appendix B
contains a grease interceptor sizing formula. These are available in the office
of the City Clerk.
§ 18-301 PURPOSE OF THE GREASE CONTROL PROGRAM.
   Grease is one of the primary causes of stoppages, backups and overflows in a
wastewater collection system. Grease buildup in the sewers also causes
restrictions and capacity problems. The city's goal is to improve sewer service
by reducing the impact of grease. This goal will be achieved through two
related programs.
   (A)   Preventive maintenance program. The city's "field control" program,
through which identified grease problem areas are routinely cleaned and
inspected. The city is responsible for the "field control" of grease, through
its normal collection system operations.
   (B)   Grease control program. The city's "source control" program, through
which food service facilities (FSFs) are required to capture and properly
dispose of the grease generated by their operation. The focus of this document
is the grease control program, including the proper sizing, installation and
maintenance of grease interceptors. The administrative and inspection
requirements are established as well. Through the cooperative efforts of FSFs
with the city, the goal of improved sewer service through proper grease control
can be achieved.
§ 18-302 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BLACK WATER. Waste water from sanitary fixtures the as toilets and urinals.
   BULK SERVICE KITCHEN. A facility which prepares bulk quantities of food,
such as hospitals, schools or caterers.
   COMMON GREASE INTERCEPTOR. A device to which grease wastes are directed from
more than one facility having different operators or type of operations, such
as in a food court.
   CUSTOMER. A user of the sanitary sewer system who produces wastes from his,
her or their process operations. The CUSTOMER is responsible for assuring that
the produced waste is disposed of in accordance with all federal, state and
local disposal regulations.
   FOOD COURTS. Areas predominantly found in shopping centers or amusement
parks and festivals where several food preparation establishments having
different owners may be sharing seating space and/or plumbing facilities.
   FOOD SERVICE FACILITY (FSF). Any facility, which cuts, cooks, bakes,
prepares or serves food, or which disposes of food related wastes.
   GARBAGE GRINDER. A device which shreds or grinds up solid or semi-solid
waste materials into smaller portions for discharge into the sanitary sewer
collection system.
   GRAY WATER. Refers to all wastewater other than "black water", as defined in
this section.
   GREASE. A material composed primarily of fats, oil and grease from animal or
vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil and grease shall be deemed as grease by
definition. GREASE does not include petroleum-based products.
   GREASE INTERCEPTOR. A large tank or device so constructed as to separate and
trap or hold fats, oil, and grease substances from the sewage discharged from a
facility in order to keep fats, oil and grease substances from entering the
sanitary sewer collection system. GREASE INTERCEPTORS are located outside of
food service facilities.
   HAULER. One who transfers waste from the site of a customer to an approved
site for disposal or treatment. The HAULER is responsible for assuring that all
federal, state and local regulations are followed regarding waste transport.
   NPDES. Stands for National Pollution Discharge Elimination System under
which the city's wastewater treatment plant is permitted.
   POTW. Stands for publicly-owned treatment works or "treatment works" as
defined by § 212 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1292) which is owned by
the city. This definition includes any sewers that convey wastewater to city's
sewage treatment plant.
   PRETREATMENT COORDINATOR. An individual employed by the city who is charged
with the responsibility of administering the provisions of the pretreatment
program to ensure compliance by users with applicable laws, rules, regulations
and ordinances relative to the concentration(s) of substances found in the
waste stream of facilities connected to the POTW.
   SEWAGE. The liquid and water-carried domestic or industrial wastes from
dwellings, commercial establishments, industrial facilities and institutions,
whether treated or untreated. The terms "waste" and "wastewater" shall be
deemed as SEWAGE by definition.
   SEWER LATERAL. A sewer line or lines maintained and controlled by private
persons for the purpose of conveying sewage from the waste producing location
to the public sanitary sewer collection system.
   SINGLE SERVICE RESTAURANT. A restaurant where the meals are served on
throwaway plates and utensils.
   STANDARD RESTAURANT. A restaurant where meals are served on plates and
utensils that are washed and reused.
   UNDER THE SINK' GREASE TRAP. A device placed under or in close proximity to
sinks or other facilities likely to discharge grease in an attempt to separate,
trap or hold, oil and grease substances to prevent their entry into the
sanitary sewer collection system. GREASE TRAPS are commonly referred to based
on their grease retention capacity (i.e., 20#, 30#, 40# and the like).
   USER. A city customer operating a food service facility inside the city's
wastewater service area.
   WASTE. The liquid- and water-carried domestic or industrial wastes from
dwellings, commercial establishments, industrial facilities and institutions,
whether treated or untreated. WASTES may include but not limited to, discharges
from scullery sinks, pot and pan sinks, dishwashing machines, soup kettles and
floor drains located in areas where grease-containing material may exist. The
terms "sewage" and "wastewater" shall be deemed as WASTE by definition.
§ 18-303 GENERAL CRITERIA.
   (A)   Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All
proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the city's
wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly
operated and maintained grease interceptor.
   (B)   Phased implementation plan for existing food service facilities. All
existing food service facilities inside the city's wastewater service area are
expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured
on the user's premises and then properly disposed of. Existing food service
facilities will typically be handled under the city's grease control program.
      (1)   The city will periodically inspect each food service facility
annually or on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying
with the intent of the grease control program. The city's goal is to achieve
compliance by all existing food service facilities by 1-1-2007.
      (2)   Through preventive maintenance records or emergency calls related
to grease, the city will identify and target "grease problem areas" in the
waste waster collection system. Food service facilities located upstream of
these problem areas and discharge their waste water into the "problem" lines
will be identified as potential contributors to the grease build-up. The city
inspects the grease interceptors of all food service facilities in the vicinity
of the problem area, making note of maintenance records, sizing and condition.
      (3)   Each food service facility in the vicinity of the problem area will
be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of
their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance
records will also be reviewed.
      (4)   Following the inspections, the city will send written notice to the
inspected food service facilities, containing an educational brochure on grease
in the sewer system, a summary of the policy requirements, and results of the
inspection. The inspection will typically result in one of the following
actions.
         (a)   Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately-sized
grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease control program
through effective grease control practices will be commended for their
compliance.
         (b)   Facilities may be required to develop and submit to the city a
proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and
increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment.
         (c)   Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with
the intent of the grease control program through improved housekeeping and
increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment
will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the
facility into compliance. An appropriate amount of time will be agreed upon
between the city and the customer.
   (C)   Prohibited discharges. Black water shall not be discharged to the
grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the city.
   (D)   Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential
to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor.
   (E)   Garbage grinders and dishwashers. The city recommends that solid food
waste products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal
procedures. The use of garbage grinders which discharge to the sanitary sewer
is discouraged within the city wastewater service area, but in the event that
the device is used in a commercial or industrial facility, it must be connected
to the grease interceptor. The use of a garbage grinder decreases the
operational capacity of the grease interceptor and will require an increased
pumping frequency to ensure continuous and effective operation. Commercial
dishwasher connections must be connected to the grease interceptor. Food
particles from garbage grinders take up storage capacity in the grease
interceptor and will require that the interceptor be pumped more frequently.
Dishwashers discharge hot water and soap, which can melt grease stored in an
overburdened interceptor. Melted grease may then pass through the interceptor
into the customer's service line and the public sewer system, where the grease
hardens and causes line clogs.
      (1)   Although not recommended, existing food service facilities may
allow any fixtures to remain connected to a grease interceptor, except fixtures
which may discharge black water.
      (2)   Proposed and remodeled food service facilities may not connect
janitor sinks or black water fixtures to a grease interceptor.
   (F)   Location.
      (1)   Each grease trap and grease interceptor shall be installed and
connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal
of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease interceptor may not be
installed in any part of a building unless approved in writing by the city.
      (2)   Location of grease interceptors shall meet the approval of the
city. The best location is in an area outside of an outside wall, but upstream
from the black water drain line(s).
§ 18-304 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Construction of interceptor. Grease interceptors shall be constructed
in accordance with the city's standards and shall have a minimum of two
compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All grease removal
devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the city.
The approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the
proposed technology. The city's standard drawing for grease interceptors is
shown in Appendix A.
   (B)   Access. Access to grease traps and grease interceptors shall be
available at all times, to allow for their maintenance and inspection. Access
to grease interceptors shall be provided by two manholes terminating one inch
above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover.
   (C)   Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing
capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas).
   (D)   Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to a grease trap or
grease interceptor shall enter through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. Each
grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
   (E)   Interceptor sizing.
      (1)   The required size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by
using the city's grease interceptor sizing formula shown in Appendix B. Most
grease interceptors will have a capacity of not less than 1,000 gallons nor
exceed a capacity of 2,000 gallons. If the calculated capacity using the city's
grease interceptor sizing formula exceeds 2,000 gallons, multiple units in
series shall be installed. See Appendix B for example for formula.
      (2)   Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal
usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for
which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional
measures if required by the city. The city reserves the right to evaluate
interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special
conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge or
other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
Editor's note:
   Appendix A is available in the office of the City Clerk.
§ 18-305 GREASE TRAP AND INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Cleaning/pumping. The user at the user's expense shall maintain all
grease traps and interceptors. Maintenance of "under the sink" grease traps
shall include the removal of all fats, oil and grease from the detention
compartment of the trap. Removal is usually accomplished by hand-dipping or
scooping the collected grease from the trap. Maintenance of grease interceptors
shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating
materials, wastewater and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging
of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or
any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be
disposed, is prohibited.
   (B)   Cleaning/pumping frequency. "Under the sink" grease traps must be
cleaned no less than weekly. If grease traps are more than 50% full when
cleaned weekly, the frequency shall be increased. Grease interceptors must be
pumped out completely a minimum of once every 90 days, or more frequently as
needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection
system, unless it can be demonstrated to the city that the pumping frequency
can be extended past the 90-day period.
   (C)   Disposal of grease interceptor waste. All waste removed from each
grease interceptor must be disposed of at a facility approved by the city to
receive the waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way
shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary
sewer collection system.
   (D)   Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or
building discharge line system on a constant, regular or scheduled basis shall

(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
§ 18-414 INSTALLATION CRITERIA.
   The minimum acceptable criteria for the installation of reduced pressure
backflow prevention devices, double check valve assemblies or other backflow
prevention devices requiring regular inspection or testing shall include the
following.
   (A)   All required devices shall be installed in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, by a person approved by the water system who is
knowledgeable in the proper installation. Only licensed sprinkler contractors
may install, repair or test backflow prevention devices on fire protection
systems.
   (B)   An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each
service line to a customer's premises and in all cases, before the first branch
line leading off the service line, if it is impractical or easily altered to
provide an effective air gap separation, when any of the following conditions
exist.
   (C)   All devices shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions and shall possess appropriate test cocks, fittings and caps
required for the testing of the device (except hose bibb vacuum breakers). All
fittings shall be of brass construction, unless otherwise approved by the water
system, and shall permit direct connection to department test equipment.
   (D)   The entire device, including valves and test cocks, shall be easily
accessible for testing and repair.
   (E)   All devices shall be placed in the upright position in a horizontal
run of pipe.
   (F)   Devices shall be protected from freezing, vandalism, mechanical abuse
and from any corrosive, sticky, greasy, abrasive or other damaging environment.
   (G)   (1)   Reduced pressure backflow prevention devices shall be located a
minimum of 12 inches, plus the nominal diameter of the device above either:
         (a)   The floor;
         (b)   The top of opening(s) in the enclosure; or
         (c)   Maximum flood level, whichever is higher.
      (2)   Maximum height above the floor surface shall not exceed 60 inches.
   (H)   Clearance from wall surfaces or other obstructions shall be at least
six inches. Devices located in non-removal enclosures shall have at least 24
inches of clearance on each side of the device for testing and repairs.
   (I)   Devices shall be positioned where a discharge from the relief port
will not create undesirable conditions. The relief port must never be plugged,
restricted or solidly piped to a drain.
   (J)   An approved air-gap shall separate the relief port from any drainage
system. An approved air-gap shall be at least twice the inside diameter of the
supply line, but never less than one inch.
   (K)   An approved strainer shall be installed immediately upstream of the
backflow prevention device, except in the case of a fire protection system.
   (L)   Devices shall be located in an area free from submergence or flood
potential, therefore never in a below grade pit or vault. All devices shall be
adequately supported to prevent sagging.
   (M)   Adequate drainage shall be provided for all devices. Reduced pressure
backflow prevention devices shall be drained to the outside whenever possible.
   (N)   Fire hydrant drains shall not be connected to the sewer, nor shall
fire hydrants be installed the that backflow/back-siphonage through the drain
may occur.
   (O)   Enclosures for outside installations shall meet the following
criteria.
      (1)   All enclosures for backflow prevention devices shall be as
manufactured by a AWWA approved company or an approved equal.
      (2)   For backflow prevention devices up to and including two inches, the
enclosure shall be constructed of adequate material to protect the device from
vandalism and freezing, and shall be approved by the water system. The complete
assembly, including valve stems and handwheels, shall be protected by being
inside the enclosure.
      (3)   To provide access for backflow prevention devices up to and
including two inches, the enclosures shall be completely removable. Access for
backflow prevention devices two and one-half inches and larger shall be
provided through a minimum of two access panels. The access panels shall be of
the same height as the enclosure and shall be completely removable. All access
panels shall be provided with built-in locks.
      (4)   The enclosure shall be mounted to a concrete pad as specified by
the manufacturer, but in no case less than four inches thick. The enclosure
shall be constructed, assembled and/or mounted in the a manner that it will
remain locked and secured to the pad even if any outside fasteners are removed.
All hardware and fasteners shall be constructed of 300 series stainless steel.
      (5)   Heating equipment, if required, shall be designed and furnished by
the manufacturer of the enclosure to maintain and interior temperature of +40°F
with an outside temperature of -30°F and a wind velocity of 115 mph.
   (P)   Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal
operations or the protection of life, property or equipment, duplicate backflow
prevention devices shall be provided to avoid the necessity of discontinuing
water service to test or repair the protective device. Where it is found that
only one device has been installed and the continuance of service is critical,
the water system shall notify, in writing, the occupant of the premises of
plans to interrupt water services and arrange for a mutually acceptable time to
test the device. In the cases, the utility may require the installation of a
duplicate device.
   (Q)   The utility shall require the occupant of the premises to keep any
backflow prevention devices working properly, and to make all indicated repairs
promptly. Repairs shall be made by qualified personnel acceptable to the water
system. Expense of the repairs shall be borne by the owner or occupant of the
premises. The failure to maintain a backflow prevention device in proper
working condition shall be grounds for discontinuance of water service to
premises. Likewise the removal, bypassing or alteration of a backflow
prevention device or the installation thereof, so as to render a device
ineffective shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall be grounds
for discontinuance of water service. Water service to the premises shall not be
restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated the conditions or
defects to the satisfaction of the water system.
(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
§ 18-415 TESTING OF DEVICES.
   Assemblies shall be tested at least once in a 12-month period (on or before
365 days from last test) by the water system by a qualified person possessing a
valid certification from the State Department of Environment and Conservation,
Division of Water Supply, for the testing of the devices. A record of this test
will be on file with the water system and a copy of the report will be supplied
to the customer. Water service shall not be disrupted to test a device without
the knowledge of the occupant of the premises. There will be no charge for
annual testing.
   (A)   If any test does not meet the minimum requirements set forth in the
approved testing procedure, the assembly is deemed failed and does not suffice
as an approved backflow prevention device. If conditions around the assembly do
not allow the assembly to be tested, the assembly fails the assembly
performance evaluation and is marked failed on the test report. (Examples would
include assembly is submerged, test cocks missing or plugged, relief valve
continually discharging.)
   (B)   Each location requiring an assembly will have a documented backflow
prevention assembly, if the assembly at the address cannot be identified or is
not the same, the water provider will be notified and a determination of which
assembly is used for protection of the water system. (All areas that need
protection will be listed by address and location along with the serial number
of the device.)
   (C)   Assemblies must be tested when installed and after every repair.
Backflow prevention assemblies on lawn irrigation systems must be tested when
assemblies are placed in service after winterization (to prevent testing just
prior to winterization). If lawn irrigation backflow assemblies are taken
removed to winterize the system, upon startup of the system, the assemblies
must be retested.
   (D)   Failure to maintain a backflow prevention assembly that is deemed
passed shall be grounds for discontinuance of water service. The removal,
bypassing or altering of a protective device or installation, without the
approval of the Cross Connection Control Coordinator or designee, thereof so as
to render a device ineffective shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of
water service. Water service to the premises shall not be restored until the
customer has corrected or eliminated the conditions or defects to the
satisfaction this chapter and the Cross Connection Control Coordinator or
designee.
   (E)   The water system shall require the occupant of the premises to keep
the backflow prevention assembly working properly and a status of passed.
Repairs shall be made by qualified personnel acceptable to the water system
within the time limits set forth by this chapter. Expense of the repairs shall
be borne by the owner or occupant of the premises. The failure to maintain a
backflow prevention assembly in proper working order and a status of passed
shall be grounds for discontinuance of water service.
   (F)   The backflow prevention assembly must be tested after every repair and
have a status of passed to be in compliance with this chapter.
   (G)   The Cross Connection Control Coordinator or designee shall have the
right to inspect and test any assemblies whenever it is deemed necessary. Water
service shall not be disrupted to the assembly without the knowledge of the
occupant of the premises.
   (H)   All performance evaluations must be performed with an annually
certified test kit.
(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
§ 18-416 NON-POTABLE SUPPLIES.
   (A)   The potable water supply made available to a premises served by the
public water system shall be protected from contamination as specified in the
provisions of this chapter. Any water pipe or outlet which could be used for
potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied by the potable water
system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner such as: WATER UNSAFE FOR
DRINKING.
   (B)   The minimum acceptable sign shall have black letters at least one inch
high located on a red background. Color coding of pipelines, in accordance with
(OSHA) Occupational Safety and Health Act guidelines, shall be required in
locations where in the judgment of the utility, the coding is necessary to
identify and protect the potable water supply.
(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
§ 18-417 STATEMENT REQUIRED.
   Any person whose premises are supplied with water from the public water
system, and who also has on the same premises a well or other separate source
of water supply, or who stores water in an uncovered or unsanitary storage
reservoir from which the water is circulated through a piping system, shall
file with the water system a statement of the non-existence of unapproved or
unauthorized cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses or
interconnections. The statements shall contain an agreement that no cross
connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses or interconnections will be permitted
upon the premises. The statements shall also include the location of all
additional water sources utilized on the premises and how they are used.
Maximum backflow protection shall be required on all public water sources
supplied to the premises.
(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
§ 18-418 PENALTY; DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SUPPLY.
   (A)   Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the
provisions of this chapter may be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to
a fine.
   (B)   Independent of and in addition to any fines or penalties imposed, the
manager will discontinue the public water supply service to any premises upon
which there is found to be a cross connection, auxiliary intake, bypass or
interconnection; and service shall not be restored until the cross connection,
auxiliary intake, bypass or interconnection or non-compliance with this chapter
has been eliminated, corrected or approved backflow protection is installed
within time limits set forth by this chapter.
(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
§ 18-419 PROVISION APPLICABLE.
   The requirements contained in this chapter shall apply to all premises
served by the water system and are hereby made part of the conditions required
to be met for the water system to provide water services to any premises. The
provisions of this chapter shall be rigidly enforced since it is essential for
the protection of the public water distribution system against the entrance of
contamination. Any person aggrieved by the action of the chapter is entitled to
a due process hearing upon timely request.
(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
§ 18-420 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter is found to conflict with any provision of
any other chapter, then the provision of this chapter shall control. That
should any part, or parts of this chapter be declared invalid for any reason,
no other part, or parts, of this chapter shall be affected thereby.
(Ord. 1297, passed 4-12-2011)
APPENDIX A: EQUIPMENT POSING SIGNIFICANT RISK OF CREATING CROSS CONNECTIONS
