audible or not, in order to detect any fire or other emergency which summons
the Fire Department.

the system has been triggered or activated.
   AUDIBLE OR VISUAL ANNUNCIATOR. An annunciator which gives alarm by means of
a bell, siren, buzzer, flashing light or similar sound- or light-producing
device when activated, which is mounted at some location which is clearly
visible when observed or clearly audible at a distance of 50 feet or more

directly with the Fire Department or indirectly through the use of an alarm
monitoring service or remote monitoring point.
   FALSE ALARM. An occasion that has resulted in a response by the Fire
Department to the activation of any alarm system because of malfunction,
mechanical or electrical defect, improper installation or improper operation or
procedure by any person and no actual fire or other emergency occurred
requiring an immediate or emergency response by Fire Department personnel. The
term FALSE ALARM does not include an alarm system activated as a result of: any
malfunction of equipment owned or operated by the telephone company or
resulting from the authorized servicing, testing, maintenance, adjustments,
alterations or installations of such alarm system; a power outage; or utility
construction; provided that, the respective permittee or authorized agent

owner does not choose to connect to the sewer mains constructed as part of the
a project, the property owner is not required to pay a connection fee until
such time as a connection is made.
      (4)   If a property owner is subject to the connection fee and desires to
connect to a sewer main constructed as part of the project, the connection fee
amount shall be paid entirely at the time a sewer connection permit is obtained
from the city by the property owner, or the property owner may pay 25% of such
connection fee and may sign a waiver for deferred payments of the remaining
balance of such cost, to be paid in five annual installments, together with
interest at a rate set by I.C.A. § 74A.4, computed to December 1 following with
the September payment of general taxes, and such property owner shall consent
in writing for the filing of such assessment cost with the County Auditor for
collection as provided in this section.
      (5)   Property owners may elect to pay the connection fee at any time,
although they do not desire to use the municipal sanitary sewer utility, until
such time as their private system is deemed to have failed.
      (6)   The connection fee for property owners connecting to a developer-
constructed sewer or previously constructed special assessment sewer shall be
$300, no matter where or when constructed.
      (7)   The property owner paying a connection fee will be responsible for
the cost of providing the service line from the house to the public main or
lateral stub out being constructed as part of the project.

      (1)   The fee shall be a minimum charge of $0.118 per gallon will be
placed on all septage wastes collected.
      (2)   All rates are based on and charged for a full truckload of waste,
unless the collection vehicle has a calibrated electronic volume meter approved
by the city’s Water Pollution Control Department. Vehicles with an electronic
volume meter shall either be charged by the gallon shown on the meter, plus a
$10 meter reading fee per load or a full tank load volume fee.
   (B)   Grease trap wastes.  
      (1)   The fee shall be a minimum charge of $0.135 per gallon will be
placed on all grease trap wastes collected from within the city and two times
the rate or $0.270 per gallon for disposal and treatment of grease trap wastes
collected outside the city.
      (2)   All rates are based on and charged for a full truckload of waste,
unless the collection vehicle has a calibrated electronic volume meter approved
by the city’s Water Pollution Control Department. Vehicles with an electronic
volume meter shall either be charged by the gallon shown on the meter, plus a
$10 meter reading fee per load or a full tank load volume fee.
      (2)   If grease trap waste is co-mingled with septage, the full load or
metered load will be charged at the higher rate for grease trap waste.
   (C)   Mudpit facility registration. Any owner of a mudpit wishing to dispose
of the mudpit waste at the city mudpit waste disposal facility shall pay a
registration fee of $100 per calendar year and shall provide cleaning of the
pit at least once per year.
   (D)   Mudpit waste. A minimum charge of $50 per vehicle load will be placed
on all mudpit wastes collected from within the city and an additional $25 per
cubic yard in excess of two yards per vehicle load. Mudpit wastes shall not be
accepted from outside the city limits.
   (E)   Other wastes. The Water Pollution Control Plant Superintendant may
accept other large volumes of trucked waste, if he or she feels the treatment
plant can handle the waste loading. The charge for such waste would be twice
the current rate charged per this chapter or as set by Council resolution, but
at no time less than $0.03 per gallon. The trucked waste discharger is
responsible for all costs associated with the sampling and testing of the waste
as required by the Director.

of a violation of the city’s NPDES permit or of the prevention of sewage sludge
use or disposal in compliance with any of the following statutory/regulatory
provisions or permits issued there under or more stringent state or local
regulations: § 405 of the Clean Water Act; the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA),
including Title II commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA); any state regulations contained in any state sludge
management plan prepared pursuant to subtitle D of the SWDA; the Clean Air Act;
the Toxic Substances Control Act; and the Marine Protection, Research and
Sanctuaries Act.
      NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM PERMIT or NPDES PERMIT. A
permit issued pursuant to § 402 of the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1342).
      NATIONAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD, PRETREATMENT STANDARD or STANDARD. Any
regulation containing pollutant discharge limits promulgated by the
Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with § 307(b) and (c) of the Act,
which applies to industrial users. This term includes prohibitive discharge
limits established pursuant to § 403.5 of the Act.
      NEW SOURCE.
         (a)   As follows:
            1.   Any building, structure, facility or installation from which
there is or may be a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which
commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under § 307
(c) of the Act which will be applicable to such source if such standards are
thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section; provided that:
               a.   The building, structure, facility or installation is
constructed at a site at which no other source is located;
               b.   The building, structure, facility or installation totally
replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of
pollutants at an existing source; or
               c.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the
building, structure, facility or installation are substantially independent of
an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source should
be considered.
            2.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a NEW SOURCE if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria
of divisions (a)1.a. or (a)1.b. above, but otherwise alters, replaces or adds
to existing process or production equipment.
         (b)   Construction of a NEW SOURCE has commenced if the owner or
operator has begun or caused to begin as part of a continuous on-site
construction program:
            1.   Any placement, assembly or installation of facilities or
equipment;
            2.   Significant site preparation work including cleaning,
excavation or removal of existing buildings, structures or facilities which is
necessary for the placement, assembly or installation of new source facilities
or equipment; or
            3.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase
of facilities or equipment that is intended to be used in its operation within
a reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss and contracts for feasibility, engineering
and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
definition.
      PASS THROUGH. A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United
States in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a
discharge from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any requirement of
the city’s NPDES permit, including an increase in the magnitude or duration of
a violation.
      PERSON. Any individual, partnership, co-partnership, firm, company,
corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, governmental
entity or any other legal entity, or their legal representatives, agents or
assigns. The masculine gender shall include the feminine. The singular shall
include the plural where indicated by the context.
      pH. The logarithm of the reciprocal of the weight of hydrogen ions in
grams per liter of solution and is a measurement of the intensity of the
acidity or alkalinity of the solution.
      POLLUTANT. Any dredged spoil; solid waste; incinerator residue; sewage;
garbage; sewage sludge; munitions; chemical wastes; biological materials;
radioactive materials; heat; wrecked or discarded equipment; rock; sand; cellar
dirt; and industrial, municipal and agricultural waste discharged into water.
      POLLUTION. The human-made or human-induced alteration of the chemical,
physical, biological and radiological integrity of water.
      POTW TREATMENT PLANT. The portion of the POTW designed to provide
treatment to wastewater.
      PRETREATMENT or TREATMENT. The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the
elimination of pollutants or the alteration of the nature of pollutants or the
alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in wastewater to a less
harmful state prior to or in lieu of discharging or otherwise introducing such
pollutants into a POTW. The reduction or alteration can be obtained by
physical, chemical or biological processes or process changes by other means,
except as prohibited by 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(d).
      PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS. Any substantive or procedural requirement
related to pretreatment, other than a national pretreatment standard imposed on
an industrial user.
      PUBLICLY-OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW). A treatment works as defined by §
212 of the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1292) that is owned in this instance by the city.
This definition includes any sewers that convey wastewater to the POTW
treatment plant, but does not include pipes, sewers or other conveyances not
connected to a facility providing treatment. For the purposes of this
subchapter, the acronym POTW shall also include any sewers that convey
wastewaters to the POTW from persons outside the city who are, by contract or
agreement with the city, users of the city’s POTW.
      SHALL. The act referred to is mandatory; MAY is permissive.
      SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USER or MAJOR CONTRIBUTING INDUSTRIES.
         (a)   Applies to the following:
            1.   Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards; and
            2.   Any other industrial user that:
               a.   Discharges an average of 25,000 gpd or more of process
wastewater;
               b.   Contributes a process waste stream which makes up 5% or
more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the treatment
plant; or
               c.   Is designated as significant by the city on the basis that
the industrial user has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the
POTW’s operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
         (b)   The control authority may decide to remove any non-categorical
industrial user from the list of SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS if the industrial
facility has no reasonable potential to violate any pretreatment standards
(general and specific prohibitions or local limits). The approval authority may
choose to review deletions and/or require additional facilities to be listed.
         (c)   The control authority may reduce oversight of certain industrial
users that may be reclassified as nonsignificant categorical industrial users
(NCSIUs) (40 C.F.R. §§ 403.3(v)(2), 403.8(f)(2)(v) and 403.12(e)(3)(i)).
Previously, all IUs falling under a federal-listed category were designated as
categorical industrial users (CIUs), no matter the size of the operations. The
amendment creates two additional classifications for CIUs:
            1.   Non-significant CIU: CIUs that consistently comply with
applicable pretreatment standards consistently discharge less than 100 gpd of
categorical wastewater, and never discharge any untreated concentrated
wastewater may be classified as non-significant CIU. This classification
reduces the monitoring requirements for an industry and does not require that
the facility have a pretreatment permit. However, they must continue to comply
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and provide annual
certification of compliance.
            2.   Middle tier CIU: CIUs which are:<0.01% of POTW’s design dry
weather hydraulic capacity or 5,000 gpd, whichever is smaller (measured by
continuous effluent flow monitoring) unless the CIU is a batch discharger;
0.015 of POTW’s design dry weather treatment capacity; and <0.01% of the
maximum allowable headworks loading (MAIL) for any local limits. To be eligible
for classification as a middle tier CIU, the CIU must not have been in SNC for
any time in the previous two years and the daily flow rates, production levels,
or pollutant levels cannot vary significantly whereby reduced reporting would
not be representative of operating conditions. Adoption of these
classifications allows for reduced monitoring and regulatory burden for CIUs
with very low flows and potential to impact the POTW.
      SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE.
         (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits,
as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(1);
         (b)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of
the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous
limits, as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC
(TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants,
except pH);
         (c)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
         (d)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in
the POTW’s exercise of its emergency authority hereunder to halt or prevent
such a discharge;
         (e)   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or
attaining final compliance;
         (f)   Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
         (g)   Failure to accurately report non-compliance; and
         (h)   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
      SLUG LOAD. Any pollutant, including BOD, released in a discharge at a
flow rate or concentration sufficient to cause a violation of the specific
discharge prohibitions in 40 C.F.R. §§ 403.5(b) to 403.12(f).
      STANDARD INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION (SIC). A classification pursuant to
the Standard Industrial Classification Manual issued by the Executive Office of
the President, Office of Management and Budget, 1972.
      STORM WATER. Any flow occurring during or following any form of natural
precipitation and resulting therefrom.
      SUSPENDED SOLIDS. The total suspended matter that floats on the surface
of or is suspended in water, wastewater or other liquids and which is removable
by laboratory filtering.

52.999
§ 52.073 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES (SLUG LOADS); PLANS.
   (A)   (1)   Generally. Each user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
subchapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or user’s own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by
the city before construction of the facility and each user shall verify the
status of the slug control plan for any renewal cycle. No user who commences
contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which
this subchapter derives shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the
system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this subchapter. If an accidental
discharge (slug load) occurs, it is the responsibility of the user to
immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification
shall include location of the discharge, the type of waste, the concentration
and volume and corrective actions.
      (2)   Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge,
the user shall submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. No such notification shall relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor
shall such notification relieve the use of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this subchapter or other applicable law.
      (3)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
if a slug or accidental discharge occurs. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(2013 Code, § 28-84)
   (B)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the Director may require any
industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control
plan. At least once every two years, the Director shall evaluate whether each
significant industrial user needs a plan. Any industrial user required to
develop and implement an accidental discharge/control slug plan shall submit a
plan that addresses, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge that
would violate any of the prohibited discharges in §
52.067 of this chapter;
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants including solvents and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response
      (5)   Industrial users are required to notify the Director immediately of
any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

to meet applicable pretreatment standards.
      (2)   If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the
pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide
such additional pretreatment shall be established. The completion date in this
schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the
applicable pretreatment standard. (See §
52.077 of this chapter.) The following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing a contract for
major components, commencing construction, completing construction and the
like);
         (b)   No increment referred to in division (B)(2)(a) above shall
exceed nine months, nor shall the total compliance period exceed 18 months;
         (c)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
Director including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to
the Director;
         (d)   Each product produced by type, amount, process and rate of
production;
         (e)   Type and amount of raw materials processed, average and maximum
per day;
         (f)   Number and type of employees and hours of operation of the plant
and proposed or actual hours of operation of the pretreatment system; and
         (g)   Any other information as may be deemed by the city to be
necessary to evaluate the permit application.
      (3)   All plans required in this division (B) must be certified for
accuracy by a state-registered professional engineer.
      (4)   The city will evaluate the data furnished by the user and any
required additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data
furnished, the city may issue a wastewater contribution permit subject to terms
and conditions provided in this subchapter.
   (C)   Permit modification.
      (1)   This permit may be modified for good cause, including, but not
limited to, the following:
         (a)   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
         (b)   Material or substantial alterations or additions to the
discharger’s operation processes or discharge volume or character which were
not considered in drafting the effective permit;
         (c)   A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the
POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of
the authorized discharge;
         (d)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a
threat to the control authority’s collection and treatment systems, POTW
personnel or the receiving waters;
         (e)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit;
         (f)   Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant
facts in the permit application or in any required reporting;
         (g)   To correct typographical or other errors in the permit;
         (h)   To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation
to a new owner/operator; and
         (i)   Upon request of the permittee; provided, such request does not
create a violation of any applicable requirements, standards, laws or rules and
regulations.
      (2)   Under promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard,
the wastewater contribution permit of users subject to such standards shall be
revised to require compliance with such standard within the time frame
prescribed by such standard. Where a user, subject to a national categorical
pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application for a
wastewater contribution permit as required by division (B) above, the user
shall apply for a wastewater contribution permit within 90 days after the
promulgation of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. In
addition, the user with an existing wastewater contribution permit shall submit
to the Director, within 90 days after the promulgation of an applicable federal
categorical pretreatment standard, the information required hereby.
   (D)   Permit conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this subchapter and all other applicable
regulations, user charges and fees established by the city. Permits may contain
the following as determined by the Director:
      (1)   Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
      (2)   Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or
requirements for flow regulations and equalization;
      (3)   Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and

thereto. Industrial users must keep records of monitoring activities and
results for a minimum of three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this
subchapter or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the Director and/or approval authority;
      (8)   Requirements for notification of the city of any new introduction
of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character
of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater treatment
system;
      (9)   Requirements for notification of slug discharges as per §
52.073(A) of this chapter; and
      (10)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to ensure
compliance with this subchapter.
   (E)   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period,
not to exceed three years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a year
or may be stated to expire on a specific day. The user shall apply for permit
reissuance a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing
permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification
by the city during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements, as
identified in §§
52.067 through
52.073 of this chapter, are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall
be informed of any proposed changes in his or her permit at least 30 days prior
to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the
permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   (F)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be
reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises
or a new or changed operation without the approval of the city. Any succeeding
owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing
permit.
   (G)   Report of changed conditions.
      (1)   Each industrial user is required to notify the Director of any
planned significant changes to the industrial user’s operations or system that
might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days
before the change in accordance with the following.
         (a)   The Director may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
division (B) above.
         (b)   The Director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
division (A) above or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
division (C) above.
      (2)   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions
until and unless the Director has responded to the industrial user’s notice.
      (3)   For purposes of this division (G), flow increases of 10% or greater
and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be deemed
significant.
(2013 Code, § 28-88) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.077 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   General pretreatment regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 403.12 set forth five
basic reporting requirements that apply to industrial users subject to specific
categorical pretreatment standards. Categorical industrial users must comply
with these federal reporting requirements, even if the control authority has
determined that the local limit requirement is more stringent than the
categorical standard. These requirements are as follows.
      (1)   Baseline monitoring report (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)). A baseline
monitoring report is required, including a compliance schedule, when necessary,
for meeting categorical standards (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(c)). Within either 180
days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or the
final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 C.F.R. §
403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing significant industrial users subject
to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be required to submit to the Director
a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)1-7. At
least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources and sources
that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard shall be required to submit to the Director a report which
contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)1-7. A new source shall
also be required to report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of
its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.
      (2)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(d)). Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in
the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the user facility, which are limited by such pretreatment
standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user
into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements.
This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user, and certified by a qualified professional.
      (3)   Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards.
(See §
52.076 of this chapter.) The Director may impose mass limitations on users
which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by division (A)(1) above shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where requested by the Director of pollutants contained
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standards.
      (4)   Periodic report on continued compliance (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e)).
Categorical and non- categorical industrial users are required to report on
their regulated waste discharges to the control authority at least
semiannually. The regulations (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e)(1)) state that the reports
are to contain information indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent that are limited by such categorical pretreatment
standards. For some categorical TTO standards, the categorical regulation
provides for the use of a certification as a substitute for sampling and
analysis results. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured
or estimated average daily flows for the reporting period. If the city performs
all of the monitoring and sampling requirements of the industrial user’s permit
every six months, the city will send all permitted industrial users a standard
six-month compliance form for the industrial user to certify compliance.
      (5)   Signatory requirements. All wastewater discharge permit
applications and industrial user reports must contain the following
certification statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user: “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine for knowing violations.”
      (6)   Notice of slug loading (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(f)). (See §
52.073(A) of this chapter.) All industrial users must notify the control
authority immediately of any slug loading. SLUG LOADING is defined as any
pollutant, including biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), released in a discharge
at a flow rate or concentration which will cause interference with the
operation of the treatment works.
      (7)   Notification of discharge of hazardous waste. Any industrial user
who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the
Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director,
and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under
40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the Environmental Protection Agency
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous batch or other).
If the industrial user discharges more than ten kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained
in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and an estimation of
the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180
days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this division (A)(7)
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under §
52.076 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this division (A)(7)
does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring
requirements.
   (B)   (1)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A)
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms
of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified
in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
      (2)   If any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identify additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or list any additional substance as a
hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the Environmental
Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations. For any notification made under this
division (B), the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place
to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree
it has determined to be economically practical.
(2013 Code, § 28-89) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993; Ord. 14970, passed 11-27-
2017)
§ 52.078 ANALYSES.
   All analyses required under this subchapter shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to § 304(g) of the
Act and contained in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments. Where 40 C.F.R. part
136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Environmental Protection Agency publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator.
(2013 Code, § 28-90) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.079 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The city may require an industrial user of the POTW to provide and
operate, at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s
premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that landscaping or parked vehicles will
not obstruct it.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.
(2013 Code, § 28-91) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.080 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this subchapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination/copying or in the performance of any of their
duties. The city, approval authority and Environmental Protection Agency shall
have the right to set up on the user’s property such devices as are necessary
to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval
authority and Environmental Protection Agency will be permitted to enter,
without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
Sampling of an industrial user’s wastewater shall be required at least
semiannually (once every six months). The POTW may choose to monitor in lieu of
requiring the industrial user to perform the self-monitoring. If sampling
conducted by the industrial user indicates a violation, the user must repeat
the sampling and submit analytical results within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation. If the industrial user performed the initial sampling, the
user must notify the POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation in
addition to performing the follow-up sampling and analysis. Industrial users
that are identified as “significant” are required to report all monitoring
results to the POTW.
   (B)   In cases of violation where the POTW has assumed responsibility for
sampling in lieu of the industrial user, the POTW must repeat the sampling and
analysis. An exception of that requirement is made if the POTW performs the
sampling at the facility at a frequency of at least once a month or if the POTW
performs sampling at the industrial user between the time of the initial
sampling and the receipt of the results of that sampling.
   (C)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-
hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composited
sampling techniques, unless the POTW authorized time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling. Where the POTW authorizes time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling, the samples must be representative of the
discharge, and the justification for the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the IU’s file for that facility or facilities.
When grab samples are determined to be applicable for representative sampling
under certain circumstances, the POTW shall determine and document the number
of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
limits.
(2013 Code, § 28-92) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993; Ord. 14969, passed 9-25-
2017)
§ 52.081 PRETREATMENT.
   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply
with this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal
pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be
acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this subchapter. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.
(2013 Code, § 28-93) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.082 RECORDKEEPING.
   Industrial users shall retain and make available for inspection and copying
all records and information required to be retained under this subchapter.
These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning compliance with this subchapter or where the industrial user has
been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director and/or
approval authority.
(2013 Code, § 28-94) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.083 PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE.
   The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in
the city, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous 12 months,
were in significant non-compliance with any standard or requirement of this
subchapter. (See §
52.066 of this chapter, defining the term “significant non-compliance”.)
(2013 Code, § 28-95) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.084 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and
monitoring programs and from city inspection and sampling activities pursuant
to this subchapter shall be available to the public without restriction unless
the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the
industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of the report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for
uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 2.302
will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.
(2013 Code, § 28-96) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.085 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   Under this subchapter, the Director may immediately suspend a
user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The Director may also immediately suspend
a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director shall take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Director shall allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings set forth in division (B) below are initiated against the user.
      (3)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the Director, prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under divisions (B) and (D) below. Nothing in this
section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this section.
   (B)   Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the following conditions
of this subchapter or applicable state and federal regulation is subject to
having his or her permit revoked in accordance with the procedure of this
section:
      (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of his or her discharge;
      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring;
      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit;
      (5)   Supplying any false information or statement, representation or
certification in any application, report, plan or other document filed or
required to be maintained pursuant to this subchapter; or
      (6)   Violation of any of the provisions and/or requirements of this
subchapter.
   (C)   Notification of violation; compliance scheduling.
      (1)   Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating
this subchapter, wastewater contribution permit or any prohibition, limitation
or requirements contained in this subchapter, the water pollution control plant
shall serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the
violation. The notification shall require the industry to reply to the city in
writing, within ten days of notification, the cause for the violation and the
action the industry plans to take to achieve compliance. A notice of violation
to an industry in significant non-compliance shall require the industry to
submit a compliance schedule to the city within 30 days of notification. The
Director may require a compliance schedule be required as part of the notice of
violation if any single violation warrants immediate action. Whenever discharge
permit renewals or reports are not submitted as required, a notice of violation
shall be issued requiring submission within seven days of notification.
      (2)   Any industry found in significant non-compliance of its discharge
permit or any single violation of an industrial permit or pretreatment
ordinance provision deemed significant by the Director shall within 30 days of
notification submit to the city a schedule of compliance to correct the
violation. Any plan for corrective action submitted after notification shall
include a timetable for completion of the required tasks. The plan must be
approved and accepted by the city and will represent an agreement which will
allow any available enforcement procedure to apply. Any schedule of compliance
that exceeds 60 days shall be submitted to the district courts for purposes of
a court order approving the compliance schedule making it enforceable against
each party thereto as a court order.
   (D)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The city may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized
discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the City Council why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City
Council regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show cause before the
City Council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The City Council shall itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence.
      (3)   After the City Council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service will be discontinued. If the user
certifies that proper modifications have been made to meet discharge
requirements, the sewer disconnect order may be cancelled. Further orders and
directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
   (E)   Legal action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or
other wastes into the city’s wastewater disposal system contrary to the
provisions of this subchapter, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or
any order of the city, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate
legal and/or equitable relief in the District Court of the county.
(2013 Code, § 28-97) (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 52.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.999 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of §§
52.020 through
52.031 of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be liable for any damages done
to the sanitary sewer system or the water pollution control plant and shall be
punished by a civil penalty as provided in §
10.999(A) of this code of ordinances. Each day that a violation continues may
be considered a separate violation.
(2013 Code, § 28-53)
   (C)   (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates or resists the
enforcement of any provision of §§
52.045 through
52.051 of this chapter shall be guilty of a municipal infraction, punishable as
provided in §
10.999(A) of this code of ordinances. Each violation constitutes a separate
offense. Any person, firm or corporation who violates a provision of §§
52.045 through
52.051 of this chapter after previously being found guilty of violating the
same provision of §§
52.045 through
52.051 of this chapter at the same location or at a different location shall be
guilty of a repeat offense.
      (2)   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this division (C) does not
preclude the city from seeking alternative relief, including injunctive relief,
suits for monetary damages or enforcement provisions under the city’s
Industrial Pretreatment Ordinance.
(2013 Code, § 28-69)
   (D)   (1)   Judicial enforcement remedies.
         (a)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued under §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter or any other pretreatment requirement, the Director may
petition the courts through the city’s Attorney for the issuance of a temporary
or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter on activities of the industrial user. Such other action
as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the
city. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to
taking any other action against a user.
         (b)   Civil penalties. Civil penalties, including municipal
infractions pursuant to city ordinance (see I.C.A. § 364.22), may be imposed as
follows.
            1.   Any industrial user who violates any pretreatment standard or
requirement, as referred to in 40 C.F.R. § 403.8, may be punished by a civil
penalty of not more than $1,000 for each day a violation exists or continues.
            2.   Any user who commits any environmental violation of I.C.A. Ch.
455B or a violation of a standard established by the city in consultation with
the state’s Department of Natural Resources, or both, may be punished by a
civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each occurrence.
            3.   A person committing an environmental violation is not subject
to a civil penalty, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
               a.   The violation results solely from the person conducting an
initial startup, cleaning, repairing, performing scheduled maintenance, testing
or conducting a shutdown of either equipment causing the violation or the
equipment designed to reduce or eliminate the violation;
               b.   The person notifies the city of the violation within 24
hours from the time that the violation begins; and
               c.   The violation does not continue in existence for more than
eight hours. The city shall not enforce this division (D)(1)(b) against a
person committing an environmental violation until the city offers to
participate in informal negotiations with the person. If the person accepts the
offer, the city and the person shall participate in good faith negotiations to
resolve issues alleged to be the basis of the violation.
            4.   The Director may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
            5.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice
requires.
            6.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite
for taking any other action against a user.
            7.   Violation of §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter shall, in addition hereto, be a municipal infraction.
         (c)   Criminal prosecution. Any person who violates any provision of
§§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter shall, in addition to the civil penalties in this
division (D), upon conviction, be punished by a penalty as provided in §
10.999 of this code of ordinances.
         (d)   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter or the wastewater contribution permit or who falsifies,
tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a penalty as
provided in §
10.999 of this code of ordinances.
         (e)   Remedies non-exclusive. The provisions in this section are not
exclusive remedies. Additional remedies shall include, but not be limited to,
injunctive relief, suits for monetary damage and suits for court orders
directing compliance. The city reserves the right to take any, all or any
combination of these actions against a non-compliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s
enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any non-compliant
user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
(2013 Code, § 28-98)
      (2)   Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
         (a)   Upset. Upset used as an affirmative defense to a discharge
violation under §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter shall be in accordance with the following.
            1.   For the purposes of this division (D)(2), the term UPSET means
an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary non-
compliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond
the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include non-
compliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance or careless or improper operation.
            2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for non- compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements hereof are met.
            3.   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative
defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:
               a.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
cause of the upset;
               b.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
               c.   The industrial user has submitted the following information
to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the upset; if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days:
                  i.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
non-compliance;
                  ii.   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected
to continue; and
                  iii.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate
and prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
            4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
            5.   Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
            6.   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges
to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
division (D)(2)(a)6. applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
         (b)   General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for non-
compliance with the general and specific prohibitions in §§
52.067 and
52.068 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to
know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
            1.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during
the pass through or interference; or
            2.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the city WPCP was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and, in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
         (c)   Bypass. Bypass used as an affirmative defense to a discharge
violation under §§
52.065 through
52.085 of this chapter shall be in accordance with the following:
            1.   For the purpose of this division (B), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
               BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a industrial user’s treatment facility.
               SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
            2.   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of divisions (D)(2)(c)3. and (D)(2)(c)4.
below.
            3.   Notice of bypass shall be submitted as follows.
               a.   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW at least ten days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
               b.   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain: a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times; and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent occurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
            4.   Enforcement actions and approval of an anticipated bypass
shall be as follows.
               a.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement
action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
                  i.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury or severe property damage;
                  ii.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such
as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
                  iii.   The industrial user submitted notices as required
hereunder.
               b.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the
three conditions listed in division (D)(2)(c)4.a. above.

(2013 Code, § 28-124) (Ord. 14918, passed 4-22-2013)
§ 53.006 RATE STRUCTURE AND STORM WATER RATE.
   (A)   Any property, lot, parcel of land, building or premises that is
tributary directly or indirectly to the storm water system of the city, shall
be subject to a rate based upon the quantity of impervious area situated
thereon. This charge is not related to the water and/or sewer service and does
not rely on occupancy of the premises to be in effect. All properties having
impervious area of at least 150 square feet within the corporate limits of the
city will be assigned the rate.
   (B)   A unit of impervious surface area on an average single-family,
residential property or equivalent residential unit (ERU) is the quantity used
for assessing storm water charges. One ERU equals 2,800 square feet of
impervious area for the city.
   (C)   The Storm Water Utility charge is calculated based on the following
method.
      (1)   Single-family residential customers and duplexes with gross
property area less or equal to two acres will be assigned one ERU and assessed
a storm water charge that is equivalent to one ERU unit rate per month.
      (2)   All other developed properties shall be assigned a number of ERUs
based upon the property's individually measured impervious area (in square
feet) divided by one ERU, or 2,800 square feet, and rounding up to the nearest
integer. The monthly storm water charge assessed to each of these properties is
the number of ERUs times the ERU unit rate.
      (3)   Storm water charges for residential customers with gross property
area greater than two acres or non-residential developments shall be based on
measurements of impervious areas.
   (D)   Impervious area measurements shall be maintained by the city's
Engineering Department for all residential customers with parcels greater than
two acres and non-residential customers to determine their share of the storm
water management costs. In no event shall any owner specified herein pay less
than the rate required for one ERU per month. As part of the building permit
process, property owners shall coordinate with the city's Building Inspection
and Engineering staff to ensure that, as impervious areas change on the owner's
property due to construction or demolition, the Engineering Department
maintains up to date records of impervious areas for use in determining
property storm water utility billing.
   (E)   Commencing on July 1, 2024, and continuing thereafter, the monthly
unit rate shall be $4.20 per equivalent residential unit (ERU).

   (A)   A storm water service charge bill may be sent through the United
States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of
the bill, the date the payment is due and the date when past due. Failure to
receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to
whom the bill is initially directed, liability for payment of the storm water
management charge attributable to that property shall be joint and several as
to the owner and occupant.
   (B)   All comprehensive storm water service charges are due and payable 30
days after the date of billing.
   (C)   A penalty of 5% shall be added to a comprehensive storm water service
charge when the charge is not paid per Marshalltown Water Works procedure. Each
storm water service charge rendered under or pursuant to this chapter is hereby
made a lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or premises
that are tributary directly or indirectly to the storm water system of the city
and, if the same is not paid pursuant to the notice, it shall be certified to
the County Treasurer, who shall place a lien on said property as allowed by law
and be collected in the same manner as property taxes.
   (D)   (1)   The Storm Water Utility charges in this chapter shall constitute
a lien upon the premises served by the storm water management and drainage
system utility.
      (2)   The Marshalltown Water Works will compile a list of all storm water
utility charges that have remained unpaid and delinquent with the name of the
owner and the legal description of the property or premises for each separate
bill, and this list may be certified to the County Treasurer by the Board of
Water Works Trustees for collection in the same manner as taxes, and when so
collected the proceeds shall become a part of the Storm Water Utility Fund of
the city.
      (3)   Failure to send or receive a bill for comprehensive storm water
service charge is not a defense to the collection of the service charges.
   (E)   Suits for collection shall be commenced by the city in the state’s
District Court for the county. No lien shall be imposed for delinquent
collections unless a judgment is first obtained from a court of competent
jurisdiction. The city may employ any lawful means to collect funds owed and is
not restricted to filing a lawsuit.
   (F)   The Storm Water Utility service charge may be billed on a common
statement and collected along with other city utility services.
   (G)   The State of Iowa Offset Program may also be utilized by the
Marshalltown Water Works for collection of delinquent storm water utility
accounts that are not eligible for a lien.
   (H)   The City Clerk reserves the right to process collection procedures
through the city.

§ 54.008 SUSPENSION OF ACCESS TO CITY’S STORM SEWER SYSTEM.
   (A)   Emergency suspension. The Enforcement Officer may, without prior
notice, suspend storm sewer system access to a property when such emergency
suspension is necessary to stop an ongoing or imminent illicit discharge. If
the responsible party fails to immediately comply with an emergency suspension
order, the Enforcement Officer shall take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize the illicit discharge. All costs of such action shall be
recovered from the responsible party for the property identified as the source
of the illicit discharge.
   (B)   Non-emergency suspension. If the Enforcement Officer detects or is
informed of circumstances which could cause an illicit discharge, but such
illicit discharge is not ongoing or imminent, and if the suspension of storm
sewer system access would reasonably be expected to prevent or reduce the
potential illicit discharge, the Enforcement Officer shall notify the
responsible party of the proposed suspension of storm sewer system access and
the time and date of such suspension. Notice to one responsible party for the
property shall be sufficient notice to all. Remediation of the circumstances
shall avoid a violation of this chapter; provided that, no illicit discharge
occurs. In the alternative, the responsible party may request a meeting with
the Enforcement Officer for the purpose of presenting information which the
responsible party believes will show that remediation is unnecessary and, if
the Enforcement Officer finds such information is satisfactory, the Enforcement
Officer may rescind or modify the notice of suspension. If the Enforcement
Officer finds such information unsatisfactory, the Enforcement Officer shall
issue a final written order of suspension including the date and time of
suspension and such order may be appealed as provided in this chapter. Any
physical action to reinstate storm sewer system access to property subject to
such order prior to obtaining a court order of relief shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter. An order of suspension shall not preclude charging
the responsible party with a municipal infraction as provided hereinafter or
taking any other enforcement action permitted by law.

§ 55.001 GENERAL.
   (A)   Soil erosion contributes to the impairment of drainageways, increases
road and storm sewer maintenance costs, contributes to the destruction and
obstruction to traveled roadways creating a potential hazard for vehicular
traffic, and contributes to contamination and degradation of land surfaces and
streams, flooding and dusty conditions. This chapter establishes requirements
in an effort to control erosion and sediment transport.
   (B)   Owners of certain construction sites are required, under rules
contained in General Permit No. 2, Storm Water Discharge Associated with
Industrial Activity for Construction Activities (“General Permit No. 2”), to
obtain coverage through the state’s DNR under that permit.
   (C)   Under its Municipal Storm Water National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System permit, which permit is on file at the offices of the City
Clerk and the City Engineer and is available for public inspection during
regular office hours, the city is required to regulate, treat and control storm
water discharges into the city’s storm water drainage system. One provision of
that permit requires the city to enforce the requirements of General Permit No.
2 jointly with the state’s DNR.
   (D)   General Permit No. 2 and the document entitled Summary Guidance, A
Brief Guide to Developing Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management
Practices, issued and administered by the state’s DNR, are hereby adopted and
by reference made part of this section as if fully set forth herein. Any act
these documents require or prohibit, is required or prohibited by this section.
Any future amendments, revisions or modifications to these documents,
incorporated herein, are intended to be made a part of this section.
   (E)   This chapter also establishes requirements for grading, filling, fill
material and for obtaining erosion control permits. These requirements include
use of suitable fill material, stable slope construction, proper site drainage
and usability of public and private easements.
   (F)   Except as provided in §
55.004 of this chapter, no person shall engage in land-disturbing activities
within the city unless they have received an erosion control permit from the
city.

§ 56.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Marshalltown Post-Construction Storm
Water Management Ordinance” and may be cited as such and will be referred to
herein as “this chapter”.
(2013 Code, § 28-201) (Ord. 14853, passed 2-23-2009)
§ 56.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit program administered by the state’s Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and environmental
impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the discharge of storm
water from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) (MS4 permit). The city
is subject to the program and is required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4
permit. The city’s MS4 permit is on file at the office of the City Clerk and is
available for public inspection during regular office hours.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to comply with the MS4 permit
requirements and establish a set of water quality and quantity policies
applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the
regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation. The regulation of storm water runoff discharged
from land development and other construction activities in order to control and
minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion,
stream channel erosion and non-point source pollution associated with storm
water runoff, is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public
health and safety.

directed to the person or persons keeping, sheltering or harboring the vicious
animal and shall be served in the manner of personal service under the Iowa
Rules of Civil Procedure, or by both regular and certified mail and shall be
effective upon placement of the notice in a United States Post Office
receptacle. The notice shall also advise the persons to whom it is directed of
their right to appeal the order by delivering to the City Clerk within three
days of the personal service or five days of the mailing by regular and
certified mail, a written notice of appeal which provides the names and
addresses of the owners of the vicious animal, names the vicious animal and
states the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Within seven days of
receiving a notice of appeal hereunder, the City Clerk shall send by regular
mail to the appellant(s) at the address provided in the notice of appeal, a
written notice of the time, date and place for the hearing, the name of the

utility companies operating within the city; provided, mutually satisfactory
rental agreements can be reached. It is the grantor’s desire that all holders

erected by the grantee in the city shall be located so as not to endanger or
interfere with the normal use of streets, alleys or other public ways and
places so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable
convenience of the general public and adjoining property owners and so as not

conduits or other fixtures aboveground or belowground where the poles, conduits
or other fixtures shall interfere with any prior placement of gas, electric,

conduits or other fixtures aboveground or belowground shall be so placed as to
comply with all the requirements of the grantor.
   (G)   Moving permits. The grantee shall, on request of any person holding a
moving permit issued by the grantor, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to

B, attached to Ord. 14586 and incorporated in this chapter. The acceptance of
any payment shall not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in

a release of any claim the grantor may have for additional sums payable by the
grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the
grantor.

franchise fee payable under this section shall be ten years from the date on

any time during the term of the franchise equal to the maximum allowed by
federal law. However, such request shall be made in writing, and the grantee

event, be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including, but
not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, except to the entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the grantee, without the prior
written consent of the franchising authority.
      (2)   Such consent as required by the franchising authority shall be
given or denied no later than 120 days following any request and shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
      (3)   Prior consent shall not be required when transferring the franchise
between wholly owned subsidiaries of the same entity, nor shall such consent be
required for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation or
assignment of any rights, title or interest of the grantee in the cable system
in order to secure indebtedness.
   (B)   If the grantee sells or otherwise transfers ownership in the cable
system, such sale or transfer shall conform to § 617 of the Cable Act. For the
purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or
acquisition of control, the franchising authority may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall
assist the franchising authority in any such inquiry. In seeking the grantee’s
consent to any change in ownership or control, the transferee shall have the
responsibility to:
      (1)   Show to the satisfaction of the franchising authority whether the
proposed purchaser, transferee or assignee (referred to as the “proposed
transferee”) which, in the case of a corporation, shall include all directors
and all persons having a legal or equitable interest of 50% or more of the
voting stock, has:
         (a)   Ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral
turpitude, including, but not limited to, any violation of federal, state or
local law or regulations or is presently under an indictment, investigation or

the right to withhold approval of the transfer until the transferee has
provided the information required in this division (B)(1).
      (2)   Establish, to the satisfaction of the franchising authority, the
financial solvency of the proposed transferee by submitting all current
financial data for the proposed transferee which the grantee was required to
submit in its franchise application, and such other data as the franchising
authority may request, where such shall be audited, certified and qualified by
a certified public accountant; and
      (3)   Establish to the satisfaction of the franchising authority any
technical capability of the proposed transferee is such as shall enable it to
maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining term of the franchise
under the existing franchise terms.
   (C)   (1)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or
its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation
of the franchise shall have the right to notify the franchising authority that
the financial institution or its designee, as approved in writing by the
franchising authority, shall take control and operate the cable system if the
grantee defaults in its financial obligations.
      (2)   Further, such financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all
franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the cable system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the
franchising authority at its discretion, but, during such period of time, it
shall have the right to petition the franchising authority to transfer the
franchise to another grantee.
      (3)   Except insofar as the enforceability of this division (C) may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and further subject to
applicable federal, state or local law, if the franchising authority finds that
such transfer, after considering the legal, financial and technical qualities
of the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the franchising authority shall
transfer and assign the right and obligations of such franchise as in the
public interest.
   (D)   The consent or approval of the franchising authority to any transfer
by the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the
franchising authority in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its
terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise.
   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the franchise
agreement.
   (F)   The franchising authority may approve the transfer or deny the
transfer pursuant to § 617 of the Cable Act.
   (G)   When the grantor approves a transfer under this section, the new
grantee shall indicate acceptance of the franchise as specified in §
114.025 of this chapter, including the filing of all necessary bonds, funds,
proofs of insurance and certifications.
   (H)   The restrictions of this section shall be effective immediately upon

analyze and report on the performance of the cable system. The grantor may also
perform technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a
manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or
not the grantee is in compliance with the terms of this chapter and applicable
state or federal laws. Such tests may be undertaken only after giving the
grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than ten business days, and
providing a representative of the grantee has an opportunity to be present
during such tests. If such testing demonstrates that the grantee has
substantially complied with such material provisions of this chapter, the cost
of such testing shall be borne by the franchising authority. Except in
emergency circumstances, the franchising authority agrees that such testing
shall be undertaken no more than once a year and that the results thereof shall
be made available to the grantee.
   (B)   Any special performance tests or measurements required by the grantor
shall be reported to the grantor within 14 business days after such tests or

recorded.

any public records required to be kept by the grantee pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this chapter, the grantee shall not be required to

in nature under state and federal rules of evidence. The franchising authority
agrees to treat any information disclosed by the grantee as confidential and
only to disclose it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have
a need to know or in order to enforce the provisions of this chapter. The
grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of
§ 631 of the Cable Act.

   (A)   (1)   In recognition of the fact that a great many technical,
financial, marketing and legal uncertainties are associated with all aspects of
cable communications at the present time, it is the intent of the city to

Section
   
131.001   Theft
   
131.002   Tampering with, damaging or trespassing upon motor vehicle
   
131.003   Library materials and equipment
   
131.004   Trespass
   
131.005   Throwing missiles
   
131.006   Littering
§ 131.001 THEFT.
   A person commits theft, which is prohibited, when the person does any of the
following:
   (A)   Takes possession or control of the property of another or property in
the possession of another, with the intent to deprive the other thereof;
   (B)   Misappropriates property which the person has in trust or property of
another which the person has in the person’s possession or control, whether
such possession or control is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it
in a manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the trust or of the
owner’s rights in such property, or conceals found property or appropriates
such property to the person’s own use, when the owner of such property is known
to the person. Failure by a bailee or lessee of personal property to return the
property within 72 hours after a time specified in a written agreement of lease
or bailment shall be evidence of misappropriation;
   (C)   Obtains the labor or services of another or a transfer of possession,
control or ownership of the property of another or the beneficial use of
property of another, by deception. Where compensation for goods and services is
ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or the rendering
of such services, the refusal to pay or leaving the premises without payment or
offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner or operator the right to
pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an inference that the
goods or services were obtained by deception;
   (D)   Exercises control over stolen property, knowing such property to have
been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property has been
stolen, unless the person’s purpose is to promptly restore it to the owner or
to deliver it to an appropriate public officer. The fact that the person is
found in possession of property which has been stolen from two or more persons
on separate occasions or that the person is a dealer or other person familiar
with the value of such property and has acquired it for a consideration which
is far below its reasonable value shall be evidence from which the court or
jury may infer that the person knew or believed that the property had been
stolen;
   (E)   Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which someone
else has a security interest, with intent to defraud the secured party;
   (F)   Makes, utters, draws, delivers or gives any check, share draft, draft
or written order on any bank, credit union, person or corporation and obtains
property, the use of property, including rental property, or service in
exchange for such instrument, if the person knows that such check, share draft,
draft or written order will not be paid when presented. Whenever the drawee of
such instrument has refused payment because of insufficient funds, and the
maker has not paid the holder of the instrument the amount due thereon within
ten days of the maker’s receipt of notice from the holder that payment has been
refused by the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such facts that the
maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on presentation. Notice of
refusal of payment shall be by certified mail or by personal service in the
manner prescribed for serving original notices. Whenever the drawee of such
instrument has refused payment because the maker has no account with the
drawee, the court or jury may infer from such fact that the maker knew that the
instrument would not be paid on presentation; and/or
   (G)   Obtains gas, electricity or water from a public utility or obtains
cable television or telephone service from an unauthorized connection to the
supply or service line or by intentionally altering, adjusting, removing or
tampering with the metering or service device so as to cause inaccurate
readings.
(2013 Code, § 21-8) (Ord. 75, passed 8-14-1950) Penalty, see §
130.999
§ 131.002 TAMPERING WITH, DAMAGING OR TRESPASSING UPON MOTOR VEHICLE.
   It shall be unlawful to do or commit any of the following acts within the
city limits:
   (A)   Willfully attempt to tamper with or tamper with any motor vehicle, or
break or remove any part or parts of or from a motor vehicle without the
consent of the owner;
   (B)   Climb upon or enter into any motor vehicle whether it is in motion or
at rest and pilfer its contents or remove items of personal property therefrom;
   (C)   Climb upon or enter into any motor vehicle without the consent of the
owner and commit any malicious mischief thereon whether it is in action or at
rest; and/or
   (D)   Climb upon or enter into any motor vehicle without the owner’s
consent, whether it is in action or at rest, and manipulate any of the levers,
starting mechanism, brakes or other mechanism or device of the motor vehicle.

130.999
§ 131.003 LIBRARY MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   The fact that a person has concealed library materials or equipment,
as defined in I.C.A. § 702.22, or unpurchased property of a store or other
mercantile establishment, either on the premises or outside the premises, is
material evidence of intent to deprive the owner, and the finding of library
materials or equipment or unpurchased property concealed upon the person or
among the belongings of the person is material evidence of intent to deprive
and, if the person conceals or causes to be concealed library materials or
equipment or unpurchased property, upon the person or among the belongings of
another, the finding of the concealed materials, equipment or property is also
material evidence of intent to deprive on the part of the person concealing the
library materials, equipment or goods.
   (B)   The fact that a person fails to return library materials for two
months or more after the date the person agreed to return the library materials
or fails to return library equipment for one month or more after the date the
person agreed to return the library equipment is evidence of intent to deprive
the owner, provided a reasonable attempt, including the mailing by restricted
certified mail of notice that such material or equipment is overdue and
criminal actions will be taken, has been made to reclaim the materials or
equipment. Notices stating the provisions of this section and I.C.A. § 808.12
with regard to library materials or equipment shall be posted in clear public
view: in all public libraries; in all libraries of educational, historical or
charitable institutions, organizations or societies; in all museums; and in all
repositories of public records.
   (C)   After the expiration of three days following the due date, the owner
of borrowed library equipment may request the assistance of a dispute
resolution center, mediation center or appropriate law enforcement agency in
recovering the equipment from the borrower.
   (D)   The owner of library equipment may require deposits by borrowers and,
for late returns, the owner may impose graduated penalties of up to 25% of the
value of the equipment, based upon the lateness of the return.
   (E)   For lost library materials or equipment, arrangements may be made to
make a monetary settlement.

(Ord. 14999, passed 7-13-2020)
§ 134.002 DEFINITIONS.
   All terminology used in this chapter and not defined in this section shall
be in conformance with application publications of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) or its successor body.
   A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL. The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on
a sound level meter using the A-weighting network. The level is designated dB
(a) or dBA.
   CALIBRATION CHECK. Operators of a sound level meter may certify the accuracy
of meter by either witnessing the integrity seal on the meter is intact and
that the device has a current certificate of calibration from an outside sound
meter testing lab; or, using a sound calibrator with the meter before
enforcement sampling to verify the device is functioning properly. The sound
calibrator emits a test sound at specific dB level(s) to compare sound level
meter readings.
   DECIBEL (dB). A logarithmic and dimensionless unit of measure often used in
describing the amplitude of sound.
   EMERGENCY WORK. Work made necessary to restore property to a safe condition
following a public calamity, work to restore public utilities or
infrastructure, or work required to protect persons or property from an
imminent danger.
   NOISE. A sound, especially one that is loud or unpleasant or that causes
disturbance.
   NOISE CONTROL OFFICE. The same as the Marshalltown Police Department and
shall have the responsibility of enforcing this chapter.
   NOISE DISTURBANCE. Any sound which endangers the welfare, safety or health
of a human being, or disturbs a reasonable person of normal sensitivities, or
devalues or injures personal or real property by exceeding authorized limits.
   PERSON. Any individual, association, partnership, corporation or officer
thereof.
   REASONABLE OPERATION. Use of construction, power tools, lawn and garden
equipment with a legitimate, timely purpose that minimizes disruption to nearby
persons; not used to cause annoyance or excessive disruption.
   SOUND. A temporal and spatial oscillation in pressure, or other physical
quantity, in a medium with internal forces that causes compression and
rarefaction of that medium, and which propagates at finite speed to distant
points.
   SOUND LEVEL METER. An instrument which includes a microphone, amplifier, RMS
detector, integrator or time average, output or display meter, and weighting
networks used to measure sound pressure levels in decibels when properly
calibrated or currently certified to be working correctly and the instrument is
of type 2 or better, which complies with American National Standards Institute
Standard 1.4-1971 or its successor.
   SOUND PRESSURE. The instantaneous difference between the actual pressure and
the average or barometric pressure at a given point in space, as produced by
sound energy.
   SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL. Twenty times the logarithm to the base ten of the
ratio of the RMS sound pressure to the reference pressure of twenty (20)
micronewtons per square meter (120 x 10 - 6N/m2). The sound pressure level is
denoted Lp or SPL and is expressed in decibels.

Table Notes:
1.   Refer to §
156.B.006, Development Types, for more details.
2.   The former zoning districts are from the Marshalltown Zoning Ordinance of
2010 (Ord. 14871, adopted April 12, 2010) which is repealed on the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance.
 
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.B.003 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Generally. The zoning districts set out in §
156.B.002, Zoning Districts Establishment, are shown on the Official Zoning
Map, which is a part of this Zoning Ordinance as fully as if it were written
out in detail. The Official Zoning Map is on file in the office of the
Engineering Department and is available for inspection during regular business
hours.
   (B)   Force and effect. The Official Zoning Map and all notations,
references, and other information shown on it have the same force and effect as
the text of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)   Status of the Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map on file controls in
the event of a conflict between the map on file and any other paper or digital
reproduction of the map.
   (D)   Omitted or annexed land. Any area not shown as being included in a
zoning district or annexed to the City of Marshalltown shall be deemed to be in
the RL, Low-Density Residential zoning district unless the City Council changes
the zoning district.
   (E)   Boundaries. Where there is uncertainty as to the boundaries of the
districts as shown on the District Map of the city, the Zoning Administrator
shall make a determination using the following criteria:
      (1)   Rights-of-way or easements. Where boundaries appear to follow
existing streets, alleys, railroad tracks, utility lines, or similar features,
the Zoning Administrator shall construe the zoning boundary to follow the
center line of the rights-of-way or easement. Where the location of these
features on the ground differs from that shown on the Official Zoning Map, the
features on the ground control are shown approximately following street and
alley lines, such street and alley lines shall be interpreted to be the
boundaries.
      (2)   City limits. Where district boundaries are indicated as
approximately following city limits, the Zoning Administrator shall consider
the city limits as the district boundaries.
      (3)   Property lines. Where boundaries are indicated so that they
approximately follow lot lines and are not more than 15 feet distant therefrom,
such lot lines shall be interpreted to be the boundaries.
      (4)   Unsubdivided property. In unsubdivided property where a district
boundary divides a parcel of land, the boundary shall be determined by the use
of the scale appearing thereon.
      (5)   Watercourses. The Zoning Administrator shall construe boundaries
shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline of drainageways,
streams, water bodies, or other watercourses, as following the centerline. In
the event of a natural change in the location of such streams or other
watercourses, the Zoning Administrator shall construe the zoning district
boundary as moving with the centerline.
      (6)   Vacation or abandonment. Whenever any street, alley, or other
public way is vacated by the action of the City Council, the zoning district
adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public way shall be extended
automatically to the center of such vacated area.
      (7)   Ownership. When a lot held in one ownership is divided by a
district boundary line, the entire lot will be construed to be within the
district in which the majority of the lot is located.
   (F)   Conflicts resolved. In case of a conflict between the district
boundaries on the Official Zoning Map and the zoning of property provided by an
adopted ordinance, the ordinance controls. In case of doubt or dispute, the
Board of Adjustment shall determine the boundary lines upon receiving an appeal
from a ruling of the Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.B.004 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally. 
Table 156.B.004-1, Residential District Lot and Building Standards, establishes
the dimensional standards for the various housing/building and development
types in the residential zoning districts. Except as provided in §
156.B.008, Measurements and Allowances, and §
156.B.006, Development Types, no lot shall be reduced in size so that its area,
width, setback requirements, gross density, or other requirements of
Table 156.B.004-1 are not maintained.
   (B)   Setbacks related to driveways and garages. A minimum setback of 20
feet shall apply where a driveway provides access on a residential property
from a street, other than an alley. This maintains an adequately sized parking
space on the driveway between the structure and the street and helps to avoid
encroachment into public sidewalks, despite lower minimum setback standards in
Table 156.B.004-1 for the remainder of the building. See §
156.D.003(C) for specific requirements for garage orientation and placement.
   (C)   Measurements and allowances reference. Refer to §
156.B.008, Measurements and Allowances, for explanations of, and special
provisions related to, the measurements and standards in
Table 156.B.004-1.

§ 156.B.005 NONRESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally. 
Table 156.B.005-1, Nonresidential and Mixed-Use District Lot and Building
Standards, establishes the dimensional standards for the various housing/
building types in the nonresidential and mixed-use zoning districts. Except as
provided in §
156.B.008, Measurements and Allowances, and §
156.B.006, Development Types, no lot shall be reduced in size so that its area,
width, setback requirements, gross density, or other requirements of
Table 156.B.005-1 are not maintained.
   (B)   Setbacks related to driveways and garages. A minimum setback of 20
feet shall apply where a driveway provides access on a residential property
from a street, other than an alley. This maintains an adequately sized parking
space on the driveway between the structure and the street and helps to avoid
encroachment into public sidewalks, despite lower minimum setback standards in
Table 156.B.005-1 for the remainder of the building.
   (C)   Measurements and allowances reference. Refer to §
156.B.008, Measurements and Allowances, for explanations of, and special
provisions related to, the measurements and standards in
Table 156.B.005-1.

(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.B.006 DEVELOPMENT TYPES.
   (A)   Development types. New developments that are primarily residential or
mixed-use are classified into conventional, cluster, and infill. Development of
any development type permitted in the zoning district is at the option of the
applicant. Where more than one development type is permitted in a zoning
district, no development type is mandatory. Refer to §
156.B.004, Residential District Development Standards, for lot density and
dimension standards related to each permitted development and housing type
combination.
   (B)   Permitted residential districts. 
Table 156.B.006-1, Permitted Development Types by Residential District,
establishes the development types that are permitted in each residential zoning
district.
 
Table 156.B.006-1
Permitted Development Types by Residential District
Development Types           AG RR RL RM RH
                            "P" = Permitted | "--" = Not Permitted

   (C)   Applicability. This section established standards that are specific or
unique to the various permitted development types.
   (D)   Development types.
      (1)   Conventional.
         (a)   Description. The conventional development type, as depicted in
Figure 156.B.006-1, is a pattern that allows primarily residential uses and
that provides the majority of residential property owners with private open
space on their own property. A conventional development type consists of
varying housing types depending on the zoning district and minimum lot size is
a primary factor in the character built environment of the development.
         (b)   Standards. All the requirements of this article shall apply to
conventional development types unless otherwise specified.
 
Figure 156.B.006-1
Conventional Development Type

      (2)   Cluster.
         (a)   Description. A cluster development type, as depicted in
Figure 156.B.006-2, consists of smaller lots than conventional development that
are clustered together in order to provide for common civic and open spaces.
The common open space may be set-aside for resource features such as private
parks, recreation areas, woodlands, creeks, streams, and their riparian areas,
floodplains, and similar features. Cluster development may be used to preserve
environmental resources by clustering lots on the buildable portions of the
property.
         (b)   Housing types. At least two permitted housing types as listed in
Table 156.C.003-1, Use Table, shall be provided and no one lot size/
configuration dwelling type may exceed a total of 70% of all the residential
units in the development.
         (c)   Minimum site area. The minimum site area required for a cluster
development is five acres.
         (d)   Common civic and open space requirements.
            1.   Regardless of whether common open space is on privately or
publicly owned property, the space shall be open to the public at the same
hours as a comparable city park.
            2.   A minimum of 75% of the required civic and open space shall
consist of the natural area open space type per §
156.B.006, Civic and Open Space Types. Open space shall be integrated into the
development design so as to bring access to significant open space to the
maximum number of properties; provided, however, that physical access may be
limited if such limitation would materially enhance natural resource
management.
            3.   Land area within the cluster development dedicated to
permitted public and institutional, office, and retail, sales, and service use
categories shall not exceed 10% of the total land area of the development. In
addition, such uses may be counted toward 10% of the common open space
requirement established in §
156.B.004, Residential District Development Standards. For example, a 20-acre
cluster development with single-family attached and detached dwellings requires
three acres (15% of the development) of civic and common open space. The
development may have up to two acres of nonresidential uses and 13,068 square
feet of the nonresidential development counts toward the civic and open space
requirement.
         (e)   Minimum lot area adjacent to other development. Where adjacent
to existing conventional single-family development, cluster development lots on
the perimeter shall be:
            1.   Equal to or greater than the lot area and width of the
adjacent lots;
            2.   Separated from adjacent lots by a Type A bufferyard; or
            3.   The dwelling units on the perimeter cluster lots shall be set
back from the boundary of the cluster development a minimum of the following
distances based on the number of cluster lots being developed:
               A.   One to ten lots: 30 feet;
               B.   Eleven to 30 lots: 40 feet; and
               C.   Thirty-one or more lots: 50 feet.
         (f)   Distance from residential lots. All required common open space
types shall be located a minimum of 1,200 feet from any residential lot within
the cluster development, measured along a sidewalk or trail from the nearest
property line of the lot to the nearest property line of the open space.
         (g)   Buffering requirements. A bufferyard along the perimeter of the
cluster development may count toward the required common open space. However,
no more than 25% of the total required open space may be within the perimeter
buffer yard.
         (h)   Shoulders and drainage swales. Improved shoulders and drainage
swales, designed in accordance with design standards approved by the City
Engineer, may be utilized rather than curbs.

      (3)   Infill.
         (a)   Description. An infill development type, as depicted in Figure

         (b)   Eligibility for infill. An infill development type may be
located on any parcel:
            1.   Vacant or unoccupied. That is surrounded by existing developed
properties and has been vacant or unoccupied for more than one year;
            2.   Utility easements. Where adjacent properties abutting at least
50% of the non-street perimeter of the subject property are utility easements
that create a substantial break in development or redevelopment potential;
            3.   Environmental constraints. Where adjacent properties abutting
at least 50% of the non-street perimeter of the subject property are encumbered
by environmentally sensitive or constrained areas such as floodplains; or
            4.   Existing development. Where adjacent properties abutting at
least 50% of the non-street perimeter of the subject property are developed
with single-family dwellings of higher density or intensity uses.
         (c)   Appearance. Infill development shall be constructed to be
generally compatible in appearance with other existing structures in the
context, as established in division (D)(3)(j), Context, below, that comply with
this Zoning Ordinance.
         (d)   Alternative standards. In place of the standards in §
156.B.004, Residential District Development Standards, and other standards of
this Zoning Ordinance, the applicant may utilize the following alternative
standards.
         (e)   Lot area and width. The minimum lot area may be that of the
smallest lot in the context of the development, as defined in division (D)(3)
(j), Context, below. The minimum lot width may be that of the narrowest lot in
the context of the development. Refer to
Chapter 157, Land Subdivision Regulations, for requirements related to
replatting existing lots.
         (f)   Maximum building height. The maximum building height may be that
of the tallest building in the context, plus 15% of the height.
         (g)   Minimum/maximum setbacks.
            1.   The minimum front or street side setback may be that of 80% of
the average front or street side setbacks in the context of the development.
            2.   The maximum front and street side setback, where applicable,
may be that of the average of the front and street side setbacks of the context
of the development, plus 10%.
            3.   The minimum side and rear setbacks may be that of 80% of the
average side or rear setbacks in the context of the development.
         (h)   Buffering. Except as required for specific uses in Article C,
Use Standards, where a buffer is required along a street or parking area, or
between zoning districts, the buffer width and planting materials per 100 feet
may be reduced by 50%.
         (i)   Parking. The development may take advantage of the parking
credits and reductions in §
156.E.006, Parking Credits and Reductions.
         (j)   Context. This division identifies various contexts that inform
the allowances provided in division (D)(3)(d), Alternative Standards, above,
and as depicted in Figure 156.B.006-4, Context Illustrations.
            1.   Alley lot. If the infill site is an alley lot (shown in blue),
then the context consists of other adjacent alley lots and the surrounding lots
within the block that includes the infill site (shown in green).
            2.   Corner lot. If the infill site is a corner lot, then the
context consists of both block faces that include the infill site and the lots
directly across the street from the infill site.
            3.   Interior lot. If the infill site is an interior lot, then the
context consists of the block face that includes the infill site and the lots
directly across the street from the infill site.
            4.   Lots in unimproved block face. If the infill site is within a
block face that does not include other lots improved with buildings, then the
context consists of the opposing block faces (being immediately opposite the
same street as the project site) and the remaining lots on the block of the
infill site.
            5.   Lots in unimproved block. If the infill site is within a block
that does not include other lots improved with buildings, and the block face
opposite the given project site does not include other lots improved with
buildings, then the context consists of the block faces surrounding the block
that includes the infill site.

                  Multi-Sided Signs: For projecting or double-faced signs, only

                  by the faces is 30 degrees or less, provided that the signs

                  parallel or within 30 degrees of parallel, each sign face is
                  counted as a separate sign. If the two faces of a double-

Subsection 156.B.008.b Allowances
   (A)   Generally. The provisions of this section set forth any special cases
that warrant flexibility in the developmental standards in this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (B)   Lot width and area. At the option of the applicant, the minimum lot
area and width dimensions in §
156.B.004, Residential District Development Standards, may be considered
averages for an individual conventional development in each zoning district or
cluster development in the RL district. Lot averaging may only be applied where
both of the following conditions apply:
      (1)   The average lot area and average lot width of the development are
equal to or greater than the lot area and lot width specified in §
156.B.004.
      (2)   No lot shall have a lot area or lot width that is less than 90% of
the minimum lot area or lot width specified in §
156.B.004 (see Figure 156.B.008.b-1, Lot Averaging).

   (C)   Height requirements.
      (1)   Exemptions. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the height
regulations in this Zoning Ordinance do not apply to penthouse or roof
structures for the housing of elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, or
similar equipment required to operate and maintain the building, and fire or
parapet walls, skylights, towers attached to a building, steeples, flagpoles
attached to a building, chimneys, smokestacks, water tanks, silos, grain
elevators, or similar structures.
      (2)   Floor space calculation. No penthouse, roof structure, or any space
above the height limit shall be allowed for the purpose of providing additional
floor space.
      (3)   Setback plane. As depicted in Figure 156.B.008.b-2, Setback Plane,
where a multi-family, nonresidential, or mixed-use building adjoins a property
with a single-family detached or attached dwelling, the building height may be
increased beyond the maximum permitted if the setback nearest the adjoining
residence is increased one foot for each one foot of height above the maximum
permitted height.

   (D)   Yard requirements. The yard requirements in this Zoning Ordinance do
not apply to the following projections into required yards:
      (1)   Fire escapes, stairs, and balconies. Unenclosed fire escapes,
stairways, and/or balconies, covered or uncovered, shall extend not more than
four feet into the required front or rear yard.
      (2)   Architectural features. Cornices, eaves, canopies, sunshades,
gutters, chimneys, flues, belt courses, headers, sills, pilasters, lintels,
ornamental features, box windows, or other similar architectural features that
do not bear on the foundation shall project not more than two feet into any
required yard.
      (3)   Bay windows and chimneys. Within any residential district, bay
windows (with a gross floor area of less than or equal to 12 square feet) shall
extend not more than two feet into any required yard.
      (4)   Cul-de-sacs. For lots fronting on cul-de-sacs, the minimum front
yard shall be five feet.
      (5)   Garages. Front-loaded garages shall have a minimum setback of 20
feet, regardless of the required minimum setback for the remainder of the
building.
   (E)   Lots. Regardless of the lot area or width, all lots in the RM and RH
districts that existed prior to April 12, 2010, are deemed "conforming" with
respect to lot area and lot width if they contain an existing, permanent,
permitted residential dwelling. The lot width and area requirements of §
156.B.004, Residential District Development Standards, apply only in the event
of a replatting of the property.

columns. Where rows and columns intersect, a letter indicates if the use is
permitted, permitted with limitations, special, or prohibited in the district.
   (B)   Use categories. Uses are grouped in Table 156.C.003-1 by use category.
Use categories are defined, and specific uses that make up a use category are
listed, in § 156.M.003, Definitions.
   (C)   Abbreviations. Table 156.C.003-1 uses the following abbreviations:
      (1)   "P" means that the land use is permitted by right, subject to the
standards that apply to all permitted uses.
      (2)   "L" means that the land use is permitted with limitations, in the
same manner as a permitted use, but is also subject to §
156.C.004, Limited Use Standards.
      (3)   "S" means that the use is allowed as a special use, which may be
approved following a public hearing by the Plan and Zoning Commission and the
Board of Adjustment, subject to:
         (a)   Section
156.C.005, Special Use Permit Standards; and
         (b)   The procedures set forth in §
156.J.003, Legislative Review Procedures.
      (4)   "--" means that the use is a prohibited use in the specified
district.
      (5)   "Cv" means the conventional development type.
      (6)   "Cl" means the cluster development type.
      (7)   "In" means the infill development type.
   (D)   Special and limited uses. Where a specific use is a special use in a
given district and permitted with limitations in another district then the
standards for the use are located in §
156.C.005.
   (E)   Standards. The "standards" column provides a reference to associated
standards for uses permitted with limitations and for special uses. Where "N/A"
is in the column, there is no associated standard because the use is permitted
by right or there is no specific special use standard.

§ 156.C.004 LIMITED USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote compatibility among
land uses in the city by establishing specific standards for the establishment
of limited uses which are indicated in the use tables in §
156.C.003, Use Table.
   (B)   Application. Limited uses may be authorized by the Zoning
Administrator, or designee, for uses shown as limited "L" and only if they meet
the standards of this section and other applicable standards and requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)   Timing of compliance. The standards of this section apply at the time
a limited use is requested to be established in an existing or new structure,
or when an existing limited use is proposed to be expanded by more than 10% of
the existing square footage currently devoted to the use. This section applies
to an expansion of use whether it is to or within an existing building, in an
outdoor area devoted to the use, or a combination of these characteristics.
   (D)   Standards for all limited uses. An application for limited use permit
may be approved if, in addition to the specific standards of this section that
apply to the use, it is demonstrated that:
      (1)   The proposed limited use in its proposed location shall not
conflict with the implementation of current adopted plans of the city; and
      (2)   The limited use is compatible with surrounding land uses and
natural environment, and shall not materially detract from the character of the
immediate area or negatively affect the anticipated development or
redevelopment trajectory (for example, by creating a critical mass of similar
limited uses that is likely to discourage permitted uses by making the vicinity
less desirable for them).
   (E)   Specific standards for limited uses.
      (1)   Community garden.
         (a)   No sale of items grown or any other items may take place on-
site.
         (b)   Storage of equipment and materials shall be inside a structure
or screened.
         (c)   Compost storage, if utilized, shall have a setback of a minimum
of 30 feet from the front and ten feet from any side or rear property line.
Compost storage shall be used only to support onsite operations.
         (d)   Community gardens that have ceased permanent operation or been
abandoned, shall be cleared, all associated structures removed, and the area
re-vegetated no more than 30 days after the date of discontinued operations,
unless otherwise specified by the Zoning Administrator, not to exceed 90 days.
      (2)   Kennel. Outdoor runs shall be prohibited.
      (3)   Plant nursery, greenhouse, and landscaping business. Outdoor
storage areas shall be enclosed with a fence or wall that is in compliance with
§
156.F.005, Screening.
      (4)   All other agriculture and animal-related services. The use shall
not include activity which may be considered a public nuisance which is
offensive to adjacent properties due to increased noise, traffic or odors.
      (5)   Upper-story residential.
         (a)   The use shall comply with the development standards of a mixed-
use building.
         (b)   The minimum floor area of the use shall be 300 square feet.
         (c)   The maximum density of the district shall not apply.
      (6)   Day care uses (child and adult).
         (a)   The use shall be operated in accordance with all applicable laws
and, if a state permit is required, such permit shall be obtained prior to
beginning operation.
         (b)   The use may be part of a place of public assembly, provided the
place of public assembly is in conformance with the standards of this Zoning
Ordinance.
         (c)   Primary access to the site shall be from a public roadway.
      (7)   All other educational facilities. All buildings shall be located at
least 50 feet from any adjoining property line, including right-of-way lines.
      (8)   Public assembly uses.
         (a)   Parking shall be provided on-site or off-site with Zoning
Administrator approval.
         (b)   The use shall be conducted so that it does not create parking or
traffic congestion or otherwise unreasonably interfere with the peace and
enjoyment of surrounding homes as places of residence.
         (c)   Expansion to abutting lots or parcels shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   The applicant shall control the property onto which the
expansion is proposed;
            2.   It shall allow the use to take access from a public roadway;
            3.   It will involve the installation of a Type B bufferyard
between the use and abutting residential uses, unless equivalent buffering is
already provided; and
            4.   The expansion will not involve the location of buildings or
parking within 50 feet of residential property.
      (9)   Farmers market.
         (a)   The site shall be supplied with electrical power at secured, in-
ground stations that may be accessed by temporary users.
         (b)   The use is separated from all residential property by a Type B
bufferyard, in accordance with §
156.F.004, Buffering, or a local street or collector roadway.
         (c)   The use will be conducted so that it does not create parking or
traffic congestion or otherwise unreasonably interfere with the peace and
enjoyment of surrounding homes as places of residence.

         (a)   Screening. Outdoor storage shall be fully screened from adjacent
nonindustrial uses.
         (b)   Bufferyard. The use shall be separated from a nonindustrial use
by a Type C Bufferyard, in accordance with §
156.F.004, Buffering.
      (13)   Micro-manufacturing.
         (a)   Gross floor area. The maximum gross floor area of a micro-
manufacturing facility shall not exceed 5,000 square feet.
         (b)   Outdoor storage. No outdoor storage is permitted.
      (14)   Research and development laboratory.
         (a)   All testing conducted onsite is within a fully enclosed

within a building, except limited daily outdoor operations and storage may
occur behind the building and a minimum of 50 feet from any property line.
         (b)   Nuisances. No impacts or by-products of the use, including
noise, dust, or odor shall be discernible from abutting property.
         (c)   Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage shall be screened from view
from the public-right-of-way and adjacent properties with a Type C Bufferyard
in accordance with §
156.F.004, Buffering.

§ 156.C.006 FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICTS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in I.C.A. Chapter
414, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from floods and to promote health and the general welfare.
   (B)   Flooding. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the
community. These losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
      (1)   The cumulative effect of floodplain construction on flood flows,
which causes increases in flood heights and flood water velocities; and
      (2)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding.
   (C)   Methodology. This Zoning Ordinance relies upon engineering methodology
for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established
by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
   (D)   Intent. The provisions of this section are designed to:
      (1)   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood
flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially;
      (2)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
      (3)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (4)   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard; and
      (5)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   (E)   Applicability. The regulations of the Flood Hazard Districts shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the Floodway
Boundary and Floodway Map to be within the 100-year flood boundaries.
   (F)   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps prepared as part of the "Flood Insurance Study for the City
of Marshalltown, Iowa", dated April 17, 1984, are hereby adopted by reference
and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The flood profiles and
all explanatory material provided with the "Flood Insurance Study" and the
Flood Insurance Rate Maps are also declared to be a part of this section.
   (G)   Rules for Flood Hazard Overlay Districts boundaries interpretation.
The boundaries of the Flood Hazard Overlay Districts shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Floodplain Map. Where interpretation is
needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on
the Official Zoning Map, the Floodplain Administrator or Engineering Department
shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of
the overlay boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their
case and submit technical evidence.
   (H)   Compliance. No structure or land shall be used and no structure shall
be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this Zoning Ordinance and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (I)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   (J)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be literally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (K)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
section does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses
permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Marshalltown for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or
any administrative decision resulting from this section.
   (L)   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected by such
judgement.
   (M)   Flood Hazard Overlay Districts established. The floodplain areas
within the jurisdiction of this Zoning Ordinance are divided into the following
subdistricts:
      (1)   Floodway Overlay District. The Floodway Overlay District shall be
consistent with the boundaries of the floodway as shown on the Official
Floodplain Map.
      (2)   Floodway Fringe Overlay District. The Floodway Fringe Overlay
District shall be those areas shown as floodway fringe on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map designated as Zones A2 - A4, A6, and A8.
      (3)   General Floodplain Overlay District. The General Floodplain Overlay
District shall be those areas shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map as
being within the approximate 100-year flood boundary designated as Zone A.
   (N)   Floodway Overlay District.
      (1)   Permitted uses. All uses within the Floodway Overlay District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district), and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Overlay District.
      (2)   Performance standards. All floodway subdistrict uses allowed as a
permitted or special use shall meet the following standards:
         (a)   No use shall be permitted in the floodway subdistrict that would
result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
         (b)   All uses within the floodway subdistrict shall:
            1.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
            2.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize
flood damage; and
            3.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage. No use shall affect the capacity or conveyance of
the channel or floodway or any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch,
swale, or any other drainage facility or system.
         (c)   Structures, buildings, and sanitary and utility systems, if
permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the floodway
fringe subdistrict, and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum
possible resistance to flood flows.
         (d)   If permitted, buildings, shall have a low flood damage
potential, and shall not be for human habitation, and shall adhere to all
applicable provisions of this section.
         (e)   Storage of equipment or materials that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway
subdistrict within the time available after flood warning.
         (f)   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the United States
Corps of Engineers, and other applicable agencies.
         (g)   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be permitted by the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources and shall be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
         (h)   Subject to all applicable permits of regulating agencies,
pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and banks
or otherwise sufficiently stabilized and protected to prevent rupture due to
channel degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
   (O)   Floodway Fringe Overlay District.
      (1)   Permitted uses. All uses within the floodway fringe subdistrict
shall be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other
ordinance or underlying zoning district, and provided they meet applicable
performance standards of the floodway fringe subdistrict.
      (2)   Performance standards. All uses must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and shall meet the following applicable performance
standards.
         (a)   All structures. All structures shall:
            1.   Be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure;
            2.   Be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant
to flood damage; and
            3.   Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
         (b)   Residential buildings. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basements,
elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one
foot above the 100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers) may be allowed, subject to favorable consideration by
the Floodplain Administrator, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential buildings shall be
provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles
during the 100-year flood.
         (c)   Non-residential buildings. All new or substantially improved
non-residential buildings shall have the first floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood-proofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the state
shall certify that the flood-proofing methods used are adequate to withstand
the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other
factors associated with the 100-year flood, and that the structure, below the
100-year flood level, is water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to National Geodetic Vertical Datum) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
         (d)   New and improved structures. All new and substantially improved
structures:
            1.   Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
               A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               C.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
            2.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
            3.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.

156.C.007(E) for setback on corner lots.
 
   (F)   Accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Accessory dwelling units shall be
permitted in all residential zoning districts as an accessory use to single-
family detached on lots greater than or equal to 15,000 square feet, or the
single-family attached housing type in the Mixed-Use (MU) and Urban Core (UC)
zoning districts, subject to the following standards:
      (1)   ADU types. There are two types of ADUs:
         (a)   Integrated ADUs; and
         (b)   Detached ADUs.
      (2)   Integrated ADUs.
         (a)   Integrated ADUs are located within a permitted building and
shall comply with the building placement standards for the permitted and
associated principal building type.
         (b)   Integrated ADUs may be established by dividing space within a
principal building (See (A) in
Figure 156.C.007-1, below), or by adding floor area to an existing building
(See (B), below). Integrated ADUs may be accessed from within the principal
building or from outside, according to the standards of this section.
         (c)   Integrated ADUs appearance:
            1.   Integrated ADUs shall not involve design modifications to the
exterior of the principal building that make their presence obvious.
            2.   Where exterior doors provide direct access to the integrated
unit, such doors shall be designed, located, and configured in a manner that is
typical for secondary access to a residential dwelling (e.g. side doors, French
doors, etc.).
            3.   Any exterior stairs that would serve as the primary entrance
to the ADU shall be located on the side or rear of the principal structure and
are prohibited from being located on the front of the principal structure.
            4.   If a principal building is expanded to accommodate an
integrated ADU, the expansion shall be designed in a manner that is comparable
to the principal building.
            5.   Only one entrance may be located on the front facade of the
principal building facing the street unless the building contained additional
front entrances prior to the ADU's construction.
      (3)   Detached ADUs.
         (a)   Detached ADUs are dwelling units that are located inside of an
accessory structure, such as a detached residential garage (See (C) in
Figure 156.C.007-1, below) or detached structure (D).
         (b)   Where an improved alley adjacent to the lot exists, vehicular
access to the ADU shall take place from the alley.
         (c)   Generally, access to second-floor units shall be from internal
stairs. External stairs may be permitted where they are not located parallel to
an interior side property line or where the Administrator determines that
screening features are in place to protect the privacy of an adjacent lot's
side yard.
         (d)   In the RL, RM, RH, and in the Single-Family Attached building
type in the Mixed-Use (MU) zoning districts, where a detached ADU is proposed,
the owner of the subject property shall live in either the principal residence
or the ADU.
         (e)   Prohibited locations. ADUs may not be established within
manufactured homes or structures and vehicles that do not have a permanent
foundation, including, but not limited to recreational vehicles, travel
trailers, or campers.
         (f)   Maximum floor area of the ADU.
            1.   Measurement. The floor area is measured as the area within the
ADU itself and does not include areas of an accessory building that are used
for other purposes, such as a detached garage or a workshop that is not
incorporated into the ADU.
            2.   Standard. The floor area of an ADU shall not exceed 50% of the
total square footage of the principal residential building to which it is
accessory, or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less.
         (g)   Required parking for ADUs. In the RL, RM, and RH districts, in
addition to the parking requirements for the principal residential use set out
in §
156.E.004, Required Off-Street Parking, one off-street parking space for the
ADU shall be provided.

increases the height of the facility by more than 10% or ten feet, whichever is
greater;
            2.   For towers outside of public rights-of-way, it protrudes from
the edge of the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower
structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for those
towers in the rights-of-way and for all wireless telecommunications facilities,
it protrudes from the edge of the support structure more than six feet;
            3.   It involves installation of more than the standard number of
new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four
cabinets;
            4.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current
site of the wireless telecommunications facility;
            5.   It would defeat the existing concealment elements of the
wireless telecommunications facility; or
            6.   It does not comply with conditions associated with the prior
approval of the tower or base station unless the non-compliance is due to an
increase in height, increase in width, addition of cabinets, or new excavation
that does not exceed the corresponding "substantial change" thresholds.

(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
ARTICLE D - BUILDING AND SITE DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 156.D.001 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to address the quality and
sustainable design of buildings and building sites in order to:
      (1)   Character. Preserve and enhance a community character that conveys
a positive, lasting impression on both residents and visitors;
      (2)   Functionality. Provide buildings that are functional, safe, and
attractive;
      (3)   Public realm. Establish the physical and functional relationships
between buildings and the public realm; and
      (4)   Form. Prescribe the rules related to building massing, form, and
design.
   (B)   Applicability. The standards of this article apply to the following
development activities:
      (1)   New development. New residential, nonresidential, or mixed-use
development or change in use from residential to nonresidential or mixed-use;
or
      (2)   Increase in intensity. Increase in apartment units, manufactured
home pads, gross floor area, or impervious surface by 25% or more, cumulatively
over a five-year period.
   (C)   Timing of compliance. A Certificate of Occupancy will not be issued
until all site improvements required in this article are constructed in
conformance with the approved permit or plan required in §
156.J.002, Common Review Provisions.
   (D)   Design practices. The principles below should be considered in all
design practices in addition to specific standards found in §
156.D.002, General Requirements:
      (1)   Clustering. Where applicable in the RL zoning district, housing
should be clustered to preserve valuable environmental resources and provide
usable recreational open space.
      (2)   Open space. The open space system is as carefully designed as the
housing area so as to offer usable permitted open space types visible from
roadways and spatially defined by abutting building facades and/or landscape
elements.
      (3)   Multimodal transportation. Vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle
transportation is facilitated through a connected system of roads, sidewalks,
and/or trails so as to provide many choices with regard to mode and route.
      (4)   Traffic calming. Traffic calming techniques may be used to reduce
vehicle speed and increase pedestrian and bicycle safety.
      (5)   Facade direction. Principal buildings address the street,
presenting front facades on the publicly visible side of the building. The
front facade of each principal building shall face a dedicated public street or
the limits of a private parking unit and no building shall have the rear facade
facing a dedicated public street.
      (6)   Parking design. The visual impact of vehicular off-street parking
and garages on public streetscape views is minimized through innovative site
planning and building design including parking areas located to the rear of
buildings, using architectural design elements such as massing, form,
materials, and fenestration to make garages visually compatible with inhabited
buildings, and parking areas screened with landscape elements.
      (7)   Support uses. Neighborhood support uses, such as neighborhood
commercial areas, daycare facilities, community centers, places of public
assembly, and schools are designed so as to be visually compatible with the
residential character of the neighborhood and accessible by all transportation
modes.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.D.002 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The city sees the interaction between the built environment
and the public as a crucial ingredient in maintaining a certain sense of place.
As a part of this, the visual aspects of overall building design and placement
must be scrutinized when considering a proposed development. This section
outlines design standards for building facades. These standards seek to
increase the prospect of compatibility between buildings, styles, and
generations. Designers must infuse their individual talents and creativity into
each project for these standards to be successful.
   (B)   Flexibility in administration. Because these standards cannot cover
every possible scenario that may arise, the Zoning Administrator is authorized
to make determinations on development applications that may vary from the
written standards so long as the determination meets the intent of this
article.
   (C)   Prohibited building materials. Except for single-family and duplex
dwellings, the following materials shall not be used as an exterior finish:
      (1)   Wood fiber hardboard siding, oriented strand board siding, plastic
or fiberglass panels;
      (2)   Galvanized, aluminum coated, zinc-aluminum coated or unpainted
exterior metal finishes;
      (3)   Unfired or underfired clay, sand, or shale brick; and
      (4)   Smooth or untextured concrete finishes.
   (D)   Primary materials. For the purposes of this section, the following are
deemed primary materials:
      (1)   Vinyl siding;
      (2)   Brick, including thin brick;
      (3)   Natural or manufactured stone;
      (4)   Pre-cast concrete panel, provided it has an integrated color and is
textured or patterned;
      (5)   EIFS, exterior insulation and finish system;
      (6)   Stucco with a weather barrier layer and wall drainage system; and
      (7)   Architectural masonry units including split face, weathered face,
sandblasted face and ground face blocks.
   (E)   Secondary materials. For the purposes of this section, the following
are deemed secondary materials.
      (1)   Embossed or pre-finished architectural metal panel (26+ gauge),
which has an appearance of masonry, stucco, or any other appearance that is
approved by the Zoning Administrator;
      (2)   Masonry or cement fiberboard siding that, for residential
applications, is manufactured and installed in traditional profiles such as
four-inch to eight-inch horizontal beveled or shake;
      (3)   Glass;
      (4)   Tile;
      (5)   Stainless steel;
      (6)   Chrome;
      (7)   Wood; and
      (8)   Smooth-faced finished concrete masonry units.
   (F)   Metal roofs. Metals roofs shall be allowed if the following conditions
are met or otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator:
      (1)   Openings shall not be seen on the fascia and shall be completely
covered with material designed and built for metal roofing systems;
      (2)   Corrugated galvanized steel panels shall not be used; and
      (3)   Roof and fastener color shall be the same, with the exception of
trim pieces.
   (G)   Ground-mounted equipment. Mechanical equipment mounted on the ground
and associated with apartments, nonresidential and mixed-use buildings,
including, but not limited to, HVAC systems and meter banks, shall be screened
from view from public and private streets by landscaping or screening walls.
   (H)   Refuse containers. Dumpsters shall be provided for multiple-family
residential, nonresidential, and mixed-use development for solid waste
collection services. Such facilities are subject to the following standards:
      (1)   The facilities shall be located no more than 200 feet (walking
distance) from the individual uses that they are intended to serve;
      (2)   Access to the facilities shall be:
         (a)   Configured to meet the requirements of the refuse hauler; and
         (b)   Provided from an alley if an alley is present and used for
service to other properties;
      (3)   The areas where dumpsters are stored shall be fully enclosed by an
opaque wall with a minimum height of six feet constructed of brick, stone,
stucco-finished concrete block, wood or vinyl;
      (4)   The enclosures shall:
         (a)   Have opaque service gates which remain closed at all times
except when the dumpster is being serviced;
         (b)   Include separate, opaque pedestrian access gates or a pedestrian
access opening that screens the dumpster from view;
         (c)   Be large enough to accommodate:
            1.   One or more dumpsters that are of sufficient size to serve the
development, based on the frequency of solid waste collection; and
            2.   One or more recycling bins (whether provided at the time of
development or not), based on the anticipated generation of recyclable
materials and the frequency of collection; and
         (d)   Meet city engineering design standards, including those that
pertain to maneuvering space.
      (5)   The facilities shall be located in a side or rear yard of the
parcel proposed for development unless it is not possible to provide service
access in such locations according to the refuse service provider; and
      (6)   If an enclosure must be located in a front yard to meet the
requirements of the refuse service provider, it shall be designated and
constructed with the same cladding materials used for the principal building
walls.
   (I)   Exemption. A building wall is exempt from the requirements of this
section under the following circumstances:
      (1)   The subject property is zoned GI, General Industrial;
      (2)   The building walls are not visible from an existing major arterial,
or minor arterial nor are they adjacent to a proposed street of such
classifications from the Comprehensive Plan; and
      (3)   The building contains uses in the following use categories:
         (a)   Heavy industrial use category;
         (b)   Light industrial use category;
         (c)   Warehousing and freight movement use category; or
         (d)   Wholesale trade use category.
   (J)   Alternative building materials and forms. The Zoning Administrator may
approve alternative building materials and forms not specified in this section
if the Zoning Administrator determines that, compared to the permitted primary
and secondary materials, the alternative:
      (1)   Is substantially equal to or better in quality, durability, and
appearance and will not violate any provision of this article;
      (2)   Is proposed in order to achieve a minimum bronze certification in
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED"), and the materials
qualify for LEED points under both the "energy and atmosphere criteria" and the
"materials and resources criteria" of the LEED checklists; or
      (3)   Is part of a building that is certified by the Environmental
Protection Agency as designed to earn an ENERGY STAR rating, and the materials
substantially improve the energy efficiency of the building compared to
materials that are permitted in this section.

ARTICLE E - PARKING, LOADING, AND STACKING
§ 156.E.001 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to ensure that:
      (1)   Provision of parking. Adequate, attractive, and safe off-street
parking is provided by this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Residential protection. Sufficient parking is provided in
nonresidential areas that are near residential neighborhoods, so that the
character and quality of life in the residential neighborhoods are protected
from overflow parking;
      (3)   Provision of loading spaces. Adequate loading areas are provided
that do not interfere with the function of other vehicular use areas;
      (4)   Provision of access. Access to sites are managed to maintain the
desired function and safety of the adjacent street(s); and
      (5)   Lighting. Vehicular use areas and sites are designed and lighted to
promote public safety without creating undue light pollution and off-site
glare.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Development activities. The standards of this article apply to the
following development activities:
         (a)   New residential, nonresidential, or mixed-use development or
change in use from residential to nonresidential or mixed-use;
         (b)   Increase in apartment units, manufactured home pads, gross floor
area, or impervious surface by 20% or more, cumulatively over a five-year
period; or
         (c)   Change in use requiring additional parking, loading, or stacking
spaces (also known as vehicle use areas).
      (2)   Exemptions.
         (a)   Changes in the use(s) of existing buildings that result in fewer
required parking, loading, or stacking spaces shall not be required to provide
additional parking spaces.
         (b)   A permitted use may be converted to another permitted use
without full compliance with the required number of parking, loading, or
stacking spaces if the Zoning Administrator determines:
            1.   No additional parking, loading, or stacking spaces could be
provided without removing or partially removing a structure; and
            2.   The amount of parking, loading, or stacking spaces available
is at least 80% of the parking, loading, or stacking required for the new use.
      (3)   Change of use (maximum parking). Uses with off-street parking in
excess of the maximum allowed for a nonresidential use resulting from a change
of use in an existing building are not required to remove the excess parking
spaces.
   (C)   Timing of compliance. A Certificate of Occupancy will not be issued
until all site improvements required in this article are constructed in
conformance with the approved permit or plan required in §
156.J.002, Common Review Provisions.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.E.002 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Generally. Off-street loading, stacking, and access shall be provided,
located, and designed in accordance with the standards of this article.
   (B)   Lighting and noise. The following standards shall apply to all vehicle
use areas:
      (1)   Lighting shall comply with Article H, Outdoor Lighting.
      (2)   An area used for primary circulation, frequent idling of vehicle
engines, or loading activity shall be designed and located to minimize the
effects of noise, pollution, and vehicle lights on an adjoining property.
   (C)   Associated building, use, or structure. Vehicle use areas (VUA) shall
be maintained as long as the associated building, use, or structure is in use
or operation. No person shall utilize such building, use, or structure without
providing the VUAs required in this article. It shall be unlawful to
discontinue, reduce, or remove the required VUAs apart from the discontinuance,
removal, or reduction of the building, use, or structure that requires the VUA.
   (D)   Maneuvering space.
      (1)   Prohibited. No VUA shall be designed or built to require a vehicle
to maneuver into a public right-of-way or overhang or encroach an adjacent
property under separate ownership in order to park, load, unload, or stack,
except:
         (a)   In the case of single-family and duplex dwellings where backing
onto the public right-of-way is permitted; or
         (b)   Where a cross-access easement is in place.
      (2)   Barrier. In order to prevent overhang or encroachment described in
division (D)(1), Prohibited, above, a VUA shall include a permanent curb, wall
or other physical barrier. Such a physical barrier shall be located a minimum
of two feet from the right-of-way or property line.
   (E)   Location. Except as permitted in §
156.E.006, Parking Credits and Reductions, a VUA required by this article shall
be located on the same property as the building, use, or structure it serves
and it shall be located behind any required bufferyard as set out in Article F,
Landscaping, Buffering, and Screening.
   (F)   Calculations.
      (1)   Fractions. If the final calculated number of required parking,
loading, or stacking spaces includes a fractional space, the number of required
spaces shall be increased to the next whole number if the fraction is five-
tenths or more, and when the fraction is less than five-tenths, the next lower
whole number shall apply.
      (2)   Variables for calculating required spaces. The variables used for
calculating spaces are measured as shown in Table 156.E.002, Parking, Loading,
and Stacking Variable Meanings.
Table 156.E.002
Parking, Loading, and Stacking Variable Meanings
Variable The number of required spaces is calculated based on the number of:
Table 156.E.002
Parking, Loading, and Stacking Variable Meanings
Variable The number of required spaces is calculated based on the number of:
Per
Dwelling Dwelling units on the subject property.
Unit
Per      Spaces available for a recreational vehicle to connect to utilities provided at
Campsite the recreational vehicle park.
Per      Bedrooms in the facility instead of the number of bed or some other measure.
Bedroom
Per
Gross    Gross floor area of the establishment, which measurement is described in
Floor    Subsection 156.B.008.a, Measurements.
Area
Per      Employees during the shift in which the maximum number of employees is present.
Employee
         Seats affixed to the floor that are provided to guests (patrons, members, etc.),
Per Seat with benches or pews measured as one seat per two feet of width. Space
         requirements for uses with unaffixed seats shall be based on the seating
         capacity permitted by the Fire Code and approved by the Fire Marshal’s office.
Per      Students or enrollees that the facility is permitted to have according to the
Student  appropriate licensing agency, if applicable.
 
      (3)   Multiple nonresidential uses. If several nonresidential uses occupy
a single parcel or building, the parking requirements shall be calculated
separately for each use within the development, or as set out in §
156.E.006, Parking Credits and Reductions, whichever results in a lesser number
of required spaces.
   (G)   Surfacing and drainage. All vehicle use areas shall be graded,
surfaced, and maintained so that water does not accumulate, flow, or drain onto
abutting public or private property. The surfacing of VUAs shall consist of
asphalt, concrete, or other all-weather surface approved by the City Engineer.
   (H)   Dedication of spaces. Off-street parking, loading, and stacking spaces
shall not be used interchangeably to meet one another's requirements nor shall
their placement interfere with one another's use.
   (I)   Insufficient vehicle use area. The Zoning Administrator may require a
landowner to provide additional VUA even if the number of spaces provided meets
the minimum requirement for the established use, if vehicles are consistently
required to park or unload on the street (where on-street parking is
prohibited) or on other properties due to a lack of usable VUA.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.E.003 PARKING DESIGN.
   (A)   Design and construction requirements.
      (1)   Tandem parking. Each parking space shall be accessible from a
street or alley through aisles and/or driveways, except that tandem parking
arrangements are permitted for single-family, two-family, and manufactured home
uses or as allowed based on an approved parking study as described in §

   (B)   Surfacing and drainage.
      (1)   Paving and grading. Except as set forth in division (D),
Alternative Paving Materials, below, all off-street parking areas, driveways,
and access drives must be paved with an all-weather surface and graded and
drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulations within the area.
      (2)   Equipment and service vehicles. Areas in rear and interior side
yards used to store equipment or service vehicles used in connection with the
operation of a business located on the premises in areas zoned General
Commercial or General Industrial, may be surfaced with gravel that is
maintained to eliminate blowing dust and erosion and must be screened per §
156.F.005, Screening, when adjacent to residential use or zoned areas or public
right-of-way.
   (C)   Setback. No part of any parking area shall be closer than five feet to
any established street right-of-way, alley, or property line. Where a parking
area of a non-residential use or district adjoins any residential use or
district, it shall be screened in accordance with the standard of §
156.F.004, Buffering.
   (D)   Alternative paving materials. The City Engineer may approve
alternative paving materials for parking areas not specified in §
156.E.002(B), Surfacing and Drainage, if the City Engineer determines that the
alternative, compared to the permitted materials, is substantially equal to or
better in quality and durability.
   (E)   Snow storage. Parking lots and landscaping and buffering required by
Article F, Landscaping, Buffering, and Screening, shall be designed so that
snow can be efficiently plowed into on-site storage areas. Snow storage areas
shall be located and designed so that:
      (1)   Reduction of spaces. The amount of parking on the site is not
reduced below 80% of the number of spaces required by
Table 156.E.004-1, Minimum and Maximum Off-Street Parking, when snow is stored
on-site;
      (2)   Circulation and visibility. Storage of snow does not interfere with
circulation on the site or with visibility at points of ingress or egress or at
street intersections;
      (3)   Landscape islands. Landscape islands shall not be used for snow
storage unless specifically identified on the site development plan. All light
poles, landscaping, or internal pedestrian pathways shall be protected from
vehicle encroachment with concrete curbing or similar permanent and elevated
landscaping elements approved by the Zoning Administrator;
      (4)   Risk mitigation. The location of the snow storage area does not
create an unreasonable risk of snow being pushed into street rights-of-way;
      (5)   Heavy snow events. The snow storage area is located and configured
so that snow can be removed from the site during periods of heavy snowfall that
are combined with sub-freezing temperatures; and
      (6)   Pervious storage area. The area under the stored snow is pervious
landscape area, and runoff from snowmelt is directed through stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) to slow water and improve its quality.

Notes:
1   In addition to the required and maximum for the primary use.
 
   (F)   Special studies.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Some of the uses listed in
Table 156.E.004-1, Minimum and Maximum Parking, have widely varying parking
demand characteristics. Accordingly, their parking requirements are listed as
"Special Study." Required parking for these uses are established according to
the standards of this section.
         (b)   Special studies may also be submitted to support a request to
reduce the number of required parking spaces to less than that set out in
Table 156.E.004-1, due to the nature of the operations and/or location of a
proposed use. The special study must include and support all requested
reductions in parking. Further parking credits and reductions that are
otherwise available pursuant to §
156.E.006, Parking Credits and Reductions, may not be applied when parking
reductions are granted pursuant to this section, unless the reductions are
supported by the special study.
      (2)   Special study requirements.
         (a)   A special study must be conducted by a qualified transportation
planner or traffic engineer at the applicant's expense.
         (b)   The special study must provide:
            1.   A peak parking analysis of at least five functionally
comparable uses; and
            2.   Documentation regarding the comparability of the referenced
uses, including: name, function, location, gross floor area, parking
availability, access to transportation network (including vehicular, bicycle,
pedestrian, and transit), use restrictions, and other factors that could affect
the parking demand.
      (3)   Approval of special study.
         (a)   The Zoning Administrator may rely upon the special study or may
request additional information or analysis, including, but not limited to:
alternative or new data points, or consideration of additional or alternative
factors related to comparability or peak demand, as supported by sound
engineering principles.
         (b)   As a condition of approval of a special study, the Zoning
Administrator may require that land be reserved as an undeveloped area for
additional future parking if there is a demonstrably high probability the use
could change, resulting in a higher demand for parking.
   (G)   Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not
specifically addressed in this article, the Zoning Administrator shall apply
the off-street parking standard specified for the use that the Zoning
Administrator deems most similar to the proposed use according to §
156.C.010, New and Unlisted Uses, or require that the applicant provide a
special study according to division (F), Special Studies, above.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022; Ord. 15091, passed 9-23-2024)
§ 156.E.005 REQUIRED ACCESSIBLE PARKING.
   (A)   Number of required spaces. Parking for disabled persons shall be
provided as set out in Table 156.E.005-1, Accessible Parking Requirements, or
as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards for
Accessible Design and ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities
published by the United States Access Board. If any of the standards within
this section and the United States Access Board are in conflict then whichever
requires more spaces shall be used. Required accessible parking spaces are
included in the total number of required parking spaces per §
156.E.004, Required Off-Street Parking.

(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.E.006 PARKING CREDITS AND REDUCTIONS.
   (A)   Generally. This section sets out several ways to reduce or receive
credit for the number of required off-street parking spaces that must be
provided according to §
156.E.004, Required Off-Street Parking.
   (B)   Administrative credits and reductions. The Zoning Administrator may
approve the following parking credit and reduction options for a property. If
such administrative reductions are proposed in a legislative review application
the presence of such reductions shall have no bearing on the recommendation or
final decision of the administrative review bodies involved. The administrative
credit and reduction options are cumulative if more than one is used on a
property.
      (1)   On-street parking credit.
         (a)   On-street parking spaces may provide credit to satisfy the
minimum parking space requirements in the nonresidential and mixed-use zoning
districts established in §
156.E.004, Required Off-Street Parking on streets designed for on-street
parking. The use of on-street parking spaces to satisfy minimum parking
requirements in no way guarantees the use of such parking spaces to customers,
employees, or visitors of the subject property.
         (b)   On-street spaces shall be located on a public or private street,
shall be available to the general public, and directly abutting the subject
property.
         (c)   Bus stops, clear zones adjacent to curb cuts, and other areas in
which parking is prohibited shall not be included in the calculation of
available on-street parking spaces.
         (d)   An on-street parking space shall be a minimum of 20 feet in
length. A minimum of 16 linear feet of an on-street parking space shall be
directly adjacent to the subject property in order to be counted as a parking
space.
      (2)   Shared parking reduction.
         (a)   Shared parking allows a reduction of up to 25% in the total
number of required parking spaces when a property is occupied by two or more
uses that typically do not experience peak use of parking areas at the same
time. When any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed in
Table 156.E.005-1, Shared Parking Table, below, the minimum total number of
required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures, which
are followed by Table 156.E.005-2, Illustrative Shared Parking Credit
Calculation, showing an example of how to calculate shared parking reductions.
            1.   Determine the minimum parking requirements for each use
category in Column (A) as if it were a separate use excluding spaces reserved
for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals (for example,
accessible spaces or spaces posted as "reserved");
            2.   Multiply the sum of required parking spaces for each use by
the corresponding percentages for each of the five time periods set forth in
Columns (B) through (F) of Table 156.E.005-1, below;
            3.   Calculate the total for each time period; and
            4.   Select the column with the highest total to find the required
number of shared spaces.

         (b)   Where a shared parking reduction is to be applied to uses on two
or more lots under different ownership, the following shall be provided to the
Zoning Administrator:
            1.   A plan that provides for interconnected parking lots and
required residential spaces to be clearly designated and separated from spaces
provided for employees, customers, and service;
            2.   Recorded easements, accepted on a form acceptable to the City
Attorney, that provide, at a minimum:
               A.   A guarantee of each owner’s rights to the use of the
parking facility;
               B.   A requirement that any termination of or amendment to the
agreement shall be subject to the approval of the city;
               C.   Cross-access among the parking areas and connections to
allow parking by the different uses anywhere on the connected properties;
               D.   Allocation of maintenance responsibilities;
               E.   A pedestrian circulation system that connects uses and
parking areas, making it easy and convenient for pedestrians to move between
uses; and
               F.   A right of enforcement by the city.
      (3)   Off-site parking credit. Off-site parking spaces may provide credit
to satisfy the minimum parking space requirements in any nonresidential or
mixed-use zoning district subject to the following:
         (a)   The off-site parking lot is within 300 feet of the subject
property, measured from the nearest property lines;
         (b)   The parking lot is wholly within a nonresidential or mixed-use
zoning district; and
         (c)   The parking lot complies with all applicable requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)   Legislative credits and reductions.
      (1)   Plan and Zoning Commission. The Plan and Zoning Commission may
approve a reduction in the number of required parking spaces if the applicant
demonstrates that a reduction is appropriate based on the applicant providing a
parking study with specific parking demand forecasts for the proposed use and/
or on the provision of alternative parking or transportation demand management
programs that tend to reduce the demand for parking spaces, provided that:
         (a)   The study is prepared by a professional transportation planner
or traffic engineer;
         (b)   The forecasts are based upon a peak parking analysis of at least
five comparable uses; and
         (c)   The comparability of the uses is documented in detail, including
their location, gross floor area, street access, use types and restrictions,
hours of operation, peak parking demand periods, and all other factors that
could affect parking demand.
      (2)   Transportation professional. The Zoning Administrator may retain a
qualified transportation planner or traffic engineer, at the applicant's
expense, to review the parking demand forecast and provide recommendations to
the Plan and Zoning Commission.
      (3)   Reserve. The balance of the land necessary to meet the parking
requirements shall be held in reserve as an undeveloped area, to meet any
future needs generated by an expansion of the business, a change in land use,
or underestimated parking demand.

Table Notes:
N/A = Not Applicable
1Refer to overall groupings of the uses in the Use Table in § 156.C.003 (for
example, Agricultural, Residential, etc).
 
   (C)   Design. To minimize impacts, off-street loading areas shall comply
with the following standards:
      (1)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street loading or
unloading areas may not glare on any right-of-way or adjacent property.
      (2)   Location. Not be located within 40 feet of the nearest point of
intersection of any two streets with no loading dock visible from a
thoroughfare or collector street right-of-way;
      (3)   Buffering. Docks and loading spaces shall be located behind
buildings and screened from view from abutting properties and public right-of-
way. Truck access and loading areas that are located between a principal
building and a residential property shall comply with the following additional
standards:
         (a)   Use of enclosed loading. The loading area shall be enclosed by a
roof and a wall between the principal building and the property boundary line
(as depicted in
Figure 156.E.007-1, Illustrative Example of Enclosed Loading, below). The walls
of the enclosure shall be tall enough to completely screen the delivery vehicle
and shall be designed and constructed with architectural elements such as
windows, awnings, or other features that complement the exterior of the
principal building. The portion of the bufferyard between the enclosed loading
and the property line may be reduced by one level of opacity with the remainder
of the bufferyard being the opacity level required by Table 156.F.004-1,
Bufferyard Types, for the applicable zoning district; or
         (b)   Absence of enclosed loading. The loading area shall be screened
along its length by a district bufferyard that has one additional level of
opacity (for example, from a Type B bufferyard to a Type C bufferyard) than
required by Table 156.F.004-1 and, additionally, the loading area shall contain
an eight-foot-tall masonry wall that is designed and constructed with the same
primary exterior finish materials of the principal building.

   (D)   Types of loading spaces.
      (1)   Loading for industrial uses. Each required loading space in the GI,
General Industrial zoning district shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width and
45 feet in depth.
      (2)   Other uses. All other required loading spaces shall be a minimum of
12 feet in width and 18 feet in depth. All required loading spaces shall have a
minimum vertical clearance of 15 feet and shall be designated by signs as
loading spaces.
   (E)   Mixed-use developments. Where mixed-use developments may be adequately
and conveniently served by a common loading area, the Zoning Administrator may
approve a reduction in spaces required in Table 156.E.007-1, Minimum Off-Street
Loading Spaces Required. For this purpose, the minimum number of required
spaces shall be based on the use category having the greatest number of
resulting spaces.
   (F)   Outdoor storage. For the purposes of this section, each two square
feet of exterior area used for outdoor storage shall be considered equivalent
to one square foot of enclosed gross floor area.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.E.008 OFF-STREET STACKING.
   (A)   Generally. Stacking spaces create capacity of a drive-through lane to
hold vehicles while transactions are taking place at drive-through facilities.
Stacking spaces are nine feet in width by 20 feet in length and provide direct
access to a service window or other improvement. The position in front of a
drive-through station (e.g., a service window, ATM, or station at a drive-
through bank) is counted as a stacking space.
   (B)   Requirements.
      (1)   Minimum number. Uses that include drive-through service shall not
have fewer than the number of stacking spaces established in Table 156.E.008,
Stacking Requirements.
      (2)   Bypass lane. A ten-foot-wide bypass lane is required adjacent to
stacking lanes to allow vehicles to travel around the drive-through activity
and exit the site or park.
      (3)   Turn-around area. Controlled entrances shall be designed so that
vehicles may turn around without entering the gated area or backing out into
the public right-of-way.

§ 156.F.003 DEVELOPMENT LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Applicability. Site landscaping is required around multiple-family
buildings, civic, institutional, commercial office and retail, industrial, and
mixed-use buildings.
      (2)   Planting requirements. The required number of overstory and
understory trees and shrubs or ornamental grasses as set out in the respective
zoning district.
   (B)   Off-street parking, driveways, and loading areas.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Landscape plan required. A landscape plan for all parking lots
regardless of size shall be prepared and submitted to the city for review and
approval for any landscaping, buffer, or screening required by the city.
         (b)   Preparation of landscape plan. To encourage landscape plans to
be thoughtfully arranged so site elements are artfully and technically
organized in a way that conveys meaning, coherence, and spatial organization, a
qualified individual or organization, as acceptable to the Zoning
Administrator, shall prepare the landscape plan.
         (c)   Landscape plan contents. All landscape plans are subject to the
contents set forth in the site plan procedures in §
156.J.004, Administrative Review Procedures.
      (2)   Parking lot design.
         (a)   All rows of parking that exceed 20 stalls in length shall be
terminated with a curbed landscaped island that is a minimum nine feet wide and
no less than 16 feet in length (32 feet in length for head-to-head parking
stalls).
         (b)   Off-street parking lots that exceed 100 stalls shall require no
parking or loading area shall be more than 100 feet from a tree located within
a landscaped open space area.
         (c)   Sidewalks that abut the front edge of any parking stall shall be
no less than seven feet wide to accommodate a two feet vehicle overhang.
      (3)   Sidewalk requirement. Every parking lot of more than 100 spaces
shall have at least one pedestrian walkway.
      (4)   Landscaping required. All parking lot islands shall be landscaped
with turf grass, ornamental grass plantings, plant beds, shrubs, trees, rock,
and/or chip brick. The use of pavers in an island shall only be used in
combination with plant-scaping materials. Sidewalks may be constructed within a
parking lot island as necessary to accommodate pedestrian circulation. See
Figure 156.F.003-1, Off-Street Parking, Driveways, and Loading Areas. See
Figure 156.F.003-1, Off-Street Parking, Driveways, and Loading Areas.

shall be planted every 75 feet within the parking lot setback area. In areas of
public utility easement, no trees are required but the screening material must
incorporate plant-scaping. Additionally, a minimum three-foot-tall screen shall
be installed between the parking lot and the adjoining street along the entire
frontage in accordance with minimum visibility requirements at intersections,
driveways, and alleys. This screen can be constructed with any combination of
ornamental grasses, shrubs, earth berming, low masonry walls, and decorative
fencing. Shrubs and ornamental grasses shall have a mature height of at least
three feet.
      (6)   Parking lot setback. The parking lot setback shall be a minimum
width of five feet.

         (a)   A minimum of five overstory trees per acre shall be required.
         (b)   Unless otherwise approved by the city, required trees shall not
be located within the street right-of-way, between the edge of the public
street and any sidewalk or trail. The trees shall be shown on a landscaping
plan provided to the Zoning Administrator. The tree planting plan shall include
the location, size, and species of all street trees being proposed.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.F.004 BUFFERING.
   (A)   Generally. The bufferyards required in this section provide transition
and physical barriers between properties of differing land uses to reduce the
effects of sight, sound, and other incompatibilities. The bufferyards are based
on the amount of screening they provide, which are classified from less
screening (Type A) to more screening (Type C), depending on the types and
intensities of adjoining land uses.
   (B)   General standards.
      (1)   Groundcover. In addition to the required plantings, walls, fences,
and berms, remaining portions of all bufferyards shall contain groundcover.
      (2)   Plant groupings. Bufferyard plantings may be located in small
groupings to appear more natural or evenly spaced.
      (3)   Earthen berms. Earthen berms within a bufferyard may vary and
undulate to accommodate drainage and to provide a more natural appearance.
Incorporation of a berm into a buffer yard may necessitate an increase in width
of the bufferyard beyond what is required in Table 156.F.004-1, Bufferyard
Classifications.
      (4)   Encroachment. No part of any required bufferyard shall be used for
structures, parking, storage, loading, locating refuse containers, or any
similar activity which may create a nuisance.
      (5)   Extent. All required bufferyards shall be located on the parcel
proposed for development.
      (6)   Access breaks. Breaks for pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle access
are permitted on the condition that access shall be designed to cross a
bufferyard at as near a perpendicular angle as practical.
      (7)   Low impact development. Low impact development and other similar
stormwater management features are permitted in a required bufferyard.
   (C)   Bufferyard types. There are three types of bufferyards, each of which
varies in width and the numbers and types of plants required per 100 linear
feet. The minimum planting requirements for each type of bufferyard are set out
in Table 156.F.004-1, Bufferyard Classifications, except that parking lot
setback plantings are set out in §
156.F.003, Development Landscaping. Illustrative examples of bufferyards are in
Figure 156.F.003-1, Illustrative Bufferyard Types.

   (D)   Bufferyard locations. Bufferyards shall be established within a
bufferyard easement on individual lots or parcels, unless a property owners'
association is established in which case bufferyards may be within common open
space. Properties separated by the public street right-of-way are not
considered adjoining for the purposes of this section. Bufferyards shall be
required as follows:
      (1)   Between zoning districts. The type of required bufferyard between
two adjoining zoning districts or use category in the GI zoning district, with
the type determined by the intensities of the districts.
Table 156.F.004-2, District Bufferyard Standards, establishes the required
bufferyard type between the zoning district of the parcel proposed for
development and the zoning of the abutting district. Where "--" is found there
is no bufferyard required.

Table Notes:
1See §
156.C.003, Use Table, and associated specific uses and use categories as
defined in §
156.M.003, Definitions.
 
      (2)   Along corner and rear yards abutting collector and arterial
streets. When a corner or rear yard of a lot zoned RM, RH, MU, UC, GC, PI, or
REC abuts collector and arterial street right-of-way, a Type B bufferyard is
required. A Type C bufferyard is required for uses in the GI district.
      (3)   Single-family residential through (double frontage) lots. Any
single-family detached or attached residential lot having both its front and
rear lot lines abutting a public street, private street, or interstate highway
(a double frontage lot) or a corner lot which is adjacent to a double frontage
lot shall be required to have a Type C bufferyard along that corresponding rear
or side yard lot line. The rear yard and front side yard building setbacks
shall be measured from the farthest extent of the bufferyard.
      (4)   Adjacent to agricultural land. A Type A bufferyard is required for
a parcel proposed for development when adjoining agricultural land that is not
planned for development. At the time of development, unless no bufferyard is
required, the adjoining property would also be required to provide the
bufferyard required in
Table 156.F.004-2, District Bufferyard Standards.
      (5)   Along a natural resource feature, park, or recreation area.
Development must meet applicable city codes related to stream/riparian
protection.
      (6)   Adjacent to public streets. Refer to the requirements for trees and
parking lot screening in §
156.F.003, Development Landscaping.
   (E)   Natural area exemption. A parcel that would typically require
bufferyards may be exempt from the requirement to provide bufferyards where the
parcel is separated from the adjacent property by a natural area that meets or
exceeds the number of plantings required by the applicable bufferyard. Natural
areas shall be exempt from the shrub requirement.
   (F)   Warranted exceptions of bufferyard requirements. Should a bufferyard
requirement overburden a property by making development impractical, in the
sole discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the width of a required buffer may
be reduced, and a privacy fence, screen wall, or other measures may be used to
mitigate the impact on the property to be buffered.
   (G)   Credits for existing landscaping improvements.
      (1)   Generally. Existing trees, fences, and landscape or retaining walls
that meet, in part but not in whole, the bufferyard requirements set out
herein, may be counted toward a bufferyard requirement, provided that the trees
and landscaping are in good health or the fences or walls are structurally
sound.
      (2)   Existing landscaping credit. Credit shall be given for existing
trees and landscaping within bufferyards and perimeter yards.
   (H)   Relationship to other bufferyard requirements. Some limited or special
uses may have different requirements for bufferyards, as specified in §
156.C.004, Limited Use Standards, and §
156.C.005, Special Use Standards. If bufferyards are required by another
section of this Zoning Ordinance along property boundaries that are also
district boundaries, then the most restrictive bufferyard requirement is
required.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.F.005 SCREENING.
   (A)   Generally. This section provides screening standards, including fences
and walls, for the separation of adjoining residential and nonresidential land
uses and screening standards for mechanical equipment, outdoor storage, and
refuse containers.
   (B)   Refuse containers.
      (1)   Refuse containers, including dumpsters, shall be screened on all
sides by the use of a permanent enclosure, with gates for disposal truck
access. The enclosure shall be constructed to visibly screen the receptacle
from public view and from adjoining properties. The design of the pedestrian
access to the receptacle or dumpster shall be designed to minimize the view
into the enclosure.
      (2)   The enclosure shall be landscaped to minimize the visual impact of
the enclosure on surrounding properties and public thoroughfares.
   (C)   Mechanical equipment.
      (1)   Overhead utilities. All electrical lines less than 30,000 volts
must be placed underground, unless a utility provider determines that
underground utilities are a safety hazard or impractical in which case this
requirement may be waived by the Plan and Zoning Commission.
      (2)   Ground-mounted. For all new development or redevelopment, all
ground-mounted mechanical equipment, including, but not limited to, air-
conditioning condensers, heat pumps, ventilation units, computer cooling
equipment, and any other related utility structures and equipment that are
visible from any adjacent public thoroughfare shall be visibly screened from
public view by the use of one of the following approaches:
         (a)   A screening wall built of materials compatible and consistent
with the materials of the principal building;
         (b)   Landscape plantings of predominantly evergreen type trees and
shrubs to provide year-round screening;
         (c)   Fencing that has at least 80% opacity;
         (d)   Permanent earth-berming; or
         (e)   A combination of the above.
      (3)   Roof-mounted. Equipment must be 100% screened from ground level
views at all property lines by structural improvements such as:
         (a)   Parapet walls with cornice treatments;
         (b)   Screening walls constructed of materials consistent with the
principal building; or
         (c)   Sloped-roof systems or other architectural elements.

erection, the permit number, the name of the sign manufacturer and installer,
and the voltage of any electrical apparatus used.
      (2)   Anchoring. Signs shall not be suspended by chains or other devices
that will allow the sign to swing, due to wind action. Signs shall be anchored
to prevent any lateral movement that could cause wear on supporting members or
connections.
      (3)   Supports. Supports and braces shall be an integral part of the sign
design. Angle irons or wires used for supports or braces shall be hidden from
public view to the extent technically feasible.
      (4)   Freestanding signs. Freestanding signs shall be self-supporting

      (5)   Attached signs. Attached signs must derive their principle and
total support from the building to which they are attached.
      (6)   Use of fill under monument signs. Mounds or berms may be used to
elevate permanent monument signs, provided that the mound or berm elevates the
base of the sign not more than three feet above the natural grade at the
location of the sign.
      (7)   Electrical switch. The sign shall be equipped with a switch that
prevents electricity from flowing to the sign in order to promote safety during
maintenance.
      (8)   Inspection request. After any sign requiring a permit is
constructed or erected, the sign contractor performing the work or service
shall notify the Building Official for final inspection of the sign.
   (B)   Inspection. The Building Official or Zoning Administrator has the
right to visit any site where a sign is erected or is being erected, installed,
converted, relocated, enlarged, or modified in the city for the purpose of
making any inspection necessary.
      (1)   If the Zoning Administrator finds a sign to be non-conforming, the
Zoning Administrator shall cause notice in writing to be given the owner of the
sign or the owner of the building to which it is attached to at once remove the
sign.
      (2)   If such owner neglects or fails to comply therewith, the Building
Official or Zoning Administrator may cause the sign to be removed and the
expense thereof to be assessed against the owner of the building or sign and
collected as other special taxes.
      (3)   Anyone violating any of the provisions of this subchapter shall be
subject to a fine that shall be set by resolution.
      (4)   Any fines issued or actions taken by the Zoning Administrator under
this subsection may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment, whose decision is
subject to judicial review pursuant to I.C.A. § 414.15. Removal of a sign shall
be stayed during such appeal unless the sign presents a danger to public
safety.
   (C)   Maintenance. Signs that do not have a permit, or are not maintained as
set out in this section, are subject to the provisions set out in this
division.
      (1)   Message. Signs shall display messages. Signs that do not display a
message for a period of more than 90 days are "abandoned signs," which are
prohibited subject to § 156.G.003, Prohibited Signs.
      (2)   Upkeep of ground around sign. The area within a ten-foot radius of
the base of a sign shall be kept free of weeds, rubbish, or flammable waste or
material.
      (3)   Supports and other hardware. Structural supports, braces, bolds,
clips, supporting frames and fastenings of a sign shall be kept in good repair
and safe condition, including replacement of defective parts, so that the sign
is securely fastened or anchored to a building wall, structural framing, or
other foundation.
      (4)   Paint and finishes. Paint and other finishes shall be maintained in
good condition. Peeling finishes shall be repaired. Signs with running colors
shall be repainted, repaired, removed, or replaced if the running colors were
not part of the original design.
      (5)   Corrosion and rust. Permanent signs and sign structures shall be
finished and maintained to prevent corrosion and rust. A patina on copper
elements is not considered rust.
      (6)   Level position. Signs that are designed to be level shall be
installed and maintained in a level position.
      (7)   Materials. All signs shall be constructed of durable materials and
securely attached to framework, with supports made of masonry, wood, metal, or
other material of equivalent strength.

decorative lighting.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.H.003 LIGHT SOURCES.
   (A)   Generally. All lighting shall be shielded so the source of
illumination (bulb or direct lamp image) is not visible from the property line.
This reduces glare and interference with boundary streets and adjacent
properties. No lamp shall extend past the housing of a light fixture.
   (B)   Light fixture type.
      (1)   Light fixtures shall be:

            1.   Be of excessive brightness;
            2.   Cause glare hazardous to pedestrians or drivers;
            3.   Create any public or private nuisance; or
            4.   Unreasonably interfere with an adjacent property owner's right
to enjoy their property.
      (2)   "No cut-off" fixtures, may be used only for decorative purposes,
provided:
         (a)   They have light fixtures that produce no more than 1,500 lumens
(approximately equal to a 100-watt incandescent bulb);
         (b)   They use energy-efficient bulbs, such as light-emitting diode
(LED) or compact fluorescent (CFL).

ARTICLE J - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES
§ 156.J.001 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
Subsec. 156.J.001.1 Purpose.
   The purpose of this article is to consolidate and standardize the city's
development review procedures.
Subsec. 156.J.001.2 Applicability.
   (A)   Generally. The sections of this article apply to all development
activity that requires a recommendation or final decision from city staff or a
council, commission, or board denoted in Article I, Development Review Bodies.
   (B)   Types of procedures. There are three types of development procedures
applicable to this Zoning Ordinance, including:
      (1)   Legislative. An application recommended by a commission, board, or
staff that requires public notice and a hearing, and a final decision by the
City Council is a legislative action.
      (2)   Administrative. These applications are decided by the Zoning
Administrator where no public notice or hearing is required. The decision is
made using clear and objective standards or approval criteria where no limited
discretion is necessary.
      (3)   Quasi-judicial. The Board of Adjustment (Board) reviews
applications for special use permits, appeals of administrative decisions,
variances, determines findings of fact, and may then approve, approve with
conditions, or deny an application. The decision of the Board is final and
subject only to appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   Sequence of development approval. Where more than one development
review application is required by this Zoning Ordinance in order to initiate,
continue, or complete a development on the same property, development review
bodies shall make final decisions in the following sequence. A development
review body shall make final decisions on:
      (1)   Legislative applications prior to final decisions on all other
applications;
      (2)   Quasi-judicial applications prior to final decisions on subdivision
or administrative applications; and
      (3)   Applications within the same category as Table 156.J.002.12-1,
Development Review Summary Table, assigns priority.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.J.002 COMMON REVIEW PROCEDURES.
Subsec. 156.J.002.1 Pre-Application Conference.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a pre-application conference is to familiarize
the applicant with the submittal requirements and review procedures, including
all applicable standards and any known constraints, hazards, or special
conditions associated with the subject property.
   (B)   Applications requiring a pre-application conference. 
Table 156.J.002.12-2, Review Steps, denotes the development review applications
that require a pre-application conference.
   (C)   Scheduling. The conference shall be scheduled at least 15 days before
an application is due.
   (D)   Sketch plan. The applicant may submit a sketch plan as a basis for
discussion prior to or at the pre-application conference. The sketch plan shall
be of sufficient detail to accurately convey the concept, character, location,
parcel size, and the size and scale of the proposed development. The applicant
may submit additional materials at his or her discretion.
   (E)   Requested submittals. At or following the pre-application conference,
the Zoning Administrator may request that the applicant provide additional
materials at the time of application submittal as may be necessary to permit
the informed exercise of judgment under the decision criteria for the
application.
   (F)   Disclaimer. Outcomes of the pre-application conference shall not
imply, in whole or in part, any final decision on the application.
   (G)   Continuing review process. After the pre-application conference has
occurred, applications that require such conference may subsequently undergo
the processes established in Subsec. 156.J.002.3, Application Completeness.
Subsec. 156.J.002.2 Application and Fees.
   (A)   Applications and fees. Every development review application required
by this Zoning Ordinance shall be submitted in a format and with contents
established by the Zoning Administrator and shall include the corresponding
application fee that is established by the city Council.

district, or other public-sector entity that provides services to the property.
   (E)   Representation of facts. It is unlawful for any person to knowingly or
willfully misrepresent or fail to include any information required by this
Zoning Ordinance on any application. If development is approved upon an
application that contains misrepresentations or fails to contain material facts
required by the application, then the city shall place a stay or stop-work

final decision from the applicable administrative body; or
      (3)   The contents of the submittal are accurate or that they comply with
the standards of this Zoning Ordinance.

Administrator may refer the application to agencies again if the changes
substantially affect the interests of the agency in ways not anticipated by the
agency's original comments, or require the agency's technical expertise for
appropriate review.
   (D)   Administrative recommendation or decision. Promptly after submittal of
a complete application that addresses the comments (or, after finding that no
revisions are required):
      (1)   Administrative applications. If the application is for a review

conditionally approve, or deny the application, as appropriate. Applications
receiving approval may subsequently undergo the processes established in
Subsec. 156.J.002.10, Inactive or Expired Applications.
      (2)   Legislative and quasi-judicial applications. If, according to
Table 156.J.002.12-2, the application requires a public meeting or public
hearing prior to a final decision, then the applicable city staff member shall
forward a recommendation to the next administrative body who will consider it
for further recommendation or final decision.

particular requirement would create an unnecessary hardship by preventing the
use and development of land in a reasonable manner that is otherwise allowed
under this Zoning Ordinance.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   No increase in flood level. No floodplain variance shall be granted
for any development within any designated floodway which would result in any
increase in the 100-year level. Consideration of the effects of any development
on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of
development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
      (2)   Lower flood protection. In cases where the floodplain variance
involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is
ordinarily required by this ZO, the applicant shall be notified in writing over
the signature of the Floodplain Administrator that:
         (a)   The issuance of a floodplain variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for every $100
of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction increases risks to life and property.
   (C)   Review criteria.

within any designated floodway if any increase in base flood elevation would
result;
         (b)   One-half acre or less. Variances may be issued for new
construction and substantial improvements on lots of one-half acre or less
which are contiguous to, and surrounded by, existing development constructed
below the base flood elevation, provided:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, or conflict with this Zoning
Ordinance or the other ordinances in the city's Code of Ordinances.
         (c)   Minimum necessary relief. Variances shall only be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief
considering the flood hazard.
      (2)   Affirmative findings. In order to approve a variance, the final
decision-making body shall make affirmative findings on all of the applicable
decision criteria.
   (D)   Procedures.
      (1)   Obligation of applicant. It is the obligation of an applicant, who
bears the burden of proof, to present facts about the circumstances which would
justify a variance in a convincing fashion so that the Floodplain Administrator
may be satisfied that the request meets or exceeds the applicable review
criteria described in division (C), above.
      (2)   Review and decision. The Floodplain Administrator shall review and
render judgment on requests for floodplain variances.
      (3)   Alleged error. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and render
judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in
the enforcement or administration of the requirements of §
156.C.006, Flood Hazard Districts Standards, in accordance with Subsec.
156.J.005.3, Appeal of Administrative Decision.
      (4)   Time frame. Approval of a floodplain variance shall be valid for
the period of time set out in Table
Table 156.J.002.12-1, Development Review Summary Table. Thereafter, the permit
shall expire or be granted an extension as set out in Subsec.
156.J.002.10, Inactive and Expired Applications, and Subsec.
156.J.002.11, Approval Extension.
      (5)   Notice of decision. The Zoning Administrator shall provide a copy
of the decision to the applicant within ten days of the rendered judgment.
   (E)   Effect of approval.
      (1)   Particular variation. Issuance of a variance shall authorize only
the particular variation that is approved in the variance request. A variance
shall run with the land and not be affected by a change in ownership.
      (2)   Other approvals. Development authorized by the variance shall not
be carried out until the applicant has secured all other development approvals
required by this ZO. Approval of a variance does not guarantee that the
development shall receive subsequent approval for other development review
applications unless the relevant and applicable portions of this Zoning
Ordinance or any other applicable provisions are met.

permit.
      (2)   Public notice and public hearing. The required public notice and
public hearing as denoted in
Table 156.J.002.12-2, Review Steps, shall be conducted in conformance with the
procedures set out in Subsec.
156.J.002.6, Public Notice, and Subsec.
156.J.002.7, Public Meetings and Hearings.
      (3)   Time frame. Approval of a special use permit shall be valid for the
period of time set out in
Table 156.J.002.12-1, Development Review Summary Table. Thereafter, the permit
shall expire or be granted an extension as set out in Subsec.
156.J.002.10, Inactive and Expired Applications, and Subsec.
156.J.002.11, Approval Extension.
      (4)   Notice of decision. The Zoning Administrator shall provide a copy
of the decision to the applicant within ten days of the BOA's decision.
   (E)   Effect of approval. The issuance of a special use permit shall not
authorize the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving
of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation,
filing, and processing of an application for any permits or approvals which may
be required by the city, including, but not limited to, a building permit,
certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
Subsec. 156.J.005.2 Variance.
   (A)   Generally. A variance provides a means by which relief may be granted
from unforeseen applications of this Zoning Ordinance that create unnecessary
hardships or practical difficulties.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   When required. A variance is required to approve a deviation from
the standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Prohibitions and exceptions. Some requests for relief are not
within the jurisdiction of the Board, and are therefore, either prohibited or
not subject to this section. The prohibited requests are:
         (a)   Use. Variances that would allow a use in a district in which the
use is prohibited or which would constitute a change in district boundaries;
         (b)   Limited use or special use. Variances that would modify any
requirements that are set out in §
156.C.004, Limited Use Standards and §
156.C.005, Special Use Standards;
         (c)   Nonconformities. Variances that would have the effect of making
existing nonconforming structures, site improvements, parking, or landscaping
conforming;
         (d)   Conditions of approval. Variances from the terms of one or more
conditions of approval imposed by a development review body described in
Article I, Development Review Bodies. Modifications to conditions of approval
shall be sought from the body that granted the approval.
         (e)   City's Code of Ordinances. Variances that would modify any
requirements within the city's Codes of Ordinance, including but not limited to
the Building Code.
         (f)   Other laws or regulations. Variances to state or federal laws
are prohibited unless such authority is expressly granted to the city.
   (C)   Review criteria.
      (1)   Generally. In determining whether to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the
provisions of Subsec.
156.J.002.5, Common Review Criteria, together with the following:
         (a)   Not self imposed. The granting of the variance is not based on a
hardship which is self-imposed;
         (b)   Not based on cost. The hardship is not based solely on the cost
of complying with the regulation, but is based on the particular physical
surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the subject property;
         (c)   Unique circumstances. The hardship is based on circumstances
that are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and not
circumstances common to other properties;
         (d)   Minimum necessary relief. The variance requested is the minimum
necessary that will make possible a permitted use of the land, building, or
structure;
         (e)   Commonly enjoyed rights. A literal interpretation of the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights
commonly enjoyed by other residents of the district in which the property is
located; and
         (f)   Not a special privilege. Granting the variance will not confer
on the applicant any special privilege that is denied to other lands or
structures in the same district.
      (2)   Affirmative findings. In order to approve a variance, the Board of
Adjustment shall make affirmative findings on all of the applicable decision
criteria.
   (D)   Procedures.
      (1)   Obligation of applicant. It is the obligation of an applicant, who
bears the burden of proof, to present facts about the circumstances which would
justify a variance in a convincing fashion so that the BOA may be satisfied
that the request meets or exceeds the applicable review criteria described in
division (C), above.
      (2)   Review and decision. The Zoning Administrator shall review and make
a recommendation on the variance application to the BOA, who shall subsequently
conduct a public hearing before making final action to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the variance.
      (3)   Public notice and public hearing. The required public notice and
public hearing as denoted
in
Table 156.J.002.12-2, Review Steps, shall be conducted in conformance with the
procedures set out in Subsec.
156.J.002.6, Public Notice, and Subsec. 156.J.002.7, Public Meetings and
Hearings.
      (4)   Time frame. Approval of a variance shall be valid for the period of
time set out in
Table 156.J.002.12-1, Development Review Summary Table. Thereafter, the permit
shall expire or be granted an extension as set out in Subsec.
156.J.002.10, Inactive and Expired Applications, and Subsec.
156.J.002.11, Approval Extension.
      (5)   Notice of decision. The Zoning Administrator shall provide a copy
of the decision to the applicant within ten days of the BOA's decision.
   (E)   Effect of approval.
      (1)   Particular variation. Issuance of a variance shall authorize only
the particular variation that is approved in the variance request. A variance
shall run with the land and not be affected by a change in ownership.
      (2)   Other approvals. Development authorized by the variance shall not
be carried out until the applicant has secured all other development approvals
required by this ZO. Approval of a variance does not guarantee that the
development shall receive subsequent approval for other development review
applications unless the relevant and applicable portions of this Zoning
Ordinance or any other applicable provisions are met.
Subsec. 156.J.005.3 Appeal of Administrative Decision.
   (A)   Generally. An appeal of an administrative decision provides a vehicle
for appeal of any final decision of the Zoning Administrator, Building
Official, or Floodplain Administrator on an application set out in §
156.J.004, Administrative Review Procedures.
   (B)   Applicability. An application for an appeal may be submitted when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by an administrative official in the administration of this
ZO, which is not subject to a quasi-judicial or appeal process by any other
board or the PZC or City Council.
   (C)   Review criteria.
      (1)   Generally. The BOA may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the requirement, decision or determination of an administrative official
and, to that end, shall have all of the powers of the administrative official
from whom the appeal is taken. The appeal shall specifically indicate which
approval criteria are the basis for the appeal.
      (2)   New evidence. The BOA shall not consider new evidence that was not
available to the administrative official.
      (3)   All decisions. An appeal of an administrative decision may be
reversed or affirmed, in whole or in part, or modified based on findings by the
BOA making the final decision that:
         (a)   The administrative decision was appropriate considering the
written record of the case and the evidence presented; and
         (b)   The decision reflects the requirements contained in this ZO.
   (D)   Procedures.
      (1)   Notice of appeal. Within 30 calendar days from the date of a final
decision of an administrative official, an application for an appeal may be
submitted, in writing, by any person aggrieved by a decision or by any official
or department of the city affected by the decision. In the notice, the
appellant (applicant) shall set out all grounds for the appeal. In no event
shall the appeal be heard later than 60 days after the submittal of a complete
application.
      (2)   Burden of proof. The BOA shall presume the appealed final decision
to be valid. The appellant (applicant) shall present sufficient evidence and
have the burden to justify a reversal or modification of the decision being
appealed.
      (3)   Public notice and public hearing. The BOA shall conduct one or more
public hearings, as necessary, to receive evidence and testimony and to decide
an appeal. All public hearings and public notice required as denoted in
Table 156.J.002.12-2, Review Steps, shall be conducted in conformance with the
procedures set out in Subsec.
156.J.002.6, Public Notice, and Subsec.
156.J.002.7, Public Meetings and Hearings.
      (4)   Vote. The concurring vote of three members of the BOA shall be
necessary to reverse or modify the requirement, decision or determination
subject to the appeal.
      (5)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal from an order, requirement, decision
or determination shall stay all proceedings unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property.
   (E)   Effect of approval.
      (1)   Final decision. The BOA shall have the final decision-making powers
of the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
      (2)   No variance. A decision on an appeal of an administrative decision
cannot grant or issue a variance.
      (3)   Flood boundary. A decision may support, reverse or remand an order
or determination of a boundary of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
ARTICLE K - NONCONFORMITIES
§ 156.K.001 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Generally. This article sets out equitable rules for the continuing
use, occupation, and conversion of nonconformities. A nonconformity occurs when
existing development within the city may become affected by the application of
new regulations. This change may cause existing uses, structures, lots, signs,
and site improvements to not strictly comply with this Zoning Ordinance, even
though they complied with the regulations in effect at the time they were
permitted and constructed.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to:
      (1)   No expansion. Ensure that nonconforming uses do not expand;
      (2)   Protection. Protect conforming uses from nuisances that may be
associated with nonconformities;
      (3)   Encourage conformance. Encourage property owners of nonconformities
to alter a nonconforming use, structure, lot, sign, or site improvement into
one that complies with the standards of this Zoning Ordinance;
      (4)   Elimination. Eliminate substantially damaged or abandoned
nonconformities whose degrees of incompatibility with adjacent lands uses are
high; and
      (5)   Balance. Balance the city's objective to eliminate nonconformities
with a landowner’s right to maintain and make use of a nonconformity.
   (C)   Applicability. The regulations of this article govern uses,
structures, lots, signs, and site improvements that came into existence legally
but that do not conform to one or more requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
These are referred to as nonconformities. Nonconformities are permitted to
continue without immediate retrofit or removal until significant site or land
use changes are proposed.
   (D)   Major and minor nonconforming uses and structures. Nonconforming uses
and structures are classified as major or minor, as follows:
      (1)   Major. Major nonconforming uses or structures are those that the
Zoning Administrator finds have the following characteristics to such an extent
that they should, over time, be eliminated:
         (a)   Generation of nuisances;
         (b)   Incompatibility with adjacent properties;
         (c)   Incompatibility with the Comprehensive Plan; or
         (d)   Generation of substantiated criminal complaints.
      (2)   Minor. Minor nonconforming uses or structures are those not
classified as major nonconformities.
      (3)   Conversion. Refer to §
156.K.007, Conversion of Nonconformities, for provisions related to changing a
minor nonconformity to a conforming use or structure.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.K.002 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Generally. A nonconforming use is a use of land that was lawfully
established (e.g., it was allowed and issued a permit, if a permit was required
at the time the use was established) on a parcel or lot before the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance, that is no longer allowed after the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance. Amendments to this Zoning Ordinance may also
create nonconforming uses. The following uses are nonconforming uses:
      (1)   "Limited uses" as listed in the Use Table established in §
156.C.003, Use Table, but were lawfully established without a limited use
permit. For these uses, the nonconforming use status may be removed by
obtaining a limited use permit set out in Subsec.
156.J.004.9, Limited Use Permits;
      (2)   Uses that do not meet the requirements of Article C, Use Standards;
and
      (3)   Uses that were lawfully established within a floodplain or
floodway, but are no longer permitted in the floodplain or floodway.
   (B)   Classifications of nonconforming uses. There are two types of
nonconforming uses: major nonconforming uses and minor nonconforming uses. The
classification of the nonconforming use affects whether or not it can be
converted to a conforming use.
      (1)   Major nonconforming uses.
         (a)   Discontinuance. Discontinuance of a major nonconforming use for
a period of six consecutive months constitutes abandonment of the use,
regardless of the owner’s intent. A major nonconforming use shall not be re-
established on the property after it is abandoned unless the City Council
approves a zone change in accordance with Subsec.
156.J.003.2 that makes the prior use conforming.
         (b)   Expansion, enlargement, or increases. A major nonconforming use
shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, increased, or moved to occupy an
area of land or building that was not used or occupied on the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment that made the use nonconforming.
         (c)   Structures. No structures containing a major nonconforming use
shall be enlarged unless the major nonconforming use is permanently
discontinued.
      (2)   Minor nonconforming uses.
         (a)   Discontinuance. Discontinuance of a minor nonconforming use for
a period of 12 consecutive months constitutes abandonment of the use,
regardless of the owner's intent. A minor nonconforming use shall not be re-
established on the property after it is abandoned unless the property owner
converts the nonconforming use to a conforming use in accordance with §
156.K.007, Conversion of Nonconformities, prior to the end of the 12-month
period.
         (b)   Expansion and/or extension. No minor nonconforming use shall be
expanded or extended in such a way as to:
            1.   Occupy any open space or landscaped area that is required by
this Zoning Ordinance;
            2.   Exceed pervious cover, intensity, or height limitations of the
zoning district in which the use is located;
            3.   Occupy any land beyond the boundaries of the property as it
existed on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance;
            4.   Displace any conforming use in the same building or on the
same property; or
            5.   Increase the area of floodplain (if present) that is directly
impacted by the use.
         (c)   Nonconforming residential uses. A nonconforming residential use
shall not be expanded in scope or area, except that construction of an attached
or free-standing private garage is allowed in accordance with the requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance and the district in which the use is located,
including, but not limited to:
            1.   Height;
            2.   Setback;
            3.   Gross floor area; and
            4.   Building coverage.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.K.003 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Generally. A building or structure is classified as nonconforming if
it was lawfully constructed before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance
(or amendment hereto) and does not conform to the height, yard, density,
intensity, building scale, or design standards that are applicable to the same
type of building or structure in the zoning district in which the building or
structure is located. Such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Increase in nonconformity prohibited. No such structure may be
enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.
      (2)   Movement of structure. Should any on-site structure, in whole or in
part, be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located after
it is moved.
      (3)   Minimum floor area. A residential dwelling unit having a lesser
floor area at the time of the passage of this Zoning Ordinance than the minimum
floor area required for the district in which it is located shall not be
construed to be nonconforming.
   (B)   Repairs and alterations. Routine maintenance, including necessary non-
structural repairs, paint, finish, and incidental alterations to a
nonconforming structure is allowed without having to bring the nonconformity
into compliance.
   (C)   Damage and reconstruction. If a major or minor nonconforming structure
is damaged, partially destroyed, or deemed to be unsafe the structure may be
restored to its original dimensions provided that:
      (1)   The original nonconformity is not enlarged, increased, or extended;
      (2)   A building permit is obtained for repairs within six months of the
date the building was damaged;
      (3)   For a major nonconforming structure, the construction is commenced
within six months after obtaining the required building permits;
      (4)   For a minor nonconforming structure, the construction is commenced
within 12 months after obtaining the required building permits;
      (5)   For a major nonconforming structure, the damage or destruction does
not exceed 50% of the gross floor area (GFA) of a nonconforming structure or
50% of the replacement cost of the structure; and
      (6)   For a minor nonconforming structure, the damage or destruction does
not exceed 75% of the GFA of a nonconforming structure or 75% of the
replacement cost of the structure.
   (D)   Existing nonconforming structures in a regulated floodplain or
floodway. It is the intent of the city that no permanent buildings or
structures be located or substantially improved in a regulated floodplain or
floodway and that existing nonconforming structures shall be removed upon
abandonment. As such, a property with an abandoned nonconforming structure in a
regulated floodplain or floodway shall not be eligible for any development
review approval until the property owner removes the abandoned nonconforming
structure.
   (E)   Nonconforming density. Buildings on lots with nonconforming density
may be expanded or extended as may be allowed by this Zoning Ordinance, but
such expansions or extensions shall not create additional dwelling units.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.K.004 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Generally. A nonconforming lot is a lot that was lawfully created
before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or amendments this Zoning
Ordinance that no longer complies with the lot width, lot area, or access
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (B)   Combination of lots to increase conformity.
      (1)   Combination. Where a property owner owns one or more lots abutting
a nonconforming lot of record, the lots shall be combined to create fully
conforming lots prior to any other development application submittal for the
property. Or, if full conformity is not possible, they shall be combined if the
combination will increase the degree of conformity.
      (2)   No combination. A property owner is not required to combine lots
pursuant to division (B)(1), above, if:
         (a)   The combination of lots would not address the nonconformity;
         (b)   The combination of lots would disrupt the lot pattern of the
street, for example, by creating an internal through on a street segment that
does not include any other through lots;
         (c)   Two or more of the lots are developed with principal buildings,
and the combination of lots would require that one or more of the buildings be
torn down or the property undergo a zone change in order to comply with this
Zoning Ordinance; or
         (d)   The combination of lots would result in regularly shaped lots
being combined into a single lot with an irregular shape, such as a flag lot.
   (C)   Construction on nonconforming lots of record. A nonconforming lot of
record that cannot be combined with another lot in accordance with division (B)
of this section may be built upon if, as of the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance:
      (1)   Permitted use. The use is permitted in the zoning district in which
the lot is located;
      (2)   Sufficient width. The lot has sufficient width on a public street
to provide access that is appropriate for the proposed use; and
      (3)   Setbacks and height. All setbacks and height requirements are met,
except that the Zoning Administrator may authorize a reduction of required
setbacks of up to 10%, in accordance with Subsec.
156.J.004.7, Administrative Adjustment, provided that the Zoning Administrator
finds that the reduction does not allow a building that would be larger than a
building that would be permitted on the minimum conforming lot in the zoning
district.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.K.005 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Generally. Any permanent sign located within the city limits on the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance that does not conform to the provisions
of
Article G, Signs, is a nonconforming sign, provided it also meets the following
requirements:
      (1)   Authorized by a sign permit prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance; or
      (2)   If no sign permit was required under applicable law for the sign in
question, the sign:
         (a)   Was in all respects in conformity with the applicable law (or
there was no applicable law) immediately prior to the effective date; or
         (b)   Had legal nonconforming status at such time.
   (B)   Standards.
      (1)   Notification. If the Zoning Administrator finds a sign to be
nonconforming, the Zoning Administrator shall provide written notice to the
owner of the sign or the owner of the building to which it is attached.
      (2)   Registration. The owner or entity in control of the property on
which a nonconforming sign is located shall be required to register such signs
with the city, at no fee, and otherwise comply with all requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance relating to nonconforming signs.
      (3)   Damage or destruction. If a nonconforming sign is damaged or
destroyed by any means and the repair or reconstruction cost, whichever is
applicable, equals or exceeds 50% of the fair market value of the sign at the
time of the damage, it shall be removed or brought into compliance with this
Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   No message. If a nonconforming sign does not display any message
for a period of six months, it shall be removed or brought into conformance
with this Zoning Ordinance.
      (5)   Removal. If a nonconforming sign is removed for any reason, it
shall not be replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this Zoning
Ordinance.
      (6)   Danger. A nonconforming sign that the Building Official determines
to be a danger to public safety due to damage or wear shall be removed and
shall not be replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this Zoning
Ordinance.
      (7)   Removal of certain prohibited signs. Signs made of materials
identified in §
156.G.003(C), Prohibited Sign Elements, and placed in locations identified in §
156.G.003(D), Prohibited Sign Locations, shall be removed within 30 days after
the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (8)   New sign installation. The installation of any new sign is
prohibited on a site while a nonconforming sign remains in use.
      (9)   Temporary signs. Temporary signs that are not in compliance with §
156.G.006, Temporary Signs, shall be removed within 30 days after the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.K.006 NONCONFORMING SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Generally. A nonconforming site improvement is a development activity
on sites improved during the process of development, redevelopment, or
improvement. Over time, such development activities will have the effect of
removing the majority of nonconforming site improvements in the jurisdiction of
this Zoning Ordinance. The following site improvements are nonconforming if
there were lawfully established but do not meet the standards of
Article D, Building and Site Design Standards:
      (1)   Building exterior material or design;
      (2)   Parking, loading, or stacking areas or driveways;
      (3)   Development landscaping or bufferyards; and
      (4)   Outdoor lighting.
   (B)   Nonconforming driveway.
      (1)   Continuance. Any nonconforming driveway access is permitted to
continue as a nonconforming driveway until:
         (a)   Additional access. Any additional driveway is constructed for
the subject property or for the unified development of which it is a part; or
         (b)   Repaving or reconstruction. The driveway requires reconstruction
or repaving.
      (2)   Termination. If the criteria in this division (B), Nonconforming
Driveway, are met, the nonconforming driveway shall no longer be permissible,
and the Zoning Administrator shall require driveway access to meet the
requirements of
Article D. The Zoning Administrator may block any such nonpermissible driveways
after notice is mailed to the property owner of record.
   (C)   Other nonconforming site improvements. No other nonconforming site
improvement may be modified except to bring the site improvement into greater
compliance with the requirements on
Article D.
(Ord. 15039, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 156.K.007 CONVERSION OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide standards by which
minor nonconforming uses and structures (See §
156.K.001, Purpose and Applicability) can be made "conforming" through a public
hearing process. In many instances, minor nonconforming uses and structures are
integral parts of the city's fabric, that is, its character and function, so
their continuing existence promotes the city's policy objective of protecting
its neighborhoods. In these instances, the classification "nonconformity" and
resulting restriction on investment may not be what the community desires. As
such, the use may be made conforming pursuant to this article in order to
remove the potential stigma that may be associated with the "nonconforming"
designation.
   (B)   Procedure. An owner of a minor nonconforming use or structure may
apply for a special use permit pursuant to Subsec.
156.J.005.1, Special Use Permits, which has the effect of making the
nonconforming use or structure conforming. The criteria for limited use
approval are set out in division (D) below.
   (C)   Exclusions. This procedure does not apply to nonconforming lots, which
may be buildable in accordance with the standards for nonconforming lots set
out in §
156.J.004, Nonconforming Lots.
   (D)   Criteria for approval. A special use permit approval may be granted to
make a nonconforming building, structure, or use conforming, if, in addition to
the criteria for approval of a limited use permit set out in Subsec.
156.J.005.1, Special Use Permits, and §
156.C.005, Special Use Standards, all of the criteria of this section are
satisfied.
      (1)   Approval criteria. The use, as conducted and managed, has minimal
nonconformities and has been integrated into the neighborhood's (or zoning
district's if it is not in or adjacent to a residential neighborhood) function,
as evidenced by the following demonstrations:
         (a)   The neighborhood residents regularly patronize or are employed
at said use (for nonresidential uses in or abutting residential neighborhoods);
         (b)   Management practices eliminate nuisances such as noise, light,
waste materials, unreasonably congested on-street parking, or similar
conflicts;
         (c)   There is no material history of complaints about the use (a
history of complaints is justification for denying the conditional use permit,
unless the conditions of the permit will eliminate the sources of the
complaints); or
         (d)   The use has been maintained in good condition and its
classification as a nonconformity would be a disincentive for such maintenance.
      (2)   Conditions. The Board of Adjustment (BOA) may impose conditions
relative to the expansion of bufferyards, landscaping and landscape areas, or
other site design provisions, or other limitations necessary to ensure that, as
a conforming use, the use will not become a nuisance. Such conditions may
relate to the lot, buildings, structures, or operation of the use.
   (E)   Effect of approval. Uses that comply with the terms of a special use
permit issued in accordance with this section are converted from "legally
nonconforming uses" to "conforming uses" by virtue of the issuance of the

authority granted by I.C.A Chapter 354.
   (C)   Purpose. The general purposes of this chapter are: to carry out the
policies and goals of the Comprehensive Guide Plan (General Development Plat)
to provide for the orderly, economic and safe development of land and urban
services and facilities and to promote the public health, safety, morals and
general welfare. Further this chapter is adopted:
      (1)   To improve land records by establishing standards for surveys and
plats, and by requiring accurate legal descriptions of boundaries which will
help provide clear title;
      (2)   To prevent scattered or premature platting of lots beyond the
service areas of existing public utilities and improvements;
      (3)   To discourage platting of lots which are unbuildable or very
difficult to build on;
      (4)   To assure sound layout and to permit economy of construction in new
subdivisions;
      (5)   To secure the reservation of public lands and waters;
      (6)   To encourage attractive, stable and wholesome community growth by
providing procedures for plat review which involve checking by all appropriate
officials;
      (7)   To cause the cost of public improvements to be done by lot
purchasers rather than to permit the cost to become a burden upon existing
property owners who have already paid for their improvements; and
      (8)   To establish minimum improvement standards and design criteria.
   (D)   Geographic jurisdiction. This chapter shall regulate the subdivision
of land within the City of Marshalltown, Iowa, and all land within an area
extending two miles beyond the City Limits in accordance with the provisions of
I.C.A. § 354.9.
   (E)   Use and interpretation.
      (1)   Whenever any subdivision of land shall hereafter be laid out, the
subdivision plat and plans of proposed improvements shall, in all respects, be
in full compliance with these regulations and with the provisions of I.C.A.
Chapter 354. For purposes of this chapter, all lots or parcels created from the
division of land within a Quarter-Quarter Section on or after April 8, 1991
shall be subject to the regulations herein.
      (2)   Except as provided by State Law, until said plats and plans are
approved, properly signed and officially recorded:
         (a)   No land shall be subdivided, nor any street laid out;
         (b)   No lot or parcel of land, within any subdivision shall be
offered for sale nor shall any sales, contract for sale, or option be made or
given unless such sale, contract or option is conditional upon city approval of
the final plat;
         (c)   No permanent utility services by any public service corporation
nor public improvements shall be installed.
      (3)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements.
      (4)   Where the conditions of this chapter conflict with other laws or
Ordinances, the regulations which are more restrictive, or which impose higher
standards or requirements, shall govern.

reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and the Council. Planned unit
developments and plans for any combination of uses shall be presented in the
same manner as plats for the review of the Commission.
   (A)   Pre-application meeting.
      (1)   Prior to the submission of any plat for consideration by the
Commission under provisions of this chapter, the subdivider shall meet with
City Development Staff to introduce himself as a potential subdivider and they
shall advise the subdivider what shall be expected of him in that capacity. An
initial informal sketch of the proposed plat over a print of a topographic map
or other suitable sketch and a tentative proposed improvement list will be
required. The sketch shall also show the relationship of the land to be platted
to surrounding subdivisions. The subdivider shall familiarize himself with
provisions of the Comprehensive Plan affecting the use of his property, and he
shall satisfy himself that the zoning is appropriate for his intended use of
the property.
      (2)   The purpose of the pre-application conference is to afford the
subdivider an opportunity to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the
City Development Staff and to consult early and informally with staff before
preparation of the preliminary plat and before formal application for its
approval.
      (3)   The land which is proposed for subdivision must be zoned for the
use or uses contemplated in the proposal before the preliminary plat is filed.
   (B)   Preliminary plat.
      (1)   The subdivider shall submit to the City Clerk 16 copies of a
preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision, the requirements of which are as
set forth in this chapter. The preliminary plat shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator not less than three weeks prior to the next regularly
scheduled Planning Commission meeting and shall be accompanied by a fee of $250
plus $10 dollars for each lot payable to the City of Marshalltown.
      (2)   If the preliminary plat submitted by the subdivider is rejected by
the city for any reason, the subdivider may resubmit a revised application
within one year, satisfying the reason for rejection, without paying an
additional fee.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the preliminary
plat is in proper form. The Council and Commission shall not receive nor
consider the application as filed until all documents are in accordance with
the requirements set forth herein. The Zoning Administrator shall inform the
Commission and Council, in writing, that the fee has been paid and all other
requirements have been met.

subdivision lies outside the City Limits the Zoning Administrator shall submit
one copy of the preliminary plat to the County Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   Any interested person may address the Commission orally or in
writing regarding any preliminary plat but notice of the Commission's
consideration of same need not be given. The Commission shall review the
preliminary plat considering the oral or written comments from interested
parties and take appropriate action. If recommended for approval, the
Commission shall, by written report, express its action as a conditional
approval and shall recommend the conditions of such approval, if any; or if
recommended for disapproval, shall express its reasons therefore.
      (6)   The action of the Commission shall be noted on three copies of the
preliminary plat. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, and two copies
forwarded to the Council.
      (7)   The Council shall consider the recommendation of the Commission and
shall take action on the application within 60 days of its filing with the
Zoning Administrator. If the Commission has not recommended approval, the
Council may approve said plat only by a 3/4 vote of the entire Council. The
action of the Council shall be recorded on the copies forwarded by the
Commission and one copy each shall be kept as permanent records by the City
Clerk and by the City Engineer.
      (8)   Approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a maximum
period of 12 months except that submission within this period of a final plat
applying to at least a portion of the area covered by the preliminary plat
shall extend the effective period of approval to a maximum of 60 months from
date of approval.
      (9)   Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the
final plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval of the layout
submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final
plat.
      (10)   A final plat may be submitted no sooner than 14 days after the
preliminary plat has been approved. Final plats may only be submitted

split and:

lot; and

preliminary plat which he proposes to record and develop at one time, provided
that such portion shall conform to all requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall refer one copy of the final plat to
the Mayor, one copy each to the Commission members, one copy to the City
Planner, two copies to the City Engineer, and one copy to the City Solicitor
for their review and report.
      (4)   The Commission, City Solicitor, the City Planner, and the City
Engineer shall check the final plat to see that it is in substantial agreement
with the preliminary plat as approved and that it meets all ordinances and
regulations of the city. If the Commission recommends approval, such approval
shall be entered upon the reproducible originals by the Chairman. If the
Commission disapproves, it shall transmit its reasons to the Council and
provide the applicant a copy. The Commission shall act on the final plat within
30 days of filing.
      (5)   Within 60 days of filing, the Council shall take action. If the
Council approves, such approval shall be duly entered by the Mayor and City
Clerk. Approval by the Council shall be by resolution setting forth all
conditions upon which approval is predicated. If the Council disapproves, it
shall set forth its reasons and provide the applicant and Commission with a
copy.
      (6)   The final plat shall not be recorded until the performance
guarantee for public improvements is accepted by the Council. A certificate to
that effect shall be issued by the City Clerk on demand and shall accompany the
final plat.
   (D)   Filing.

§ 157.005 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR PLATS.
   The following regulations control the manner in which streets, lots and
other elements of the subdivision are arranged on the land.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The subdivision shall conform to the Marshalltown Comprehensive
Plan (General Development Plan).
      (2)   The subdivision shall be designed to serve potential building sites
in the most advantageous manner.
      (3)   Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, erosion, or of slope
deemed unsuitable for residential use, shall not be platted for residential
occupancy nor shall such land be platted for other use as may continue such
conditions, or increase danger to health, safety, life or property.
   (B)   Streets and alleys.
      (1)   The design of all streets shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic, to
topographical conditions, to runoff of storm waters and to the proposed uses of
the area to be served.
      (2)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of
streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper projection of
streets. When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible to being
subdivided, then the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of the
lands being subdivided.
      (3)   The following table of standards for street design shall be
observed by the subdividers:
 
              Minimum right-
Street and    of-way width   Minimum roadway Maximum gradient Minimum gradient

* 68 ft. where parking is allowed
** Steeper grades to a maximum of 10% may be allowed upon recommendations of
the City Engineer
*** Actual width shall be established by the City Council at its discretion.
      (4)   Tangents of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between
reverse curves on collector streets and 50 feet on lesser streets.
      (5)   Where new streets extend existing adjoining streets, their
projections shall be at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the
minimum required width.
      (6)   Local streets shall be so designed that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
      (7)   Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 130 feet shall be
avoided.
      (8)   Insofar as practical, street intersections shall be at right
angles.
      (9)   No dead-end streets shall be approved unless said streets are
provided to connect with future streets on adjacent land. In such event, a
temporary turn-around shall be provided.
      (10)   Each cul-de-sac shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-
around having a minimum outside roadway diameter of 90 feet and a minimum
street property line diameter of 120 feet.
      (11)   Half-streets shall be prohibited except where the city finds a
better design will result and when the city deems it practical to require the
dedication of the other half of an arterial, local or collector street when the
adjoining property is subdivided.
      (12)   Where a proposed plat is adjacent to an arterial, the city may
require the developer to provide marginal access/frontage streets along the
right-of-way of such facilities or they may require that lots should back on
the thoroughfare, in which case, vehicular and pedestrian access between the
lots and thoroughfare shall be prohibited.
      (13)   The street arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to
owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing
convenient access to it.
      (14)   Curb lines at street intersections shall be rounded to a minimum
of 25 feet.
      (15)   The provision for alleys shall be discouraged.
      (16)   A building set-back line safeguarding future street widening or
other improvement may be required by the city.
      (17)   Additional right-of-way may be required by the city along existing
collector and arterial streets to meet the requirements of §
157.005(B)(3).
   (C)   Public easements.
      (1)   Easements shall be provided for utilities, where necessary. They
shall be centered on rear and side lot lines or along the front lot line as
required by the utility companies. They shall have continuity of alignment from
block to block. At deflection points, easements for pole line anchors shall be
provided where necessary.
      (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way substantially in alignment with the lines of such watercourse,
together with such further width for construction or both, as will be adequate
for storm water runoff. The easement shall include not only the stream channel,
but also adjoining areas that have been subject to flooding in years of heavy
runoff.
      (3)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, the City Council may require an easement over and across
certain portions of the subdivision lying contiguous to said waterway, the
width of which the Council shall determine, for green belt public recreation
and public access areas, provided, however, that said purposes shall not
include use by any motorized means of transportation, except for maintenance
vehicles.
      (4)   Easement widths shall be determined by the City Council as
recommended by the City Engineer, except no easement for utility or drainage
purposes shall be less than 12 feet in width on rear lot lines and ten feet in
width on side lot lines and the same shall be apportioned between abutting and
subject property.
   (D)   Blocks.
      (1)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks and lots shall provide for
adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the use contemplated;
provide for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of traffic, and
provide for the limitations and opportunities of topography.
      (2)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,320 feet and, if possible, shall
not be less than 400 feet in length. In blocks longer than 800 feet, a
pedestrian crossway with a minimum right-of-way of ten feet shall be required
near the center of the block. The use of additional walkways and access ways to
schools, parks, scenic points and other destinations may also be required by
the City Council.
      (3)   A block shall be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, except where a change of land use, severe topographic
conditions or a highway necessitates a single tier of lots in the opinion of
the Planning Commission. In these cases the lot depth shall be at least 25 feet
greater than minimum requirements.
   (E)   Lots.
      (1)   Every lot shall front on a publicly dedicated street except in
planned unit developments according to the City Zoning Ordinance and as
approved by the City Council. A lot located in the General Commercial or
General Industrial Zone may have private access from an adjacent lot or from a
private street if all the following conditions are met:
         (a)   Any private access or private street must be compliant with Fire
Code;
         (b)   An easement which permits access from the adjacent lot or
private street must be properly recorded with the property title of each
affected lot;
         (c)   Property titles of all lots must indicate that the city will not
maintain or have dedication of the private street, private access or easement;
         (d)   Any storm water retention pond and/or stand-alone access parcel
must be combined with an adjacent developed parcel by execution and recording
of an affidavit of non-severability; and
         (e)   All other requirements in this Code not directly related to the
private access or private street still apply.
      (2)   Where possible, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines. Lots with frontage on two
approximately parallel streets shall be permitted only under unusual
circumstances.
      (3)   Minimum lot sizes within the City shall conform to zoning
regulations in force. Corner lots shall be platted at least ten feet wider than
the minimum lot width required in the zoning ordinance.
      (4)   Residential lots, served by septic systems, shall be a minimum of
90 feet wide at the building line and shall have a minimum area and depth as
recommended by the City Engineer, provided further that no such lot shall have
an area less than 33,000 square feet.
      (5)   Residential lots on major street intersections and at other
intersections having restricted vision clearance due to topographic or other
conditions may be required to have a corner radius or other special shape.
   (F)   Public lands.
      (1)   Because subdivision activity creates a need for land space devoted
to public use in addition to that ordinarily set aside for streets and
easements, the city, or the Marshalltown Community School District, or both
acting together, may reserve a part or all of a proposed subdivision for public
use such as, but not limited to, parks, schools, or playgrounds. The city, or
the Marshalltown Community School District, or both acting together, shall
purchase any such reserved land within two years after approval of a final plat
adjoining such reserved land. This section shall not apply to easements set
forth in §
157.005(C).
      (2)   If the reserved area is to be served by any of the streets, sewers,
street lights, or other improvements of any subdivision adjacent to it, the
proportionate cost shall be born by the city, or the Marshalltown Community
School District, or both acting together.
   (G)   Natural features. In the subdivision of land, due regard shall be
shown for all natural features and historic sites which, if preserved, will add
attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
   
   (H)   Restrictive covenants. The subdivider is encouraged to further
restrict the use of land within the subdivision to achieve better development.
However, any covenants which do not assist orderly, efficient, integrated
development and promote the general welfare of the community in the opinion of
the Commission may constitute grounds for disapproval of the plat.
(Ord. 15090, passed 8-26-2024)
§ 157.006 REQUIRED MINIMUM SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   Before the city approves a Final Plat, the subdivider shall give
satisfactory assurance of the provision of the following improvements:
   (A)   Monuments.
      (1)   Monumentation shall be provided according to I.C.A. § 355.6.
      (2)   A permanent benchmark meeting USGS standards with a brass plate
inscribing the number and elevation shall be accessibly placed within
subdivisions exceeding one acre when directed by the City Engineer, the
elevation of which shall be referred to the USGS datum and accurately noted on
the subdivision plat.
      (3)   All official benchmarks, monuments or triangulation stations shall
be preserved in precise location.
   (B)   Grading and surface drainage.
      (1)   Grading and the provision of surface drainage facilities shall
minimize damage to the natural features of the subdivision and avoid erosion
onto adjoining properties.
      (2)   Grading shall be accomplished in such a manner as to prevent
ponding in excess of eight inches in the event of a complete failure of the
storm sewer system.
      (3)   Drainage easements shall be provided in all cases when surface
waters from more than two lots are conveyed down a property line.
      (4)   All street and alley rights-of-way shall be graded to full width
and to the line and in a manner approved by the City Engineer. The grade of all
streets, alleys and sidewalks shall be established by ordinance.
      (5)   Within Flood Plain Overlay Districts indicated on the Zoning Map of
Marshalltown principal building sites are to be filled and graded so that the
first floor and basement floor will be at a point no lower than one foot above
the flood protection elevation for the principal building site and shall be
designed to extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the
anticipated structure. However, no filling or excavation shall be permitted
which will adversely affect the capacity of floodways and tributary channels,
drainage ditches or other drainage facility. The City Engineer shall approve
only those improvements which provide adequate protection from floods.
   (C)   Storm water sewerage and erosion control.
      (1)   The subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system adequate to
serve the area, including anticipated extension of use to serve additional
areas. The storm sewer system shall be constructed in accordance with design
standards of the city and at sewer grades approved by the city. The design
shall be based upon rain storms of ten year frequency and to carry the runoff
anticipated from the development of tributary areas at the density indicated on
the Comprehensive Guide Plan.
      (2)   The subdivider shall provide at his own cost all storm sewers below
25" in size, and shall pay an amount equal to the cost of the 24" size for all
sewers required above the 24" size.
      (3)   The subdivider shall provide an erosion control plan to prevent
siltation onto adjacent property, the public street, or into storm water
intakes.
      (4)   The subdivider shall provide and maintain, temporary seeding, silt
fences, and erosion control matting to prevent erosion until permanent seeding
is growing.
      (5)   The subdivider shall provide at their sole cost a subdrain tile
line system to provide access from each lot to the storm sewer system. In areas
that have storm sewer, tile laterals shall be extended to each lot. In areas
that don't have storm sewers, tile line extensions shall be provided behind
each curb extending from an existing storm sewer or ditch outlet to each
property frontage.
   (D)   Sanitary sewerage.
      (1)   The subdivider shall make adequate provision for the disposal of
sanitary sewage from the platted area. He shall at his expense construct a
sanitary sewer system including all necessary pumping stations, pumping
equipment, manholes and laterals to the street right-of-way lines to provide
for the discharge of sanitary sewage from all lots or parcels of land, within
the platted area to a connection with the city's sanitary sewers. The sewerage
system shall be constructed in accordance with the design standards of the city
and at the sewer grades as approved by the city.
      (2)   The subdivider shall provide at his own cost all sanitary sewers
below eleven inches in size and shall pay an amount equal to the cost of ten
inch size for all sanitary sewer required above the ten inch size.
      (3)   The Plan and Zoning Commission may waive the requirements of this
division (D). When gravity sanitary sewers are not feasible, provided septic
systems meet the specifications of the City Engineer as to soil type and
density, minimum lot size, drainage area, area density, and such other
specifications he may impose. In addition, the subdivider shall install a dry
sewer that will meet all requirements of §
157.006(D)(1) above.
   (E)   Water supply system. Lots shall be served by the Marshalltown public
water supply system in accordance with plans and specifications of the city.
   (F)   Street paving, curbs, gutters and sidewalks.
      (1)   The subdivider shall pave all streets with full depth asphalt or
concrete paving. The subgrade and street improvement shall be constructed in
accordance with the design standards of the city, and shall adequately reflect
the classification of the street, its location and anticipated volume of
traffic. The installation of the streets shall be under the supervision of the
City Engineer and the subdivider shall be required to pay a reasonable charge
for the engineering and inspection service.
      (2)   Curbs and gutters shall be required for all lots and on all
arterial and collector streets, except if part of a Planned Unit Development.
Curb and gutter shall also be required on the side adjacent to the proposed
subdivision when the subdivision abuts an existing platted street with a rural
type street cross section unless the topography or other circumstances wouldn't
justify such installation. In those circumstances, the developer shall provide
the city a payment in the amount equal to those improvements required but not
constructed to be placed in an escrow account for the city to use in the future
when those improvements are constructed.
      (3)   Sidewalks shall be provided by the subdivider in all residential
subdivisions and in all commercial and industrial development areas and in all
blocks adjacent to a block containing a school or planned to contain a school.
Additional walks shall be provided as required by the City Council.
         (a)   Commercial and industrial zoned lots and subdivisions shall have
a sidewalk system which provides pedestrians a safe access to all buildings
from the public street entrances.
         (b)   For all zoning districts, grading for sidewalk improvements is
required at the time of final plat, if sidewalks are not installed at the time
of final plat.
         (c)   Sidewalk must be installed before occupancy of the property is
permitted.
         (d)   Remaining sidewalks must be installed within a period of two
years on all undeveloped lots in a subdivision once 70% of the lots in the
subdivision have sidewalks.
         (e)   All sidewalks in a subdivision must be installed within ten
years of the date the final plat was approved.
         (f)   If an undeveloped lot is sold to an owner of an adjacent
developed lot for the purpose of free space, parking, or an undetermined future
need, then the undeveloped lot must have sidewalks installed at the time of
sale.
      (4)   Disabled access to sidewalks by curb ramping. Provisions shall be
made for curb ramping to sidewalks on all corners at each street intersection
and other locations as required by the City Council.
   (G)   Street lights and street name signs. Street lights shall be provided
by the subdivider equal to or exceeding the minimum design standards of the
city and the plans of the Commission, if any. Street name signs will be
provided by the city.
   (H)   Street terraces. The street terraces shall be graded and seeded
according to city specifications.
   (I)   Public telephone, electric utility (15kv and below), cable TV, and
other wire service utilities.
Underground service shall be required except by variance by the Council. The
subdivider shall be responsible for making necessary arrangements for the
installation of such facilities, shall assure that they do not interfere with
other underground utilities and that incidental appurtenances, such as
transformer enclosure, and the like shall be located so as not to be unsightly
or hazardous to the public.
   (J)   Major utility transmission lines. All major utility transmission lines
designed to provide utility distribution through a new subdivision shall be
placed underground or located so as to provide the least possible effect upon
the subdivision.
(Ord. 14688, passed 2-11-2002)
§ 157.007 PROCEDURES FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Improvements paid for by subdivider. Before the submission of the
final plat the subdivider shall guarantee the construction of all improvements
in accordance with approved plans and specifications and insure completion of
the improvements within an approved specified time. All sewers, water lines,
drainage facilities, street improvements, sidewalks, street lights and other
designated improvements shall, upon inspection, approval and acceptance by the
city, become the property of the city.
   (B)   Detailed engineering plans.
      (1)   All engineering plans shall be submitted on 11 inch by 17 inch
sheets or multiples thereof and shall bear the signature and seal of the
Professional Engineer (and architect, if any) under whose directions they were
prepared. Two prints of preliminary plans and two reproducible sets of final
plans shall be submitted to the City Engineer.
      (2)   The City Engineer shall review the improvement plans for
conformance with design standards and other requirements of the city. Other
City Development Staff may review the plans for conformance with standards of
design with particular attention to location and aesthetic qualities.
   (C)   Construction and inspection.
      (1)   The City Engineer shall inspect the construction of infrastructure
improvements installed by a developer or subdivider (hereinafter "developer").
A construction inspection service fee shall be charged pursuant to the current
City of Marshalltown construction administration, inspection and staking
services contract.
      (2)   The developer's engineer shall submit two complete full size sets
of plans and number of calendar days the developer's contractor will be given
to complete the project and make it ready for final inspection by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer shall use the plans and specified contract calendar
days in preparing a not to exceed fee amount of the cost to provide
construction administration, inspection and staking services. Payment of this
fee shall be a condition precedent to the approval of the project plans by the
City Engineer. Although the developer's engineer shall have the authority to
determine the number of calendar days needed to complete the project, the City
Engineer shall have the authority to withhold approval of the project plans if
the City Engineer determines that the submitted days for the completion of the
project is unreasonable.
      (3)   If, during the construction of the project, it appears that the
project will not be completed by the developer in the number of calendar days
specified by the developer's engineer and additional construction inspection
services are required, the developer's engineer shall submit a statement of the
City Engineer that indicates the number of additional calendar days needed to
complete the project. Before additional construction inspection services are
provided on the project for any additional calendar days beyond the original
completion date, the developer shall pay a per day fee for the additional costs
to provide construction administration, inspection, and staking services for
the additional number of calendar days submitted by the developer's engineer.
This per day fee shall be determined by dividing the original fee amount by the
number of specified calendar days the contractor was originally allotted to
complete the project. This developer notification and advance inspection fee
payment process shall continue until the project is completed. No project shall
be finally accepted by the city until all construction administration,
inspection, and staking service fees have been paid in full by the developer.
If the additional per day fee paid pursuant to this division by the developer
is higher than the actual final cost incurred by the city for additional
construction inspection services, the difference between the total additional
per day fee and the city's actual final cost shall be rebated by the city to
the developer.
      (4)   The City Council may by resolution accept improvements after
receipt of a written notice of a satisfactory final inspection by the City
Engineer and the posting of a maintenance guarantee.
   (D)   Guarantee of performance and maintenance.
      (1)   The subdivider shall guarantee the completion of all required
improvements within a period of two years after the approval of the final plat
by a construction performance bond, subdivision bond or certified check. Said
guarantee shall be in the amount of 100% of the estimated construction costs of
such uncompleted improvements as determined by the City Engineer.
      (2)   The subdivider shall provide a maintenance bond in the amount of
100% of the construction cost of all sewers and street improvements. The
maintenance period for all street and sewer improvements shall be four years
except the maintenance period for all sidewalk improvements is hereby changed
from four years to two years from the date of city acceptance of the completed
improvements. Said guarantees shall be in the amount of 100% for the first
year, 75% the second year, 50% the third year, and 25% the fourth year.
      (3)   If the required improvements are not completed within the required
time or if improvements are not satisfactorily maintained for the required
time, the subdivider shall be automatically in default and the guarantee of
performance shall be applied by the city to the costs of completing or
restoring said improvements.
(Ord. 14776, passed 11-14-2005; Ord. 14844, passed 09-09-2008)
§ 157.008 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Enforcing officer and appeals. The Director of Public Works upon
recommendations of the Planning Commission and in conformity to the provisions
of this chapter is hereby designated as the enforcing officer for the
administration of this chapter. Any party having an interest in any matter
dealt with by the provisions of this chapter and aggrieved by a decision of the
Zoning Administrator, the Planning Commission, the Director of Public Works, or
officer delegated to issue permits of any kind hereunder, may file a written
appeal within 45 days thereafter to the City Council. The City Council after
giving a ten day published notice shall conduct a public hearing on such appeal
and shall receive and consider the proofs offered for or against the decision
appealed from and determine the same by majority vote of the whole number of
Council members. The person aggrieved, if the Council vote is unfavorable, may
within 30 days further appeal to the District Court under certiorari for review
of the Council's action.
   (B)   Building and occupancy permits. No building permit shall be issued by
any governing official for the construction of any building, structure or
improvement on any land henceforth subdivided until all requirements of this
chapter have been fully complied with. No certificate of occupancy shall be
granted for the use of any structure within any subdivision approved for
platting until required utilities and roadways have been installed and made
ready for service to the property.
   (C)   Variances and exceptions. When the subdivider can show to the Planning
Commission that a provision of these regulations, or provisions, if strictly
enforced, would cause unnecessary hardship because of topographic or other non-
created or non-self-inflicted conditions peculiar to the site being developed,
and a variance or exception can be permitted without destroying the intent of
this chapter, nor interfere with carrying out the Comprehensive Plan, the
Planning Commission may make such variance or modification of the development
plan so that such hardship may be relieved and the public interest served, but
such waiver or modification shall not authorize or release the requirements for
the public improvements as are required under this Platting Ordinance.
   (D)   Planned unit development under zoning ordinance.
      (1)   The provisions of this chapter establish requirements concerning
the platting of lots for sale and the construction of public improvements to
service the lots in order to improve the development of the city. To encourage
even better development a Planned Unit Development procedure is established
which will provide more flexibility in the application of these provisions.
      (2)   Provisions for Planned Unit Development shall be as described in
the City of Marshalltown, Iowa, Zoning Ordinance. Under certain procedures and
conditions specified therein these Land Subdivision Regulations may be modified
for a specific development only. Modifications may include, but are not limited
to: lots of smaller size, private utilities, more than one principal structure
on each lot and lots which do not abut a dedicated public street. In essence,
the approved drawings and accompanying materials become the zoning provisions
