resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new

publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain multiple

vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police

1.   Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer shall
be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands at
the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or
driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may be
extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
3.   Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to the
public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code and
applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight line

business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06   INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Grease, oil, sludge, and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and service
stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper

owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at all
times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from

Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City based on said user’s
use of the treatment works as determined by water meters acceptable to the
City, as follows:
1.   Normal Domestic Users. For residential contributors and other “normal
domestic users” monthly user charges shall be based on water used during the
current month.
2.   Industrial and Commercial Use. For industrial and commercial contributors,
user charges shall be based on water used during the current month. If a
commercial or industrial contributor has a consumptive use of water, or in some
other manner uses water which is not returned to the wastewater collection
system, the user charge for that contributor may be based on a wastewater meter
installed and maintained at the contributor’s expense, and in a manner
acceptable to the City.

will be collected. The minimum charge/meter charge of $50.00 will be collected.
The surcharge for operation and maintenance including replacement and debt
retirement is $.1474 per pound BOD and $.2311 per pound SS/suspended solids and
$1.80 per 1,000 gallons of flow. In the event that an extra-strength
contributor, whose waste discharge is regulated by a treatment agreement
between that contributor and the City, discharge effluent in excess of the
parameters established in the agreement, the fine/penalty will be set out in
the treatment agreement between the City and the contributor.
99.09   RESPONSIBILITY FOR INCREASED COSTS.
Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the City’s treatment works or
any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with
other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of operation,
maintenance, or replacement of the treatment works shall pay for such increased
costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the responsible
plant operating personnel and approved by the Council.
99.10   APPLICATION.
The user charge rates established in this chapter apply to all users of the
City’s treatment works, regardless of their location.

Except as provided for in Section
92.07 of this Code of Ordinances, the owner of the premises served and any
lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for sewer
service charges to the premises. Sewer service charges remaining unpaid and
delinquent shall constitute a lien upon the premises served and shall be
certified to the County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property
taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84[1])
99.13   REVIEW OF USER CHARGE SYSTEM.
The City shall review the user charge system at least every two years and
revise user charge rates as necessary to ensure that the system generates
adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation and maintenance including
replacement, and debt service, if any, and that the system continues to provide
for the proportional distribution of operation and maintenance including
replacement costs and debt service among users and user classes.
99.14   NOTIFICATION OF RATE CHANGE.
The City will notify each user initially and when there is a change in the
amount of rates being charged for operation, maintenance, including replacement

101.01   PURPOSE AND ESTABLISHMENT OF STORM WATER DRAINAGE UTILITY.
1.   Pursuant to 384.84 Code of Iowa, the City Council finds, determines and
declares it to be conducive to the health, welfare, safety and convenience of
the City and its residents that a storm water drainage utility, to be known as
the Sanborn Storm Water Drainage Utility, is established, and it is ordained
and declared that the property located within the City limits of the City of
Sanborn shall be and constitute the storm water drainage utility, and that the
utility shall compromise and include elements of the City’s storm water
drainage and flood protection systems which provide for the collection,
treatment and disposal of storm water, surface water, and groundwater.
It is further found, determined, and declared that the elements of the storm
water drainage utility are of benefit and provide services to all real
properties within the incorporated City limits, including property not directly
served by the storm water drainage system, and that such benefits and services
may include but are not limited to the provision of adequate systems of
collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of storm water; the
reduction of hazard to property and life resulting from storm water runoff and
flooding; improvement in general health and welfare through reduction of
undesirable storm water conditions and flooding; and improvement to the water
quality in the storm water and surface water system and its receiving waters.
2.   It is further determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the
protection of the public health, welfare, safety and convenience of the City
and its residents that charges be levied upon and collected from the owners or
occupants of all lots, parcels of real estate, and buildings that discharge
storm water or surface or subsurface waters, directly or indirectly, to the
City storm water drainage system, and that the proceeds of such charges so
derived be used for the purposes of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement
and debt service for construction of the storm water drainage and flood
protection improvements comprising the storm water drainage system.
3.   The City Council finds, determines, and declares it the purpose of this
ordinance is to establish the Storm Water Drainage Utility, authorize charges,
rates and fees for use of, and discharge to, the storm and surface water
drainage system.
4.   The City Council finds that the construction, operation and maintenance of
the City’s storm water drainage system should be funded through user charges
imposed for the discharge of storm and surface water to the storm water
drainage system, thereby charging those persons and activities using or
receiving service from that system.
5.   The City may be required to provide increased quantity or quality controls
to mitigate those impacts of pollutants from discharging storm and surface
waters into the storm water system. Therefore, it is appropriate to impose a
storm and surface water user charge upon all users of property which may
discharge, directly or indirectly, into the storm water system.

112.01   PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The City Council finds it necessary for the City to establish uniform rules and
controls to ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by
the City and others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for
the delivery of utility services. This is necessary in order to protect public
and private investment, ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the
health, safety, and welfare of the population; to provide for the regulation
and administration of public streets and other public property; and to secure
the rights of the City to a return on its investment in public property. This
chapter is to be interpreted in light of these findings for the benefit of the
public and users of the streets and other public property.
112.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined:
1.   “Operator” means the person or entity who owns a relevant utility service.
2.   “Utility Service” means the distribution, transmission or sale of
television, electricity, internet, video, audio, telephone, telecommunications,
and/or gas services via any material or non-material medium, where some portion
of City right-of-way or other public property is physically involved at some
point in the delivery process.
112.03   LICENSE REQUIRED.
No operator shall use the public right-of-way or other public property for
utility service without first obtaining a license from the City. Licenses shall
be issued per utility service. That is, a separate license is required for each
utility service even though the same medium or public property is used to
transmit more than one service. Each license issued shall designate the service
to which it relates. An application for a license shall be filed with the City
Manager on a form provided by the City and shall include at a minimum the
following information: the name, address, and telephone number of a person whom
the City may notify or contact at any time concerning the license; an
acceptable site plan showing the proposed location of the utilities including
any manholes, the size, type, and proposed depth of any conduit or other
enclosures; the type of utility service to which the license pertains; and any
additional information the City may require. All licenses required by this
section shall be approved by the City Council.
112.04   COMPENSATION REQUIRED.
All licensees shall pay reasonable and competitively neutral compensation for
the non-exclusive use of public right-of-way or other public property.
Therefore, a one-time license charge will be assessed on all licenses for the
term of the license. Payment is due when the license is issued; however, a
payment schedule may be agreed upon between the City and the licensee. If the
license is renewed, a new license charge shall be assessed and paid. The fee is
based on administrative and development costs for issuing licenses, and costs
for the use and maintenance of public grounds, and is established at $500.00.
112.05   LIMIT ON TERM.
No license or lease for use of the public right-of-way or other public property
shall be granted for a term exceeding five years.
112.06   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
The facilities, fixtures, and equipment for the distribution, transmission or
sale of any utility service shall be placed and maintained so as not to
unnecessarily or unreasonably interfere with travel on the streets, highways,
avenues, alleys, bridges, and public places in the City, nor shall such
facilities, fixtures, and equipment interfere with the proper use of the same,
including, but not limited to, ordinary drainage, or the functioning of sewers,
underground pipe, or other property of the City. In the event that facilities,
fixtures, and equipment of any person or other entity located within a public
right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road construction or road
reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction, or the construction
or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public works, or the
construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any City owned utility,
such relocation, at the written request of the City, shall be completed by the
owner of such facilities at the owner’s cost. The City shall upon request of
any person or other entity holding a license review any plans for the
construction of facilities, fixtures, and equipment within the public right-of-
way and advise the person or other entity of any conflict such construction may
have with planned or anticipated public improvements, but failure of the City
to so advise such person or other entity will not relieve the operator of its
obligations under this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager
or designee may require that placement of equipment or utilities belonging to
any operator be limited to locations designated by the City Manager, if such
limitation is deemed to be necessary to protect the integrity of use of present
and future users of the public rights-of-way or other public property. In
addition, all excavation or areas disturbed shall be brought back to original
condition or better as determined by the City representative.
112.07   INDEMNIFICATION.
The operator shall indemnify, defend, and hold the City harmless at all times
during the term of the license from and against all claims for injury or damage
to any person or property, including payments under workers’ compensation laws,
caused by the construction, erection, operation, or maintenance of facilities,
fixtures, or equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its employees.
In case of any suit or action at law being commenced against the City, upon any
claim arising out of any loss, injury, or damage claimed to have been caused by
any installation, improvement, obstruction, or excavation made or left in,
under, or upon such street, sidewalk, alley, or public place by the operator,
or by its agents, contractors, or employees, then the holder, upon being
notified in writing by the City of such action or proceeding, shall undertake
its defense at its cost. If any judgment or decree shall in any such case be
rendered against the City, the operator shall assume, pay, and satisfy such
judgment or decree, with the cost thereof. Immediately upon issuance of the
license, the operator shall purchase general liability insurance. The amount of
insurance shall be a minimum of $500,000.00 with a maximum deductible of
$5,000.00 and provide the City with a 30-day notice of cancellation of this
policy. The operator shall file with the City Manager a certificate of
insurance which clearly discloses on its face coverage in conformity with these
requirements. Upon request of the City, the holder of the license shall submit
a certified copy of the policy.
112.08   REGULATION BY THE CITY.
The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the use
of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically
provided shall apply to any operator.
112.09   CONSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION BY HOLDERS OF A LICENSE.
In making excavations in the streets, right-of-way, or public grounds, the
operator shall properly protect according to safety standards generally
accepted at the time of placement, as may be determined from time to time by
the City representative, all excavations and obstructions by proper placement
of shoring, surface plates, barricades, warning lights, and such other or
additional devices as circumstances may warrant. If in the opinion of the City
representative such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely
protected, the City representative shall notify such operator who shall
immediately comply with such reasonable instructions. Immediately after use,
any trenches for excavations which the operator has opened shall be filled.
However, no trench or excavation in the streets, right-of-way, or public
grounds shall be filled or covered without giving the City the right and
opportunity to inspect it. If excavation is in a grassed area, sod replacement
will be required unless seeding is acceptable as determined by the City
representative. All backfilling in streets/sidewalks will be according to City
specifications of at least 95 percent compaction. Temporary street surfacing
will be placed in such excavations as soon as the same has been backfilled.
Pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, or other portions of streets and
right-of-ways or public places opened, disturbed, or damaged shall be promptly
restored by saw cutting the edges of the existing surfaces and replaced with
like materials at the expense of the operator and left in as good condition or
better than before the opening, disturbance, or damage occurred. In the event
like replacement materials are not available, the operator shall notify the
City representative who must approve the use of any alternate materials. In the
event that the operator fails to comply with the provisions of this section,
after having been given reasonable notice, the City may do such works as may be
needed to properly repair such pavements, sidewalk, curbs and gutters, or other
portions of streets and public places and the cost thereof shall be repaid to
the City by the operator. In cases where a cut or disturbance is made in a
section of street paving or sidewalk but causes greater disturbance than to
just the area cut, then, rather than replace only the area cut, the operator
shall replace that area within 30 days, which in no event shall exceed the
panel or panels disturbed.
112.10   CITY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING.
Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or sidewalk or shall change
the grade line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct
any conduit, water main service or water connection, sanitary sewer, storm
sewer, or other City-owned public works or City-owned utility, it shall be the
duty of the operator when so ordered by the City, to relocate its service lines
and other property in the streets or other public places at its own expense so
as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or public place
and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so constructed or
reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements, including but not
limited to urban renewal projects, the City may require the operator to
relocate its service lines and appurtenances in the streets at the operator's
expense. The City may at its discretion assign personnel for inspection of
excavation and related work being performed by the operator. Should the
operator fail or refuse to perform the requirements of this section, the City
may, after reasonable notice, perform the work and charge the expense thereof
to the operator and the operator shall promptly pay said charges.
112.11   DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY.
The operator shall promptly, upon request, furnish the City representative a
detailed map or maps including but not limited to dimensions of its
distribution system and facilities both within the City limits and the area
within two miles surrounding the City, unless that area is within another city.
The operator shall thereafter update the map or maps at least annually or upon
request, showing all subsequent additions or deletions to the distribution
system. Prior to any excavation by the City or its agents, a representative
must contact the operator regarding current information on the location of
underground lines or facilities in the area concerned. The obligation to
contact the operator under this section shall be satisfied if contact is made
with a corporation organized pursuant to Code of Iowa Chapter 480 or an entity
with a similar function utilized by both the City and the company, currently
the Iowa One-Call System.
112.12   ASSIGNMENT.
No sale or assignment of any license shall be effective until it is approved by
the City Council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office of the
City Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition, or
assignment. Such notice shall clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the City shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee, or lessee shall similarly
file a duly executed document, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms of
the license, and agreeing to perform all of the conditions thereof.
112.13   FORFEITURE.
The violation of any material portion of a license by the operator or its
successors or assigns, or its failure promptly to perform any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of the license and the
termination of all rights thereunder. Such forfeiture shall be accomplished by
ordinance of the City after written notice to the operator and a continuation
of the violation, failure, or default specified on the notice for at least 30
days from the date the notice was served.
112.14   APPLICATION.
This chapter shall apply to all operators who currently have a utility service
or in the future establish a utility service.
112.15   HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end any limitations on
the power of the City contained herein is to be liberally construed and the
City reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to
regulate and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of
the City shall be enforceable against any operator.

chapter abut each other, the fencing requirement of this chapter shall be
waived by the Zoning Officer for such common boundary so long as the common
boundary continues to exist.
3.   If the junkyard that is the subject of the application abuts against an

is not less than six feet high, the fencing requirement of this section shall
be waived by the Zoning Officer for such common boundary.

All driveway improvements in public property, whether performed by the owner of
abutting property or by the City, shall be performed under the supervision and
inspection of the City Engineer and in accordance with the plans and

location and grade established by the City Engineer.
141.03   PERMIT TO CONSTRUCT DRIVEWAY.
No person shall make any driveway improvements whether ordered by the Council
or not, unless such person shall obtain a permit from the City Engineer and

the City Engineer and subject to the approval of the City Engineer or the City
Engineer’s duly authorized agent. The owner shall file a bond in the proper
amount and shall also agree to hold the City free from all liability for

145.02   GENERAL DEFINITION OF UNSAFE.
All buildings or structures that are structurally unsafe or not provided with
adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous
to human life, or that in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to
safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment, are, for the purpose of this
chapter, unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be
public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, or
removal in accordance with the procedure specified in this chapter.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 657A.1 and 364.12[3a])
145.03   UNSAFE BUILDING.
“Unsafe building” means any structure or mobile home meeting any or all of the
following criteria:

thereof, because of: (i) dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; (ii) faulty
construction; (iii) the removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the
ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; (iv) the
deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or (v) any other cause,
is likely to partially or completely collapse.
2.   Manifestly Unsafe. Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or
any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being
used.
3.   Inadequate Maintenance. Whenever a building or structure, used or intended
to be used for dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay, damage,
faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined by any health officer to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such condition that it is likely
to cause sickness or disease.
4.   Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is determined by the Fire
Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.
5.   Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.
145.04   NOTICE TO OWNER.
The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within 48 hours or such reasonable time as
the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or
improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions
thereof, and all such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of
notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the enforcement officer. If necessary,
such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to
be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the enforcement officer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
1.   Notice Served. Such notice shall be served by sending by certified mail to
the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h] of the Code of Iowa, if
the owner is found within the City limits. If the owner is not found within the
City limits, such service may be made upon the owner by registered mail or
certified mail. The designated period within which said owner or person in
charge is required to comply with the order of the enforcement officer shall
begin as of the date the owner receives such notice.
2.   Hearing. Such notice shall also advise the owner that he or she may
request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a written request
for hearing within the time provided in the notice.
145.05   CONDUCT OF HEARING.
If requested, the Council shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the
following:
1.   Notice. The owner shall be served with written notice specifying the date,
time and place of hearing.
2.   Owner’s Rights. At the hearing, the owner may appear and show cause why

permission of the enforcement officer and no person shall enter the building
except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
building.
145.07   RIGHT TO DEMOLISH; MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or
portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building prosecuted as
a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the enforcement
officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice. A statement of the
cost of such work shall be transmitted to the Council. As an alternative to
this action, the City may utilize the municipal infraction process to abate the
nuisance.

1   Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2   The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3   Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4   Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

165.13   ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
The Commission, as soon as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter,
shall pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified. If
the Commission does not act within 30 days, the preliminary plat shall be
deemed to be approved; provided, however, the subdivider may agree to an
extension of the time period, not to exceed an additional 60 days. It shall
then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval,
modification, or disapproval.
1.   Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial changes
or modifications are made by the Commission or the Commission recommends
disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it may request
and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the same manner as
the original plat.
2.   Tentative Approval. If the Commission recommends approval, it shall
express its approval as “Tentative Approval” and state the conditions of such

Within 30 days of its receipt of the preliminary plat, the Council shall, by
resolution, tentatively approve or disapprove the plat. If the preliminary plat
is disapproved, objections to it shall be returned to the Commission for
further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such action. If
approved, the Clerk shall affix his or her signature to five copies of the
preliminary plat with the notation of the date the preliminary plat received
the Council’s tentative approval. One copy shall be returned to the Commission
and three copies shall be returned to the subdivider. The tentative approval by
the Council shall not constitute final acceptance of the addition or
subdivision by the City but an authorization to proceed with preparation of the
final plat.
165.15   EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of
one year at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained. Any
plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void, and
the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative approval
subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.
165.16   COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the required
improvements shall be constructed and either accepted by formal resolution of
the Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between subdivider and the City.
165.17   PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in part
if the subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing
that improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one year
from final acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not
constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed.
Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency, and manner of execution. Upon recommendation of the Commission,
the Council may extend the completion date set forth in the bond for a maximum
period of one additional year.
165.18   FINAL PLAT.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved,
and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop
at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements
of these regulations.
165.19   REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.
The following graphic and descriptive material is required to be provided on
the final plat and in the accompanying material.
1.   Contents of the Final Plat. Every plat of a subdivision offered for record
shall conform to all of the following provisions where applicable:
   A.   The plat shall be a permanent copy or a photographic print made on a
stable plastic film. Exact copies of the plat to be recorded shall be provided
to and filed with the County Recorder, Assessor, and Auditor. The original plat

outside the corporate limits of the City, the Clerk shall refer one copy of the
final plat to the County Board of Supervisors.
165.22   ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
The Commission shall, upon receiving the final plat, as soon as possible, but
within 30 days of receiving the final plat, consider the final plat, and if the
same is recommended for approval, shall submit its recommendation of approval

returned to the subdivider.
165.23   ACTION BY THE COUNCIL.
Upon receipt of the certification by the Commission, the Council shall, within
60 days, either approve or disapprove the final plat.
1.   Disapproval of Plat. In the event that said plat is disapproved by the
Council, such disapproval shall be expressed in writing and shall point out
wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
2.   Acceptance of Plat. In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable
and in accordance with this chapter, the Council shall accept the same.
3.   Final Approval and Recording of Plat. The passage of a resolution by the
Council accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting of
the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause such
plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder, and shall file
satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk before the
City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.
165.24   RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
1.   Procedure for Resubdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.   Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision
plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller
building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land
allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such
streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
165.25   COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Council’s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary sewer, water, and
other improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the final
plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate the same to the City,
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public
improvements thus dedicated.
165.26   PERFORMANCE BOND.
The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation,
and dedication of the incomplete portion of required improvements. In addition:
1.   Approved by City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to
form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations.
2.   Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must be
completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
3.   Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved by
the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council
an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period
of one additional year. The Council may at any time during the period of such
bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
4.   Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of
temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Council. Prior to the construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed.
5.   Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no performance
bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period
specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has
been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms
of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
165.27   INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
shall be issued until all fees are paid. The subdivider shall furnish the
Council with a construction schedule prior to the commencement of any and all
construction, and notify the City not less than 24 hours in advance of
readiness for required inspections.
165.28   RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND.
The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:
1.   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The Council will not accept
dedication of required improvements, nor release or reduce a performance bond,
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant’s
engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed “as built”
plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other
information required by the City, that all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the subdivision.
2.   Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the
public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the
plat.
165.29   MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
1.   Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance. The applicant shall be
required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until
acceptance of said improvements by the Council.
2.   Maintenance Bond. The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance
bond with the Council, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by
the Council and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure
the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of two
years after the date of their acceptance by the Council and dedication of same
to the Council.
165.30   DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
1.   Waiver of Required Improvements. The Council may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests
of the public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
2.   Deferral of Required Improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the
Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of
incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting
facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her share of
the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval of the
final plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said
improvements upon demand of the City.
165.31   IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by these
regulations in accordance with the specifications and under the supervision of
the Council and to its satisfaction.
165.32   DESIGN STANDARDS ARE MINIMUM.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of the subdivision, the subdivider shall use standards
consistent with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant,
and durable neighborhood.
165.33   CONFORMANCE TO APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS.

subdivision is not in conformance with the above guides or policy and purposes
of these regulations.
165.34   SUBDIVISION NAME.
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Council, after consultation with the Commission,
shall have the final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which
shall be determined at preliminary plat approval.
165.35   MONUMENTATION.
Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
1.   Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments. Prior to the offering of the
plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior
establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the
boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent
control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two permanent
control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided into lots
is less than a block in size, at least two permanent control monuments shall be
established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments shall be
constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and
capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.
The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed
or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the
top of the monument.
2.   Other Monuments of Record. Other monuments established prior to the
recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be
considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original
permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their
original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded
according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in
Subsection 1 of this section.
3.   Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments. Monuments other than the
permanent control monuments required in Subsection 1 of this section shall not
be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the
conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the registered land surveyor
includes in the surveyor’s statement on the plat that the additional monuments
required by these regulations shall be established before a specified future
date.
4.   Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be constructed
and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments
prescribed in Subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set in all of the
following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or
subsequent to such recording:
   A.   At every corner and angle point of every lot, block, or parcel of land
created.
   B.   At every point of intersection of the outer boundary of the subdivision
with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street, railroad, or other
way.
   C.   At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve
on every right-of-way line established.
5.   Placement of Monument. When the placement of a monument required by this
chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to
establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.
If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and
its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the
same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring
monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument
shall be confirmed by the surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a
monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.
165.36   CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due
to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth
formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both,
shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider and approved by the Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.
165.37   LOTS.
The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.

permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
2.   Street Access. Each lot shall be provided with satisfactory access to a
public street.
3.   Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least 10 feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be
provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
4.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
5.   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
6.   Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall be
shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Council may require building lines in accordance with
the needs of each subdivision.

approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted.
3.   Topography and Arrangement. Streets shall be in conformance with the
following requirements related to topography and arrangement:
   A.   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at
or above the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of these regulations.
   B.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
   C.   All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping
centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed
land uses.
   D.   Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
   E.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
   F.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
4.   Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads. Whenever any part of a
subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County
jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the
appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the
standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
5.   Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot access
to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
   A.   Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
   B.   A series of cul-de-sacs entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
   C.   A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
6.   Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets
shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Council and Commission.
7.   Street Name Signs. Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections
within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be
approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name signs. The
applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final subdivision approval
the estimated cost of installation of each street sign required by the Council.
8.   Street Lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Council.
9.   Construction of Streets and Dead-end Streets. Streets and dead-end streets
shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
   A.   Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T or L shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
   B.   Permanent Dead-end Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than 150 feet. However, the Council may require the reservation
of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street in accordance with City construction standards and
specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited
in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
165.40   STREETS – DESIGN STANDARDS.
The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:
1.   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards
for streets are hereby required:
   A.   A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets, and 75 feet on
municipal service streets.
   B.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for municipal
service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as the
Council shall determine for special cases.
   C.   Minimum Roadway and Right-of-way Standards:
      (1)   Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 44 feet.
      (2)   Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 60 feet and a roadway width of not less than 36 feet.
      (3)   Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 50 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
      (4)   Frontage streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less than
40 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
      (5)   Cul-de-sacs shall meet all the requirements for a municipal service
street and, in addition, shall provide a turnaround with a right-of-way radius
of 50 feet and a roadway radius of 40 feet. No cul-de-sac shall exceed 500 feet
in length.
   D.   Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following:
      (1)   Municipal arterial streets – six percent;
      (2)   Municipal collector streets – eight percent;
      (3)   Municipal service streets – 10 percent;
      (4)   Frontage streets – six percent.
   E.   All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to 20 times the algebraic difference in percents
of grade.
   F.   No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
2.   Street Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer, water, and other utilities
to be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed by the
applicant, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or
cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations.
Said surfacing shall be of Portland concrete cement. Adequate provisions shall
be made for culverts, drains, and bridges. All road pavement, shoulders,
drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall
conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted by the City,
and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted
by the developer for plat approval.
3.   Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
4.   Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited
access highways were so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands
shall be treated as follows:
   A.   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
“This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is
prohibited.”
   B.   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
   C.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
5.   Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
   A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at
least 100 feet therefrom. No more than two streets shall intersect at any one
point unless specifically approved by the Council.
   B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet
shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual
drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect
major streets, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersection of major
streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
   C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service
streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a municipal collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
   D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a distance of
60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
   E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
   F.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent or less.
6.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of his or her
land developed and so served.
7.   Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all
subdividers:
   A.   Alleys may be prohibited in residential districts.
   B.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading,
and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
   C.   Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet and a roadway
width of not less than 20 feet.
   D.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
   E.   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
8.   Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions shall apply
to street dedications and reservations:
   A.   Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate
or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half street is adjacent
to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within his or her own subdivision boundaries.
   B.   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at his or her expense such
areas for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and
streets shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own
expense to the full width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land
reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area
requirements of the zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated to
the City in fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
165.41   STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
1.   General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval any
plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water run-off channels or basins. The stormwater drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block.
2.   Nature of Stormwater Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
   A.   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall install
storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance,
adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of stormwaters, subject to
the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions containing lots
less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and industrial districts,
underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed throughout the
subdivisions and be conducted to an approved outfall.
   B.   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as
determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangement for future
stormwater disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
   C.   A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough
to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether
inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the necessary
size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
   D.   The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City
drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall
serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
   E.   The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or
welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the
conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the flood plain of
any stream or drainage course.
3.   Dedication of Drainage Easements. The following shall apply to the
dedication of drainage easements.
   A.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
   B.   Drainage easements:
      (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
      (2)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
      (3)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.
      (4)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the area requirement of any lot.
165.42   WATER FACILITIES.
Water facilities shall be provided as follows:
1.   General Requirements. The following general requirements shall apply to
the provision of water facilities:
   A.   Where a public water main is accessible the subdivider shall install
adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to City
specifications. All water mains shall be at least six inches in diameter.
   B.   Water main extensions shall be approved by the City.
   C.   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants and all
water supply improvements shall be shown on the preliminary plat and final
plat.
2.   Individual Wells and Central Water Systems. The following requirements
shall apply to the provision of individual wells and central water systems:
   A.   In the discretion of the Council, if a public water system is not
available, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in
such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to
every lot in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the
appropriate County or State agency for testing, and individual wells and
central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate County or State
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the Council.
   B.   If the Council requires that a connection to a public water main be
eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or central
water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water service at
the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds may be
required to insure compliance.
3.   Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions except
those coming under Subsection 2 of this section. Fire hydrants shall be located
no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any structures and shall
be approved by the City.
165.43   SEWAGE FACILITIES.
Sewage facilities shall be provided as follows:
1.   General Requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the City construction standards and
specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules,
regulations, and standards of the City and the State Department of Natural
Resources or State Department of Health. Plans shall be approved by the above
agencies.
2.   Construction of Sanitary Sewage Systems. Sanitary sewage systems shall be
constructed as follows:
   A.   Where a public sanitary sewage system is reasonably accessible, the
applicant shall connect with the same and provide sewers accessible to each lot
in the subdivision.
   B.   Where public sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and
will not become available within a reasonable time, not to exceed 15 years, the
applicant may choose one of the following alternatives:
      (1)   Install a central sewage system, operated and maintained by the
benefited property owners. Where plans for future public sanitary sewage
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals, and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains.
      (2)   Individual disposal systems, provided the applicant shall install
sanitary sewer lines, laterals and mains from the street curb to a point in the
subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public sewer main shall
be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the street line, and a
connection shall be available in the home to connect from the individual
disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers become available.
Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready to use and shall conform to all
plans for installation of the public sewer system, where such exist, and shall
be ready for connection to such public sewer main.
   C.   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will not
become available for a period in excess of 15 years, the applicant shall
install individual disposal systems or central sewage systems.
3.   Individual Disposal System Requirements. If public sewer facilities are
not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot areas
shall conform to the requirements of applicable zoning regulations and these
regulations. Percolation tests and test holes shall be made as directed by the
City and the results submitted to the local board of health.
4.   Water Supply Interconnections. There shall be no physical connection
between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer which will
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other water supply
sources and structures.
165.44   SIDEWALKS.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of sidewalks:
1.   Location. Sidewalks, if provided in the plat, shall be included within the
dedicated non-pavement right-of-way of all streets.
2.   Construction. Sidewalks shall be improved as required in Subsection 2 of
Section
165.40 of these regulations.
165.45   UTLITIES.
The following shall apply to the provision of utilities:
1.   Location. The Council may require that all utility facilities, including,
but not limited to, gas, electric power, telephone, and CATV cables, be located
underground throughout the subdivision. All utility facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot
shall be installed at the subdivider's expense. At the discretion of the
Council, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in
the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to
be developed for the same primary use.
2.   Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
   A.   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities.
Such easements shall be at least 10 feet wide. Proper coordination shall be
established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the
establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
   B.   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 10 feet in width shall be provided alongside lot lines with
satisfactory access to the street or rear lot lines. Easements shall be
indicated on the plat.
165.46   PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the
City as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic
spots. and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of
the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change
of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been
granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and
all trees where required shall be protected against change of grade.
165.47   NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
1.   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in City plans
and regulations.
2.   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
   A.   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to
the types of industrial development anticipated.
   B.   Streets rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the
type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
   C.   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to street,
curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
   D.   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
drainage.
   E.   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
   F.   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
165.48   SCHOOL AND PARK RESERVATIONS.
If land to be subdivided contains sites that are designated in City plans or
plans of other public bodies to be used for schools or parks, the developer
shall reserve such site for such use. If sites which have been reserved are not
acquired by the City or other public body within two years of the date of the
preliminary plat approval, then such sites may be subdivided by the developer.
The appropriate public body may release the reserved site sooner by certifying
to the Council that it does not intend to acquire such site within the two year
period.
165.49   IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTION.
Improvements in the two mile unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of
these regulations shall be the same as required herein, provided they are not
less than that required by the applicable County subdivision regulations, and
provided further that all construction plans shall be approved by the County,
and completed public roads shall be accepted by the Board of Supervisors for
public maintenance.
165.50   VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
The following shall apply to the granting of variations and exceptions:
1.   Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided, the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
   A.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
   B.   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
   C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out.
   D.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
make more money out of the property.
2.   Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3.   Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all
of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
165.51   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice
of which shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments
shall first be submitted to the Commission for study and recommendation before
the hearing is held. The Commission shall forward its recommendations to the
Council within 30 days, after which the Council shall give notice of and hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment.
165.52   ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS, AND PENALTIES.
No plat or subdivision within the City or within two miles thereof shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth, and further:
1.   Issuance of Building Permits. No more than two building permits for each
separate tract existing at the time of the effective date of these regulations
shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in accordance with these
regulations; except that this provision shall not limit the number of building
permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as defined by applicable
land use regulations such as zoning and restricted residence regulations or
additions or improvements to a main or accessory building already legally
located upon said tract.
2.   Sale or Lease Without Plat. Any person who shall dispose of or offer for
sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the City, until the plat
thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in these regulations,
shall forfeit and pay $50.00 for each lot and part of lot sold or disposed of,
leased or offered for sale.

GENERAL PROVISIONS AND DEFINITIONS
170.01   PLAN ADOPTED.
There is hereby established a new comprehensive zoning plan for the City of
Sanborn, Iowa, which plan is set forth in the text, maps, and descriptions
which constitute this chapter. Said plan is adopted by the authority of and for
the purposes set forth in Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa, and amendments
thereto. This chapter shall be known and referred to as the “Zoning Ordinance.”
170.02   ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONES.
In carrying out the provisions of Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa, the Planning
and Zoning Commission and the City Council have divided the City into districts
and have prepared regulations pertaining to such districts in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan and designed to lessen congestion on the streets; to
secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote health and
general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding
of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the
adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and
other public requirements.
170.03   ZONES LISTED.

1.   The boundaries of the zones, except where otherwise referenced, are
intended to follow the lines of platted lots, center lines of streets and
alleys, and when lines appear to be not more than 10 feet from the line of a
platted lot, the boundary shall be interpreted as being coincidental therewith.
2.   When boundaries cross unplatted property or platted lots otherwise than
set forth above, and their distances are not clearly marked, their location
shall be determined by use of the scale of the map and every such line shall be
interpreted to fall on the nearest multiple of 10 feet.

yard or open space for any use, building or structure shall be contained in the
same zone as required for the principal use, its buildings or accessory
buildings.
2.   No lot, yard, off-street parking space, or other open space required for
an existing building by the regulations contained herein shall hereafter be
reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein
for said building or structure, except to provide for the extension,
establishment, or widening of a public street or highway.

zone, provided they are normally required for a use permitted in the zone in
which they are erected or constructed: flagpoles, chimneys, cooling towers,
elevator bulkheads, belfries, penthouses (for other than living purposes),
grain elevators, stacks, silos, storage towers, observation towers, ornamental
towers, monuments, cupolas, domes, spires, standpipes, and other necessary
mechanical appurtenances and their protective housing, provided however, that
any of the above except flagpoles and chimneys when located in any zone with a
height limit of 40 feet or less, shall be allowed only upon finding of the
Board of Adjustment that such appurtenances will not be unduly detrimental to
the surrounding property.
170.22   HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS; ELECTRONIC TOWERS.
Radio, television, microwave, and other electronic transmission or receiving
towers in excess of height limits may be allowed in any zone as a special
exception upon the finding by the Board of Adjustment that topographic or other
considerations make it necessary that they be located outside a zone where they
are permitted as a matter of right and that the proposed tower or towers will
not be unduly detrimental to surrounding property. Exceptions to height
restrictions shall not be granted in cases where they would violate height
restrictions of an aircraft approach and turning zone.
170.23   YARD SPACE; GENERAL RULE.
Any building, structure, or use hereafter erected, altered, or established
shall comply with the yard space requirements of the zone in which it is
located except as specified below. The required yard space for any building or
structure or use shall be contained on the same zoning lot as the building or
structure or use, and such required yard space shall fall entirely upon land in
a zone or zones where the principal use is permitted. Any required yard space,
as determined at the setback line, shall be open from 30 inches above the
ground for the sky except as specified herein.
170.24   YARD SPACE ENCROACHMENTS; EAVES.
Cornices and similar features may extend one foot into a required yard space.
Eaves may extend three feet into a yard space when such yard space is 10 feet
or more in width.
170.25   YARD SPACE ENCROACHMENTS; CHIMNEYS.
Chimneys may extend two feet into any yard space when such yard is 10 feet or
more in width, but shall not encroach upon a yard space of a lesser width.
170.26   YARD SPACE ENCROACHMENT; PORCHES AND TERRACES.
Open, uncovered porches or terraces, no higher than 30 inches above grade of
the lot on the side of the building where such porch or terrace is located, may
extend into any required yard. No railing or other barrier higher than 36
inches shall be placed around such porch or terrace and no such barrier which
interferes appreciably with the passage of light or air shall be within five
feet of any property line, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. Any
such porch or terrace when located on a lot at the intersection of two streets
or a street and an alley shall comply with the provisions designed to insure
proper sight distances as set forth in this chapter for fences and hedges.
170.27   YARD SPACE ENROACHMENTS; REAR YARD.
Accessory buildings or structures shall be permitted to occupy a required yard
with the following restrictions:
1.   No such accessory structure shall be greater than 15 feet in height nor be
closer than 20 feet from any street or alley line.
2.   An accessory structure may be constructed within two feet of an inside lot
line when the entire structure is within 40 feet of the rear property line.
170.28   LOT AREA EXCEPTION; EXISTING PLATTING.
A single-family dwelling may be built on any platted lot of record containing
75 percent of the required lot area for the district in which the lot is
located if said lot was in separate ownership and separate control at the
effective date of these regulations, provided the front, side, and rear yard
requirements for the district in which the lot is located are met. It is not
the intention of this exception to allow building as a matter of right on a
platted parcel which was never intended as a building site, but rather was
numbered on a plat for identification purposes under a scheme in which multiple
lots were intended to provide one building site.
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of these regulations, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of these regulations, and
no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter,
nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or
area below the requirements stated in this chapter.
FENCES AND HEDGES
170.30   FENCE NOT A STRUCTURE.
For the purposes of this chapter, fences shall not be classified as a structure
but shall be deemed a separate and distinct use of the land so as to allow
their placement on a portion of a lot in which a structure or accessory
building may not be located.
170.31   CORNER VISIBILITY.
Except in a Central General Business Zone, there shall be provided an
unobstructed view across a triangle formed by joining points measured 20 feet
distant along the property line from the intersection of two streets, or 15
feet along both the street and the alley line from the intersection of a street
and an alley. Within said triangle there shall be no sight obscuring or partly
obscuring wall, fence, or foliage higher than 30 inches above grade or in the
case of trees, foliage lower than five feet.
170.32   OTHER THAN CORNER.
On portions of a lot not covered by street or alley intersection restrictions,
the height of fences of any length and foliage continuous for five feet or more
shall be limited to 42 inches on any street line and the front 50 feet of any
side lot line. On all other portions of lot lines, fences, hedges and
continuous foliage barriers may not exceed a height of 80 inches.
170.33   MEASUREMENT RULE.
Heights of fences, hedges, and other continuous foliage shall be measured from
the adjacent top of the street curb, surface of an alley, or the official
established grade thereof, whichever is the highest. On inside lot lines the
measurement shall be from the average grade thereof, whichever is the higher.
On inside lot lines the measurement shall be from the average grade of the lot
line of the parcel or property having the lower elevation.
170.34   EXCEPTION; BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
The Board of Adjustment may approve, or may direct as a condition for granting
an appeal, that fences or plantings of a height in excess of these regulations
be placed as screening between different uses, or between like uses upon
agreement between the parties affected thereby, provided that no such approval
shall have the effect of reducing corner visibility as provided for herein.
170.35   FENCES; LOCATION OF.
Fences or foliage may be placed within the required setback in any zoning
district at the distance specified from the property line for that district.
This shall not exempt a fence or foliage from the corner visibility requirement
as specified in Section
170.31, nor the height restrictions of Section
170.32. A fence or hedge may be built closer to the property line than the
distance specified in Section
170.36 if a written agreement is signed by the adjacent property owners and
presented to the Zoning Officer. Such agreement must state provisions for the
maintenance and erection of any fence or hedge located within the distance
specified in Section
170.36.

   A.   Off-street loading shall be provided for all new buildings. Off-street
parking may be provided by governmental or group action. It is not desired that

shielded so as to light only the property of such establishments.
   F.   Light retail establishments such as: apparel, drug, variety, florist,
gift, grocery, jewelry, small appliances, bakery, and dairy; provided, however,

subordinate to a permitted use in the HSB District including, but not limited
to, the following:
   A.   Accessory uses for residential development shall include those listed
under the RD-60 District and shall be established and conducted in accordance
with the regulations of that district.

170.54   ML – LIGHT MANUFACTURING DISTRICT.
1.   Intent. This district provides for a wide range of commercial and
industrial uses, all of which shall be able to meet comparatively rigid
specifications as to nuisance-free performance. The district specifically
excludes residences on the theory that the mixture of residential use, and the
public service and facilities for residences with those for industry is
contrary to the purposes of these regulations irrespective of whether the
industry is encroaching on a living area or a living area is encroaching on an
industrial area.
2.   Permitted Uses. The following uses are permitted in the ML District:
   A.   Any use allowed in the CGB District, except that all dwellings and
other types of living accommodations shall be prohibited save that one quarters
for a guard or caretaker shall be permitted as an accessory use for any
permitted use occupying more than 20,000 square feet of lot area.
   B.   Any business, commercial, or industrial use which can meet the
performance standards set forth for this district but not specifically excluded
or specifically mentioned as belonging in another less restrictive district.

   D.   Motels, hotels, and mobile home parks.
   E.   Any use not enumerated as permitted in this district but which is
specifically provided for in another district or districts.
4.   Accessory Uses. Uses of land or structure customarily incidental and
subordinate to a permitted use in the ML District:
   A.   Any accessory use normally appurtenant to a permitted use shall be
allowed provided such use shall conform with all performance standards set
forth for this district.
5.   Special Exceptions. Certain uses may be permitted in the ML District
subject to specific conditions and requirements intended to make them
compatible with and acceptable to adjacent uses.
   A.   Recreation uses which are temporary in nature and do not involve any
appreciable amount of fixed construction and which will not interfere with the
efficient functioning of the district for its primary purpose of providing for
manufacturing and heavy commercial establishments, may be allowed only upon
appeal to the Board of Adjustment.
6.   Performance Standards. The following performance standards shall apply in
the ML District:
   A.   Physical Appearance. All operations shall be carried on within an
enclosed building except that new materials or equipment in operable condition
may be stored in the open. Normal daily wastes of an inorganic nature may be
stored in containers not in a building when such containers are not readily
visible from the street. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed to prohibit the display of merchandise or vehicles for sale or the
storage of vehicles, boats, farm machinery, trailers, mobile homes, or similar
equipment when in operable condition.
   B.   Fire Hazard. No operation shall involve the use of highly flammable
gases, acid, liquors, grinding processes, or other inherent fire hazards. This
provision shall not be construed to prohibit the use of normal heating fuels
and welding gases when handled in accordance with other ordinances of the City.
   C.   Noise. No operation shall be carried on which involves noise in excess
of the normal traffic noise of the adjacent street at the time of the daily
peak hour of traffic volume. Noise shall be measured at the property line. When
the level of such noise cannot be determined by observation with the natural
senses, a suitable instrument may be used and measurement may include breakdown
into a reasonable number of frequency ranges. All noises shall be muffled so as
to not be objectionable due to intermittence, beat, frequency, or shrillness.
   D.   Sewage and Liquid Wastes. No operation shall be carried on which
involves the discharge into a sewer, water course or the ground of liquid
wastes of any radioactive nature, or liquid wastes of a chemical nature which
are detrimental to normal sewage plant operation or corrosive and damaging to
sewer pipes and installations.
   E.   Air Contaminants.
      (1)   Air contaminants and smoke shall be less dark than designated
Number One on the Ringleman Chart as published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines,
except that smoke of a density designated as Number One shall be permitted for
one four minute period in each one-half hour. Light-colored contaminants of
such an opacity as to obscure an observer’s view to a degree equal to or
greater than the aforesaid shall not be permitted.
      (2)   Particulate matter of dust as measured at the point of emission by
any generally accepted method shall not be emitted in excess of two-tenths
grains per cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
except for a period of four minutes in any one-half hour, at which time it may
equal but not exceed six-tenths grains per cubic foot as corrected to a
temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
      (3)   Due to the fact that the possibilities of air contaminants cannot
reasonably be comprehensively covered in this section, there shall be applied
the general rule that there shall not be discharged from any sources whatsoever
such quantities of air contaminants or other material in such quality as to
cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of
persons or to the public in general or to endanger the comfort, repose, health,
or safety of any such considerable number of persons or to the public in
general or to cause or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to
business, vegetation, or property.
   F.   Odor. The emissions of odors that are generally agreed to be obnoxious
to any considerable number of persons shall be deemed that strong odors of
putrefaction and fermentation tend to be obnoxious and that such odors as
associated with baking or the roasting of nuts and coffee shall not normally be
considered obnoxious within the meaning of this chapter.
   G.   Gases. The gases sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide shall not exceed
five parts per million; carbon monoxide shall not exceed five parts per
million. All measurements shall be taken at the zoning lot line.
   H.   Vibration. All machines, including punch presses and stamping machines,
shall be so mounted as to minimize vibration and in no case shall such
vibration exceed a displacement of three thousandths of an inch measured at the
zoning lot line. The use of steam or broad hammers shall not be permitted in
this district.
   I.   Glare and Heat. All glare, such as welding arcs and open furnaces,
shall be shielded so that they shall not be visible from the zoning lot line.
No heat from furnaces or processing equipment shall be sensed at the zoning lot
line to the extent of raising the temperature of air or materials more than
five degrees Fahrenheit.

that may later be adopted there exist:
   A.   Lots.
   B.   Structures.
   C.   Uses of land and structures.
   D.   Characteristics of use which were lawful before these regulations were
adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intent of this
chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but
not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, not be uses
as grounds for adding other structures, or uses prohibited elsewhere in the
same district.
2.   Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a
nonconforming use of land, or nonconforming use of a structure and land in
combination shall not be extended or enlarged after adoption of these
regulations by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs
intended to be seen from off the premises or by the addition of other uses of a
nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
3.   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of these regulations and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal
of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
4.   Nonconforming Uses of Land (or Land with Minor Structures Only). Where at
the time of adoption of these regulations lawful use of land exists which would
not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where such use
involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000.00,
the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
   A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of these regulations.
   B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations.
   C.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land
is located.
   D.   No additional structures not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
5.   Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of these regulations that could not be built
under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions or area, lot
coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   B.   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its
replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Should such structure be moved for any reasons for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
6.   Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Premises in
Combination. If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement
cost of $1,000.00 or more, or of structures and premises in combination, exists
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations that would
not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   C.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as special exception be changed to
another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of
Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the
provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
   E.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months (except
when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or
structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   F.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purposes of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent (or other
figure) of the replacement cost at the time of destruction.
7.   Repairs and Maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a
structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-
bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10
percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the
structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it
became nonconforming shall not be increased.
8.   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe
or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
9.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
10.   Uses Under Special Exception Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use which is
permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms of this chapter
(other than a change through Board of Adjustment action from a nonconforming
use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed
a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be
considered a conforming use.

effective date of this chapter is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of
employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise to create a
need for an increase of two percent or more in the number of existing parking
spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or
change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective date of this

chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. Business of the
Board shall be conducted in accordance with these regulations set forth herein
and with the provisions of Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa, and amendments
thereto. The Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure in harmony with said
provisions. The chairperson, or in their absence the acting chairperson, may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings shall be
open to the public.
5.   Records. The Board shall keep minutes of all meetings, containing the
substance of testimony and detailed findings and showing the vote of each
member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indication of such
fact, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board and
shall be a public record. The concurring vote of two-thirds of all of the
members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Officer or to decide in
favor of the applicant or any matter upon which the Board is required to pass
under this chapter or to allow any variation to the strict interpretation of
this chapter. No order or finding of the Board shall become effective until the
eighth day following the posting of a copy of such ruling or finding, duly
attested by the Zoning Officer, upon a public bulletin board in the City Hall
and transmittal of duplicate copies to the City Clerk and to the Chief
Administrative Officer of the Commission. The City Clerk shall serve as a
secretary to the Board and keep its records.
6.   Appeal. Appeal to the Board may be taken within 30 days after an order
becomes effective, by any person or persons aggrieved or by any officer,
department, board, or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the Zoning
Officer.
7.   Jurisdiction. The Board shall have powers to make rulings in the following
situations:
   A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirements, decisions, or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of these zoning regulations.
   B.   To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms
of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to
a special condition a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter
would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the chapter
shall be observed and substantial justice done.
   C.   Hear applications for special exception permits and make requisite
findings precedent to authorization as required by this chapter and by Chapter
414 of the Code of Iowa and amendments thereto.
   D.   To make rulings from the advice of the Zoning Officer in cases where
uses are found to exist which are not specifically mentioned in this chapter,
and to specify the zones in which such new uses may properly fall, until such
time as such uses shall be specifically treated by amendment to this chapter.
It is the intention of the Council in adopting these regulations that all uses
of land, performance standards and requirements as to the placement and sizes
of buildings specifically treated in this chapter are so designated to conform
with a Comprehensive Plan within the meaning of Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, and amendments thereto. Any changes in the application of this chapter
which would have the effect of changing the zoning classification of any parcel
of property other than through application of specific provisions of this
chapter are deemed to be a legislative determination and to fall within the
province of the Council.
8.   Finding, Variances. Before making any rulings on a variance, the Board
shall make all of the following determinations and shall record such
determinations in its proceedings:
   A.   That the appeal falls within the jurisdiction of the Board.
   B.   That all parties directly in interest have been notified of the
proceedings.
   C.   That the granting of the appeal would not have the effect of changing
the intended zoning of the property.
   D.   That the property cannot reasonably be used in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
   E.   That the difficulty complained of is not the result of a willful act of
the petitioner or other person maintaining an interest in property or their
immediate predecessors in interest.
   F.   That the difficulty complained of is unique to the property in question
and is not common to all property similarly situated.
   G.   That balancing the interest of the City in preserving the Comprehensive
Plan or the interest of nearby properties against the interest of the
petitioner in using their property as proposed to be used, the granting of the
variance is required by considerations of justice and equity.
9.   Finding, Special Exceptions. Before authorizing a special exception use,
the Board shall make the following determinations:
   A.   That the appeal falls within the jurisdiction of the Board.
   B.   That all parties directly in interest have been notified of the
proceedings.
   C.   That all specific conditions of this chapter relative to any specific
limitations or conditions necessary to protect the public interest and assure
the continued beneficial use and enjoyment of nearby properties, or that no
special limitations are necessary to protect the public.
   D.   That the special exception with specific limitations and design
features as may have been required will further the aims of the Comprehensive
Plan and will not be unduly detrimental to nearby properties.
   E.   That in the event that opposing interests cannot be resolved, the Board
shall find that balancing the interests of the City in preserving the
Comprehensive Plan or the interests of nearby properties against the interest
of the petitioner in using their property as proposed to be used, the granting
of the special exception permit is required by consideration of justice and
equity.
10.   Notice. The Board shall give sufficient notice to parties affected by any
proceeding and shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations to facilitate such
notice. A copy of each notice shall be transmitted to the City Clerk and to the
office of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
11.   Fees. The Board may adopt a schedule of fees to defray all or part of the
cost of processing an appeal. Said schedule of fees shall be approved by the
Council. All fees shall be payable to the City Clerk and may be deposited with
the City Clerk in a fund determined by the Council.
12.   Termination of Variance. Where property is in use under the terms of a
variance and such use ceases or in the case of a structure such structure
ceases to exist, then the variance shall terminate unless the terms of the
variance specify otherwise.
170.68   APPLICATION FOR BUILDING PERMIT.
1.   After adoption of this chapter, no building permit for the erection,
construction, reconstruction, conversion, alteration, enlargement, extension,
raising, or moving of any building or a part thereof shall be issued before
application has been made for a certificate of occupancy, and no permit shall
be issued unless the plans, specifications, and intended use conform in all
respects to the provisions of this chapter. Blank forms shall be provided by
the Zoning Officer.
2.   Each application shall be accompanied by a plan in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the dimensions of the lot to be built upon, and a licensed
surveyor’s plat of the property if required in the opinion of the Zoning
Officer, the size and location of the buildings to be erected, and such other
information as deemed necessary for the proper enforcement of these zoning
regulations, including type of construction and estimated cost. One copy of
such plans shall be returned to the owner after approval or disapproval of the
project. A careful record of all such applications and plans shall be kept in
the office of the Zoning Officer. The fee for a building permit and certificate
of occupancy shall be as follows:
$10.00 for an estimated cost under $10,000.00
$25.00 for an estimated cost in excess of $10,000.00
If the estimated cost of material only is available, then 50 percent shall be
added for construction costs in connection with computation of the fee.
3.   Any building permit, under which no construction work has been commenced
within six months after the date of issue of said permit, shall expire by
limitation, and no work or operation shall take place under such permit after
such expiration.
170.70   CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
1.   No vacant land shall be used or occupied, and no change made in the use of
land until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Zoning Officer to
the effect that the proposed use is in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. Such certificate of occupancy shall be issued or reasons for refusal
given within 10 days after the application has been made, except in special
cases where recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission and action of
the Council is required.
2.   No building or part thereof hereafter erected or altered in use shall be
occupied or used until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the
Zoning Officer to the effect that the building or part thereof and the proposed
use are in conformity with the provision of this chapter. Such certificate
shall be applied for coincident with the application for the building permit or
prior to any changes or extensions, and shall be issued by the Zoning Officer
within 10 days after completion of the work, provided that it conforms to the
provisions of this chapter.
3.   Pending the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy, a temporary
certificate of occupancy may be issued for a period not to exceed one year,
which may be renewed for buildings other than dwellings. Such temporary
certificates are intended to cover the period of construction or partial
occupation of a building and shall not alter any of the respective rights,
duties, or obligations of the owner or the City. It shall not be issued except
under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure the safety of
the occupants of the building.
4.   Upon application by any tenant or owner, the Zoning Officer shall, after
inspection, issue a certificate of occupancy for any building or land existing
at the time of passage of these regulations.
5.   A certificate of occupancy shall state whether a building or the use of a
building complies with the building and health laws, other ordinances, or with
the provisions of this chapter. A record of all certificates shall be furnished
on request of any person having a proprietary or tenant interest in the
building or land affected. No fee shall be charged for an original or temporary
certificate of occupancy applied for coincident with the application for a
building permit or for an original certificate covering any proposed use or
change in the use of land, but for all other certificates there shall be a
charge of $10.00 each.
170.72   AMENDMENTS.
1.   The Council may from time to time make amendments to the text and maps of
this chapter in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, and amendments thereto. Action may be initiated by the Council, by the
Commission or by a private citizen. The Commission may make reasonable rules
and regulations and fee schedules for the processing of amendments with the
concurrence of the Council.
2.   Any notice specified by said rules and regulations shall be in addition to
that specified by Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa, and amendments thereto, and
proper notice as specified by law shall be deemed to be the sole legal notice
for such changes in the text or map of this chapter as may be hereafter
proposed. It shall be the policy of the City to give as full and adequate
notice as practical to all interested parties and to the general public, but
failure to issue such notice except as specified by the Code of Iowa shall not
invalidate the proceedings.
170.74   INTERPRETATIONS, PURPOSE, AND CONFLICT.
It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any
rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued or which shall be
adopted or issued pursuant to law by a Building Inspector, Zoning Officer,
Health Department, or the Council relating to the use of buildings or premises.
Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or
premises, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other
ordinances, rules, regulations, or permits, the provisions of this chapter
shall govern.
170.76   VIOLATION AND PENALTY.
1.   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects,
or refuses to comply with or resists the enforcement of any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be in violation of this Code of Ordinances. Each day that
the violation is permitted to exist after notification in writing by the Zoning
Officer and the expiration of the time designated in said notice shall
constitute a separate offense.
2.   Any structure erected, raised, converted, or land or premises used in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or the requirements thereof
