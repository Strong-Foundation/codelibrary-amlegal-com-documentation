46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco 46.04 Minors In Bars
Â 
46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.Â Â Â Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œEmergency errandâ€ means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation

of life.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â â€œKnowinglyâ€ means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâ€™s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â â€œMinorâ€ means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â â€œNonsecured custodyâ€ means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the personâ€™s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â â€œPublic placeâ€ includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â â€œResponsible adultâ€ means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
2.Â Â Â Curfew Established. A curfew applicable to minors is established and shall
be enforced as follows:

younger shall be in or remain upon any of the alleys, streets, or public places
or to be in places of business and amusement in the City between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. of the following day.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Unless accompanied by a responsible adult, no minor 15 through 17 years
of age shall be in or remain upon any of the alleys, streets, or public places
or to be in places of business and amusement in the City between the hours of
midnight and 5:00 a.m. of the following day.
3.Â Â Â Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.

Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one

knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minorâ€™s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.Â Â Â Enforcement Procedures.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driverâ€™s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the personâ€™s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minorâ€™s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.Â Â Â Penalties.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable

information that an animal has bitten a person or that a dog or animal is
suspected of having rabies, the City Veterinarian shall order the owner to
confine such animal in isolation under quarantine for 14 days. In the event the

Â 
56.01Â Â Â DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:
1.Â Â Â â€œAggressive dogâ€ means a dog that has two verified incidents of unprovoked
chasing, snapping, or barking at any person or domestic animal so as to place
the person or owner of the domestic animal in reasonable fear of their safety
or the safety of their animal. A dog may be considered aggressive even if on
the property of its owner, whether leashed or not, if its behavior, snapping,
or barking, or similar menacing behavior is founded after investigation by the
Police Department. In assessing whether the dog was provoked to exhibit its
aggression, the Police Department shall consider that fact from the standpoint
of a reasonable person of the age of the person alleged to have provoked the
dog; in other words, the Police Department shall consider whether a reasonable
person of the age of the person alleged to have provoked the dog knew, or
should reasonably have known, their action would provoke the aggressive
behavior on the part of the dog.
2.Â Â Â â€œDangerous animalâ€ means  â€  :
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Badgers, wolverines, weasels, skunk and mink;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Raccoons;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Bats;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Scorpions.
2.Â Â Â â€œVicious animalâ€ means any animal, except for a dangerous animal as listed
above, that has attacked, bitten or clawed a person while running at large and
the attack was unprovoked, or any animal that has exhibited vicious tendencies
in present or past conduct, including such that said animal: (i) has bitten
more than one person during the animalâ€™s lifetime; or (ii) has bitten one
person on two or more occasions during the animalâ€™s lifetime; or (iii) has
attacked any domestic animal or fowl without provocation, causing injury or
death while off the property of the owner. To constitute a bite, it is not
necessary that the skin of the victim, whether human or domesticated animal or
fowl, be broken. Rather, as long as the animal seizes its victim with its
teeth, it shall be considered to have bitten its victim.
Â 
Notes
  â€ Â EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Certain other dangerous animals, listed in Chapter 717F.1,
â€paragraph 5a, of the Code of Iowa, are specifically prohibited and regulated by
  the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.
56.02Â Â Â KEEPING OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS PROHIBITED.
No person shall keep, shelter, or harbor any dangerous dog, cat, or animal as a
pet, or act as a temporary custodian for such animal, or keep, shelter, or
harbor such animal for any purpose or in any capacity within the City.
56.03Â Â Â KEEPING OF VICIOUS ANIMALS PROHIBITED.
No person shall keep, shelter or harbor for any reason within the City a
dangerous, vicious, or aggressive dog, cat, or animal within the City. It is
the duty of all animal control officers, the City Veterinarian and all peace
officers to impound any such animal. In the event the animal cannot be
impounded without exposing the person attempting to impound the animal to
danger or personal injury, the animal may be destroyed. Exceptions to this
section will be made in the following circumstances:
1.Â Â Â Animals under the control of a law enforcement or military agency.
2.Â Â Â The keeping of guard dogs; however, guard dogs must be kept within a
structure or fixed enclosure at all times, and any guard dog found at large may
be processed as a vicious animal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
Any premises guarded by a guard dog shall be prominently posted with a sign
containing the wording â€œGuard Dog,â€ â€œVicious Dogâ€ or words of similar import,
and the owner of such premises shall inform the Mayor or peace officer that a
guard dog is on duty at said premises.
56.04Â Â Â SEIZURE, IMPOUNDMENT AND DISPOSITION.
1.Â Â Â In the event that a dangerous, vicious, or aggressive animal is found at
large and unattended upon public property, park property, public right-of-way,
or the property of someone other than its owner, thereby creating a hazard to
persons or property, such animal may, in the discretion of the Mayor or peace
officer, be destroyed if it cannot be confined or captured. The City shall be
under no duty to attempt the confinement or capture of a dangerous, vicious, or
aggressive animal found at large, nor shall it have a duty to notify the owner
of such animal prior to its destruction.
2.Â Â Â Upon the complaint of any individual that a person is keeping, sheltering
or harboring a dangerous, vicious, or aggressive animal on premises in the
City, the Mayor or peace officer shall cause the matter to be investigated and
if after investigation, the facts indicate that the person named in the
complaint is keeping, sheltering or harboring a dangerous, vicious, or
aggressive animal in the City, the Mayor or peace officer shall order the
person named in the complaint to safely remove such animal from the City or
destroy the animal within three days of the receipt of such an order. Such
order shall be contained in a notice to remove the dangerous, vicious, or
aggressive animal, which notice shall be given in writing to the person
keeping, sheltering or harboring the dangerous, vicious, or aggressive animal,
and shall be served personally or by certified mail. Such order and notice to
remove the dangerous, vicious, or aggressive animal shall not be required where
such animal has previously caused serious physical harm or death to any person,
in which case the Mayor or peace officer shall cause the animal to be
immediately seized and impounded or killed if seizure and impoundment are not
possible without risk of serious physical harm or death to any person.
3.Â Â Â The order to remove a dangerous, vicious, or aggressive animal issued by
the Mayor or peace officer may be appealed to the Council. In order to appeal
such order, written notice of appeal must be filed with the Clerk within three
days after receipt of the order contained in the notice to remove the
dangerous, vicious, or aggressive animal. Failure to file such written notice
of appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal the order of the
Mayor or peace officer.
4.Â Â Â The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal and shall be
delivered personally or by certified mail to the Clerk. The hearing of such
appeal shall be scheduled within seven days of the receipt of the notice of
appeal. The hearing may be continued for good cause. After such hearing, the
Council may affirm or reverse the order of the Mayor or peace officer. Such
determination shall be contained in a written decision and shall be filed with
the Clerk within three days after the hearing or any continued session thereof.
5.Â Â Â If the Council affirms the action of the Mayor or peace officer, the
Council shall order in its written decision that the person owning, sheltering,
harboring, or keeping such dangerous, vicious, or aggressive animal remove such
animal from the City or destroy it. The decision and order shall immediately be
served upon the person against whom rendered in the same manner as the notice
of removal. If the original order of the Mayor or peace officer is not appealed
and is not complied with within three days or the order of the Council after
appeal is not complied with within three days of its issuance, the Mayor or
peace officer is authorized to seize, impound, or destroy such dangerous,
vicious, or aggressive animal. Failure to comply with an order of the Mayor or
peace officer issued pursuant to this chapter and not appealed, or of the
Council after appeal, constitutes a simple misdemeanor.

conditions, impeding or likely to impede the free movement of fire, health,
police, emergency, or other vehicular traffic or otherwise endanger the safety
and welfare of the community, the Mayor, City Administrator, or Director of

private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this
section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to
contest those matters. If the persons receiving notice do not ask for a hearing
or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
10-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders, or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,

publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.

stored in a public garage, whereupon said vehicle shall be released. The amount
of towing charges, and the rate of storage charges by privately owned garages,
shall be established by resolution of the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.06Â Â Â DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.
If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided herein, the police
authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether or not the
motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall dispose of
the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.07Â Â Â DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.
The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is found any
abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose
title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08Â Â Â PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the expense
of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification required, in
accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner of the motor
vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be deposited in the
State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails to realize the
amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply for
reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09Â Â Â DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor vehicle
for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or otherwise demolish such motor
vehicle. A demolisher shall not junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or demolish a
vehicle until the demolisher has obtained the junking certificate issued for

capacity of the water distribution system is not adequate to supply all demands
for water or in the event of an emergency requiring the diversion of water for
such emergency purpose.
90.07Â Â Â WATER PRESSURE.
Water pressure varies throughout the distribution system depending upon the
elevation. Information on pressure at a specific location may be obtained upon
request to the City.
90.08Â Â Â TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE; NOTIFICATION.
The City may interrupt a customerâ€™s water supply with proper notification in
order to make repairs to the system. An effort will be made to provide 24-hour
advance notification of any interruption. In case of emergencies, such as a
main break, mains or services may be shut down without notification. In case of
emergencies the City will use whatever media to inform citizens of said
emergencies as soon as possible.
90.09Â Â Â LOCATION OF WATER FACILITIES.
1.Â Â Â City Owned Facilities. The City will furnish information, as available
from its records, regarding locations of mains, hydrants, valves, and other
fixtures owned by the City. The City will use its employees and tools in this
effort at no cost to the person assisted. The City will assume the location of
its mains, pipes, valves, or other fixtures. It should be understood that after
the location of the facility is established, the City shall expect the facility
to be protected from damage or harm.
2.Â Â Â Privately Owned Water Services, Valves, Etc. This subsection references
private water mains and valves. On such mains and facilities, the City will
make available information, if records are available, to persons who have a
reasonable need for information concerning these mains and facilities from
records on file with the City. Records on private mains and facilities and
similar installations are furnished to the City by the owners or agents of
these mains and facilities. It should be understood that these facilities are
not owned or maintained by the City.
3.Â Â Â Private Curb Stops and Services. Curb stops and service lines are the
responsibility of the property owner to maintain and to keep in an operable
condition. Licensed plumbers may operate curb stop valves for repair purposes
only. Curb stops are to be returned to the position they were found in prior to
the repair. When the water has been shut off by the City or its agent for
nonpayment of water bill, this discontinuance of water service must not be
altered by anyone. (See Section
90.32)
4.Â Â Â Maintenance of Facilities. Whenever it shall come to the attention of the
City that a water service stop box valve (including its stop box cover) is
broken, does not exist, or is otherwise in a dangerous or unsafe condition, the
City will make reasonable efforts to notify the occupant of the premises and,
if different, the customer and the person in whose name the property is taxed.
Such notification will require the immediate repair and restoration of the
facility. The City may terminate water service to the premises until such
repairs are made or, in case such condition poses a hazard to the public or
adjoining property, it may make or cause to be made such repairs as are
necessary. The costs of such termination and repairs, if any, shall be included
in the next water bill and, if not paid, may result in termination of service
to the premises or the certification of such amount as a lien against the
property as with other unpaid water bills. (See Section
92.10)
5.Â Â Â Accuracy or Validity of Records and Locate Time Allotment. The City makes
no assurances to the accuracy or validity of the records or information
regarding the location of private water facilities. Persons shall use their own
discretion when making use of these records on private facilities. The City
will, upon request, provide assistance, at its convenience, in an effort to
locate a private pipe, valve, or fixture. The City may offer locating services
at a fee to be established by the City Council.
90.10Â Â Â WATER AVAILABILITY.
All requests for water service will be evaluated on whether adequate capacity
and pressure is available at the desired location. If adequate service is not
available, alternatives may be provided to the owner to obtain the desired
service.
1.Â Â Â In the event that a property owner makes a request to the City to extend a
City water main to make service to such ownerâ€™s property available, all cost of
the water main extension shall be the responsibility of the party requesting
service, and a City application must be completed before work is started. All
requests for any extension must be presented to the City Council for approval
and acceptance. If the party installs a larger main for further use, and
complies with the City standards, the City may reimburse the party for a
portion of the cost of the completed project.
2.Â Â Â If there is any type of an agreement between City and the party interested
in having service extended, such terms of the agreement shall take precedence
over any section in conflict with the agreement.
3.Â Â Â A property owner outside the corporate limits of the City so situated that
such ownerâ€™s property may be served by the Cityâ€™s waterworks system may apply
to the Council for permission to connect to the waterworks system upon the
terms and conditions stipulated by resolution or ordinance of the Council. Any
such applications for connection to the waterworks system shall be accompanied
by an application to voluntarily annex such property to the City and become a
part thereof. No such application for connection to the waterworks system shall
be granted absent annexation of such property.
90.11Â Â Â UNLAWFUL USE OF CITY-OWNED WATERWORKS SYSTEM.
No person shall injure, destroy, deface, or disturb any portions of the water
distribution system, nor shall any person interfere with or obstruct the water
supply. No person shall allow, nor shall any person make, a tap or connection
to any line in the water distribution system, including any such lines or
fixtures ahead of the meter within a building, without receiving an approved
permit from the City. No person shall operate any water main valves or fire
hydrants without the permission of the City.
90.12Â Â Â UNAUTHORIZED USE OF UN-METERED WATER.
Where a water service has been turned off at the stop box, water main, or
tagged at the meter control valve for any reason, and is subsequently found
turned on without proper authority, the City shall discontinue the water
service. The water service shall not be reactivated until payment is made for
the expense of disconnecting such water service and all delinquent bills. Each
day the unauthorized use of un-metered water continues shall constitute a
separate municipal infraction. The discovery of piping bypassing the meter or
tampering with the meter that would allow unauthorized water to be used on the
premises of a customer is in violation of Chapter 714.4 of the Code of Iowa.
The following charges will be made against the customer in such cases:
1.Â Â Â Cost for removal of piping and all other incidental costs.
2.Â Â Â An estimated bill for water consumption, as determined by the City.
3.Â Â Â A penalty as established by the City. In addition to the above charges,
the Code of Iowa provides for the punishment for each offense by a fine or by
imprisonment in the County jail or by both fine and imprisonment.
90.13Â Â Â WATER SUPPLY TO OTHER PERSONS PROHIBITED.
No occupant or owner of any premises to which water is supplied will be allowed
to supply water to other persons or families, or to permit the same to be
taken, or use or permit the same to be used for any purpose other than stated
in the application. Any consumer violating this rule will be charged double the
usual rates for water (See
Chapter 92) so taken or used and if such extra charge is not paid on demand,
the water will be shut off from such premises.
90.14Â Â Â CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITY; NEGLECT, WASTING WATER,Â FAILURE OF VALVES OR
PIPING.
The customer shall be liable for all water that passes through the meter until
provisions are made for the City to turn off water service or remove the meter.
All water through meters will accurately measure the amount of water supplied
each customer. It shall be a municipal infraction with violators subject to the
provisions of
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances, for any person, entity, or party to
alter, tamper with, or deface any water meter. It shall also be a municipal
infraction for any person, party, or entity to secure City water by routing the
waterâ€™s flow around a water meter to avoid incurring a bill for the water used.
It shall also be a municipal infraction to turn on or remove a tag from a meter
that has been sealed off. When a customer is moving out of a premises and
orders the water meter read on a certain day, the water must be turned off when
the meter is read, unless there is an application already on file from a
prospective customer. The customer shall protect and safeguard water service
pipes and fixtures. The owner, at his expense, must keep service pipes from the
water main and all appurtenances in good working order. The City is not
responsible for service pipes and fixtures. No claims shall be made or
maintained against the City for damages due to the breakage of any service
pipes or appurtenances, or for accidental failure in the supply of water. In
case it is found that water is wasted on account of negligence or for the want
of repairs, notice thereof shall be left with the owner, agent, or occupant, or
in case of such personâ€™s absence, posted on said premises; and if such waste is
not remedied within 24 hours thereafter, the water shall be shut off and shall
not be turned on again until proper repairs have been made. In the case of a
ruptured water line, it will be at the discretion of the City to shut the
service off immediately. In case of non-working shut off devices, the City
reserves the right to excavate the shut off device immediately and make
necessary repairs to prevent water loss. The property owner or owners will
cover all said expenses of the emergency. The customer shall operate valves and
other appurtenances of such customerâ€™s water piping system in such manner that
pressure surges are not transmitted to the City water distribution system.
90.15Â Â Â WATER LEAK REPAIRS.
If a water leak should occur, the plumber shall make verbal contact with the
City or its agent previous to any excavation (See Section
90.28). Water leaks shall have priority and must be repaired immediately, or
the City may discontinue water service. All non-leak type of repairs or
disconnects will be completed within six months of the date of notification.
90.16Â Â Â APPLICATION.
Applications for the use of water shall be made in writing on forms provided by
the City and shall be signed by the customer. Application process shall follow
City policy regarding same. If there is no water service into the premises, see
Section
90.17.
90.17Â Â Â APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE CONNECTION; REPAIR PERMIT.
No person shall initially connect any water pipes to the City water
distribution system or thereafter repair, abandon, or disconnect the same
unless such person is a qualified licensed plumber or a person employing a
qualified licensed plumber and has first obtained a water permit for the same
from the City Clerk. The City will issue a permit for installation of a water
service from the main up to and including the water meter. Each service must
have its own tap in the water main, with the exception of an approved master
service. (See Section
90.24) No work of any nature shall be done in connection with the tapping of
any water main, or the introduction of water into the premises (public or
private) between the water main and meter, unless a permit has been obtained
from the City for such work. The work authorized by a permit application shall
be started within six months from the date of permit. If a water service work
has not been completed at permit address within six months from the date of the
permit application, the permit will expire and the applicant must re-apply. The
water service line outside of the structure and the connection to the City
water main must be inspected and approved by an agent designated by the City
before any backfill can occur. If the plumber or contractor fails to comply and
covers the line prior to inspection, said plumber or contractor must reopen the
entire line and expose said line for inspection. This will be at the plumberâ€™s
or contractorâ€™s cost. As part of the permit for a new service hook-up to the
system, the property owner must provide the City with the legal description of
the property to be served, the proposed hook-up location, and any multiple
services to the premises. Legal descriptions will not be required for repairs
provided replacement remains as original service line.
90.18Â Â Â CONNECTION FEE.
At the time the City receives a written notification and site plan of a
proposed new service main or alteration to an existing service main, the City
will determine if a connection fee over and above the standard tap charges is
appropriate. A connection fee will be assessed whenever the property being
served is utilizing water capacity in a pipeline for which the City has a
capital cost investment.
90.19Â Â Â PERMITS AND QUALIFIED PLUMBERS.
Operating permits will be granted to practicing State-licensed plumbers only
upon the payment of an annual fee set by the City Council. Permits shall be
renewed each year. There shall be one permit per business. Upon making
application for a permit, the applicant must furnish the City with satisfactory
evidence of the following requirements:
1.Â Â Â Applicant must have minimum of three yearsâ€™ experience as a plumber and
list said experience or be licensed by an adjoining county.
2.Â Â Â Application for permit shall be made in writing to the City and must state
the full name of the applicant, applicantâ€™s place of business, and the firm
name under which the business is carried on.
3.Â Â Â Applicantâ€™s federal I.D. number shall be included in said application.
4.Â Â Â Application must have a copy of the applicantâ€™s â€œIowa Contractor
Registrationâ€ and number.
After application for such permit has been approved and before the same shall
be issued, the party applying for the same shall execute and deposit with the
Clerk a performance bond in the penal sum of $2,500.00, conditioned that such
party will indemnify and save harmless the City from all accidents and damages
caused by any negligence in prosecution and protecting their work, and that
they will restore all earth, pavement, and other materials in and over any
opening they may have made in laying any service pipes or for any other purpose
to as good a state and condition as it was before said opening was made.
Applicant must annually submit to the City a copy of current paid-in-full
liability insurance that covers the plumbing activities of the individual or
business. Said policy must have as a minimum $500,000.00 blanket of coverage.
All plumbers employed by such permit must be experienced in their business and
skilled, practical workers. Any plumber found guilty of a violation of any of
the rules, regulations, or ordinances adopted by the Council shall forfeit the
permit. A forfeiture of the permit of any plumber shall operate as a suspension
of the permit held by said plumberâ€™s co- partner in the same business, or by
any person in his employment.
90.20Â Â Â OBLIGATION OF REGISTERED PLUMBERS.
Any plumbing contractor performing work on the City distribution system must
have a City Operating Permit and provide a street bond to the City. The City
will refuse to recognize any plumber who fails to comply with this section.
Such Bond shall be refunded upon inspection of the completed work.
90.21Â Â Â PLUMBING INSPECTION.
The City or agent will make inspections of any and all work done from the water
main to and including the curb stop prior to the burying of connections or
piping. Inspections between the curb stop and the water meter must also be
inspected before closure by the City or its agent. Inspections must be done
during water department staff hours or an overtime fee shall be charged. The
inspection shall be conducted within two hours of an appointment (during staff
working hours only). The purpose of the inspections is to prevent unsafe or
hazardous conditions and improper plumbing standards which might contaminate or
endanger the water supply. If the inspection reveals unsafe or hazardous
conditions, the City will not allow water service until proper steps have been
taken to correct the problem. If the inspection finds that damage has been
caused to the City water distribution system by the person working on the
system, said system shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the City.
Registered plumbers may operate curb stop valves for repair purposes only. Curb
stops are to be returned to the position they were found in prior to the
repair. When the water has been shut off by the City for nonpayment of water
bill, this discontinuance of water service must not be altered by the plumber.
Refer to Section
90.09(1) for information regarding City-owned appurtenances.
90.22Â Â Â STANDARDS FOR DWELLING UNITS, COMMERCIAL USES, INDUSTRIAL USES, AND
FIRE SERVICES.
The standards outlined in this chapter and Section
91.03 shall apply to dwelling units and all commercial and industrial projects
and larger connecting to the City distribution system. The interpretation of
any section of this chapter,
Chapter 91, and
Chapter 92, or of any difference in sections, when appropriate, shall be made
by the City Administrator. This interpretation shall be binding and controlling
in its application. Before any connection is made to any structure under this
chapter it shall be required that a site plan be submitted indicating exterior
proposed taps, connections, and valves. A load profile or an estimate from the
customerâ€™s engineer shall be submitted to assist the City in properly selecting
and sizing the meter (above a standard three-quarter-inch household meter) for
the proposed facility. If large seasonal flow fluctuations are anticipated, a
load profile must be submitted for each season of the year. The type of meter
installed will be based upon size, service requirements, location of meter, and
other conditions which may exist. Property owners or developers are to
adequately size water lines to their building units.
90.23Â Â Â MULTI-FAMILY DWELLING UNITS AND DUPLEXES.
All duplexes shall have a curb box and curb stop located between one and six
feet outside of the property line of the property to be served for each water
meter. See Figure 2 â€   for water meter location in each dwelling unit and
installed as illustrated in Figures 1 or 3. While it is preferred that each
meter has a curb stop on the property line, it will be acceptable to have one
master curb stop on the property line if:
1.Â Â Â All required water meters are in a common utility room and access to such
area is given to the water department for needed services.
2.Â Â Â Shut-off devices are properly installed before and after meters.
3.Â Â Â All units will have exterior reading devices properly marked for meter
readers.

that have more than five units shall have a water service system designed by an
engineer.
90.25Â Â Â CONNECTION PRIOR TO STREET IMPROVEMENT.
Whenever the Council has ordered any street permanently improved by paving, the
Council shall thereupon notify the Superintendent of the passage of the
resolution of necessity and it shall thereupon be the duty of the
Superintendent to report to the Council the lots and names of the owners
thereof, and the number and location of the required connections from any water
mains or pipes to the curb line of the abutting and adjacent property.
Thereupon the Council shall pass a resolution requiring the respective owners
of said abutting and adjacent properties to make said connections in the manner
required by the City construction standards (See Chapters
148,
149,
165, and
166) and this chapter and fixing the time at which such work should be done.
Notice of the passage of such resolution must be given to property owners at
the same time and in the same manner as the notice provided in Section 384.50
of the Code of Iowa, to install the necessary connection within 30 days after
hearing on said resolution of necessity for said street improvements. If any
owner fails to install such connections and to certify the actual cost thereof
to the Council, the Council shall install such connections and assess the same
to the respective lots in the same manner in which other special assessments
are made.
90.26Â Â Â WATER MAIN TAPS.
Each customer seeking City water service shall be responsible for tapping water
service pipe into the nearest City water main. All taps into water mains shall
be made by or under the direct supervision of the Superintendent and in
accordance with the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
1.Â Â Â Tapping shall only be done by State-licensed plumbers whose work shall be
subject to the supervision and inspection of the City. This includes the
installation of the corporation stop, tee, or tapping sleeve and gate valve at
the main.
2.Â Â Â Taps will be made only after application is completed by a plumbing
contractor and the property owner and all fees as outlined in this chapter,
including a fee of $20.00 for each water main tap, have been paid.
3.Â Â Â Any licensed plumber tapping a City main will be responsible for any leaks
or defects regarding said tap for a period of one year after tap has been made.
4.Â Â Â No new tap shall be installed where a water service or stub-in already

9.Â Â Â Generally taps will be made for services at 45 degree angle above
horizontal in the main directly abutting the entire property to be served.
Taps, one and one-half inches or two inches will be made at a zero- to five-
degree angle. The purpose of the angle is to maintain a proper gooseneck.
10.Â Â Â Taps on the back side of the main will be made only with permission of
the City who will make sure it is properly recorded on the tap card. Tap should
not be located:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Closer than 18 inches from another tap, joint, or pipe fitting;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â On hydrant branches; or
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Within an intersection.
11.Â Â Â An accurate and dimensional sketch showing the exact location of the tap
shall be filed with the Superintendent in such form as the Superintendent shall
require.
12.Â Â Â Prior to covering the water main tap and service lines, the plumber
responsible for the tap and service lines shall contact the City to afford the
Superintendent the opportunity to inspect the water main tap and service lines
to ensure it has been done in accord with the Cityâ€™s construction standards.
Those responsible for covering water main taps and service lines in cases where
the City has not been given notice and the opportunity to inspect same prior to
covering shall be guilty of a municipal infraction and assessed a $350.00
penalty.
13.Â Â Â No more than one house, building, or premises shall be supplied from one
tap unless special written permission is obtained from the Superintendent and
unless provision is made so that each house, building, or premises may be shut
off independently of the other.
14.Â Â Â Tapping in sleeve and valve (TIS and TIV) or tee service connections
shall not be located closer than six feet from another TIS and TIV, pipe joint
or fitting. Minimum size tap allowed is Â¾". Maximum size corporation tap

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Two inches on four-inch main
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Two inches on six-inch main
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Connections larger than two inches will be made by the installation of
a tapping in sleeve and valve at the main, or in a similar manner, as
prescribed by the City. Fire service taps of size equal to the main size
proposed to be tapped may be allowed.
15.Â Â Â A brass corporation stop, of the pattern and weight approved by the
Superintendent, shall be inserted in every tap in the main. The corporation
stop in the main shall be of the same size as the service pipe.
90.27Â Â Â REMOVAL OF TAP OR CONNECTION (STRUCTURE REMOVAL).

according to these rules and regulations. This work shall be performed at the
ownerâ€™s expense by a registered plumbing contractor and inspected by a
representative of the City.
2.Â Â Â Stub-In or Removal of Service. Water service may remain stubbed and capped
into a lot if the service is copper, cast iron, or PVC, and the valve shut off
is 100 percent. The lot must be a buildable lot and remain as such. Valve boxes
and main valves shall be operable and free from any defects. Under such
conditions, the line may be cut off at the property line. Lead lines shall not
be allowed for reuse or remain as stub-ins to a lot, but will be disconnected
on the main line.
3.Â Â Â Removal of Tees or Tapping-In Valves. Services that have been connected to
the water main by a tee or a tapping-in sleeve and valve will be removed from
the water main and replaced with a short length of pipe or repair sleeve. In
such cases the City will attempt to notify customers that may be affected at
that location. Plugging or capping a pipe may be acceptable but removal of the
valve will be required.
4.Â Â Â Corporation Stop Disconnection. When disconnecting at the corporation
stop, it will be allowable to turn the water off by moving it to the off
position. No leakage will be allowed around the fitting. Leakage through the
valve may be plugged using a copper disc. This work will require an inspection
and approval by the City.
90.28Â Â Â EXCAVATION FOR TAP.
The plumbing contractor shall be responsible for the excavation required for
the tapping of a water main. All trench work, excavation, and backfilling
required in making a connection shall be performed in accordance with the State

Anyone who shall operate or attempt to operate a fire hydrant without
permission of the City may be prosecuted as provided by law and lose his or her
status as a licensed plumber.
90.44Â Â Â RELOCATION OF PUBLIC FIRE HYDRANTS.
Where an existing public fire hydrant interferes with a property ownerâ€™s use or
proposed use of such personâ€™s property, the hydrant may be relocated only if
feasible and if relocation does not detract from the fire- fighting function at
the property ownerâ€™s expense. Where the grade of an existing street or property
is changed at the request of the property owner, such that an existing public
fire hydrant will not be at the proper elevation with respect to the ground,
the hydrant will be raised or lowered at the expense of the property owner.
Approval from the City must be obtained prior to any work being done.
90.45Â Â Â OBSTRUCTION OF HYDRANTS.
Nothing shall be erected or planted which shall interfere with the use of a
fire hydrant. Sufficient clearance shall be maintained around the hydrant to
permit easy connection of hoses and full circle operation of the hydrant using
regular hydrant wrenches and hose spanners. Shrubs, trees, flowers, or weeds
shall not be planted or permitted to grow so as to prevent full view of a fire
hydrant.
90.46Â Â Â PAINTING OF PUBLIC FIRE HYDRANTS.
Painting of fire hydrants will be done by the City. The following numbers will
indicate the flow capacity for the fire hydrant.
Â 
Hydrant Class Number Flow
Class A       1      1,000 gpm or greater
Class B       2      500 â€“ 999 gpm

business or industry is declared by resolution of the Council to be necessary
for the public health, safety, and welfare. Where there is no corresponding
period of the use the City Council shall give advance notice to the business or
industrial customer of the public hearing to determine the allowable use.
90.51Â Â Â WATER CONSERVATION PLAN VIOLATIONS.
Any person found to be using City water in violation of a declared water
conservation emergency shall be charged twice the rate which would otherwise
apply, as provided in
Chapter 92 of this Code of Ordinances, in addition any other sanctions
available to the City. This rate shall apply to all metered service through the
service connection used in the violation during any month that a water
conservation emergency is declared by the City Council to exist and during

Â 
91.01Â Â Â PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the conservation of water and
facilitate the equitable distribution of charges for water service among
customers.
91.02Â Â Â WATER USE METERED.
All water furnished customers shall be measured through meters furnished by the
City and installed by the City. All meters to be used for billing purposes
shall be supplied by the City and be owned by the City. The City reserves the
right to read, inspect, or test the meter at any reasonable time or with such
frequency as deemed necessary.
91.03Â Â Â GENERAL METER STANDARDS.
All water must be metered except water authorized by the City for the use by
other governmental units, for the purpose of firefighting, for street and sewer
flushing, for flushing or maintaining new and existing mains under the
supervision of the City, and for water usage for special purposes or
demonstrations when approved by the City. The following standards apply to the
various types of structures and developments within the City limits:
1.Â Â Â Single-Family Residences. Each single-family residence will have its own
meter. Mobile homes may be individually metered but maintenance will be the
responsibility of the park owner.
2.Â Â Â Mobile or Manufactured Home Parks.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The park owner shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Set all new meter installations for future homes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Report to the City the address and meter identification numbers
upon the installation of each new water meter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Relinquish ownership of all meters to the City upon installation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Notify the City upon any replacement or alterations to any metering
installation that may affect the billing or record keeping of the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Respond to any leaks or meter freeze-ups.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Replace any meter that is out of service for any reason. All frozen
or faulty meters must be returned to the City for testing for accuracy and for
billing of the customer for any damages.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Be responsible for all water shut-offs and turn-ons for any reason.
All skirting, insulation, heat tape, ice block and other insulation equipment
will be removed by owner of the home or by the park manager or owner of the
park.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â City Responsibility. The City shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Maintain ownership of all water meters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Read all meters monthly including the master meter on the same day.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Notify mobile home park owners of any stopped meters so
replacements can be made.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Test metersâ€™ accuracy on any meter removed from service prior to it
being returned to service.
3.Â Â Â Apartments, Duplexes, and Condominiums. Each building must have at least
one individual meter that does not take water from another metered line or
building. Master metering of more than one building in a complex is an option
when approved by the City. If the premises to be served are multiple and one
meter is to serve more than one tenant, it will be necessary for the owner of
the premises or their authorized agent to apply for the meter. Each water meter
will have its own meter control valve. Existing meters without a control valve
will be modified to conform with these rules and regulations when work is
performed on said system. Meters serving multi-units will be centrally located.
4.Â Â Â Multi-Unit Developments. When units are served by a private water system
there shall be a master meter ahead of any individual unit meters. Said usage
registered on the unit meters shall be compared periodically to the master
meter. This shall be done periodically. Any difference between the master meter
and the individual unit meters shall be the responsibility of the management of
the development to pay. If individual meters are installed, sources of water
usage will be metered.
5.Â Â Â Shopping Centers and Commercial Downtown Businesses. Each business will be
required to have its own meter. Design of system must be approved by the City.
Additional meters may be purchased and installed by the owner for tenants in
the same building. Each meter installed shall have its own meter control valve
and shall be centrally located with other meters.
6.Â Â Â Industrial Complexes. Plants or industrial complexes shall be master
metered providing the buildings are all required for a central operation and
are not separated by a public thoroughfare.
7.Â Â Â Institutions. Educational facilities, public housing complexes, and other
institutions with a number of buildings may be master metered if they are not
separated by a public thoroughfare. Master metering of such complexes must be
requested in writing and approved by the City.
8.Â Â Â Construction Sites. Water may be used for building or other construction
purposes only after application has been made to the City for a temporary
construction meter and all proper fees paid.
91.04Â Â Â TYPE AND SIZE OF METERS.
The type and make of meter used will be specified by the City. Meter sizing
shall be based on flow requirements only and not on pressure loss through the
meter. Information shall be supplied by the prospective user or his agent
before a meter can be sized. Meters, five-eighths inch through one and one-half
inch, will be sized by the City based on the recommended application listed
below.
Â 
METER SIZE            RECOMMENDED APPLICATIONS
Five-Eighths Inch     Demand flow rates one quarter to 25 gpm
                      Maximum continuous demand 10 gpm

Water meters shall be equipped with shut-off valves at each end. Not more than
one shut off will be allowed between where the service enters the building and
the meter. A multi meter set may have a master shut off valve. Each meter shall
have its own meter valves on both sides within 12 inches from the meter
(Figures 1-3).
91.10Â Â Â METER COSTS.
The full cost of any meter larger than that required for a single- family
residence shall be paid to the City by the property owner or customer prior to
the installation of any such meter by the City, or, at the sole option of the
City, the property owner or customer may be required to purchase and install
such meter in accordance with requirements established by the City.
91.11Â Â Â RIGHT OF ENTRY.
The Superintendent shall be permitted to enter the premises of any customer at
any reasonable time to read, remove, test, or change a meter.
91.12Â Â Â METER TESTING.
The Superintendent or any designee shall make a test of the accuracy of any
water meter at any time when requested in writing. If it is found that such
meter overruns to the extent of five percent or more, the cost of the test
shall be paid by the City and a refund shall be made to the customer for
overcharges collected since the last known date of accuracy, but not more than
five percent of the total water bill and not for a longer period than three
months. If the meter is found to be accurate or slow or less than five percent
fast, the user shall pay a testing charge of $35.00.
91.13Â Â Â ACCURACY TEST.
The Superintendent shall make a test of the accuracy of any water meter at any
time when requested in writing, but not more often than once in six months.

more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the Cityâ€™s
wastewater treatment facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Is subject to National Pretreatment Standards under Title 40 of the
Code of Federal Regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Is designated by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources as a
significant industrial user on the basis that the contributing industry, either
singly, or in combination with other contributing industries, has a reasonable
potential for adversely affecting the operation of, or effluent quality from,
the Cityâ€™s wastewater treatment facility or for violating any pretreatment
standards or requirements.
2.Â Â Â Residential outside water meters will be charged a flat volumetric rate
equal to the 1,501 + CF volume tier.
3.Â Â Â Each individual residential and commercial unit being supplied City water,
including each individual home within a mobile home park, shall be assessed, on
a monthly basis, a base rate for water usage, whether separately metered or
not. For example, each occupied unit of a four-plex being provided City water
shall be assessed for a base rate each month. The usage rate, however, shall be
assessed per meter, not per unit served. Units within a complex, whether
residential, commercial, or mobile home park, separately metered for water
usage shall be separately billed for both base and usage rates and the amount
of water used by those units within the complex shall be subtracted from the
amount of water shown as being used by the master meter for the complex for
purposes of billing usage to the owner of the complex. Returning to the four-
plex example, if all four units were occupied and being provided City water
through one meter, the party owning the property would be billed for four
monthly base rates, and the usage rate would be assessed against that party for
all water used in excess of 960 cubic feet of water per month, i.e., the usage
in excess of the water provided each of the four occupied units with their
monthly base rate charges. If one of the four-plex units were separately
metered, that unit would be billed separately for not only its base rate, but
for its usage as well, and the amount of water it used would be subtracted from
the master meter reading to determine the usage to be billed the owner of the
complex and that party would be billed for that usage, as well as for three
base rates.
92.03Â Â Â RATES OUTSIDE THE CITY.
Water service shall be provided to any customer located outside the corporate
limits of the City which the City has agreed to serve at rates 200 percent of
the rates provided in this section. No such customer, however, will be served
unless the customer shall have signed a service contract agreeing to be bound
by the ordinances, rules, and regulations applying to water service established
by the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.4 and 384.84)
92.04Â Â Â BULK WATER RATES.

recorded and submitted to the City or its agent for the purpose of billing the
water recipient at current bulk rates.
92.05Â Â Â CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.
There shall be required from every new water and sewer customer not the owner
of the premises served a $100.00 deposit intended to guarantee the payment of
bills for service. One-half of the required security deposit shall be paid
before water and sewer service is provided, but the customer may elect to pay
the balance of the security deposit over a two-month period, being assessed
$25.00 each month. The customerâ€™s security deposit shall be held in its
entirety until the customerâ€™s account is closed.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
92.06Â Â Â METER READING FOR BILLING.
Meters will be read monthly. If weather creates unsafe conditions or human life
is in danger by an animal, the City will estimate that monthâ€™s water usage. All
customers shall make it possible for the City to obtain readings of any water
meters attached to the water service serving the premises. The water service
may be discontinued if the City or its agent is not allowed to read the meters.
92.07Â Â Â BILLING FOR WATER SERVICE.
Only the parties requesting water and sewer service and posting security
deposit pursuant to Section
92.05 shall be responsible for payment of all bills submitted by or on behalf
of the City for water and sewer service provided them. Water service shall be
billed as part of a combined service account, payable in accordance with the
following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
1.Â Â Â Bills Issued. The Clerk shall prepare and issue bills for combined service
accounts on or before the fifteenth day of each month. Those bills shall be
mailed by ordinary U.S. mail to the responsible parties within, as nearly as
practical, 48 hours of the meter reading. All water bills will be mailed
monthly and shall be due and payable on or before the due date. Payment may be
made by mail or at City Hall, 107 S. Ford, Anamosa, IA, or at other designated
pay stations. A list of the pay stations and addresses is available.
2.Â Â Â Bills Payable. Bills for combined service accounts shall be due and
payable at the office of the Clerk by the first Monday of the following month.
Reminders for all bills not paid by the due date will be issued the day after
the due date (on the first Tuesday of each month).
3.Â Â Â Late Payment Penalty. Bills not paid when due shall be considered
delinquent. A one-time late payment penalty of five percent of the amount due
shall be added to each delinquent bill.
4.Â Â Â Right To Protest. Any person having any cause to question or contest a
water and sewer bill may file a protest in writing with the Clerk within the

the partyâ€™s challenge. Upon receipt of such a protest the Clerk shall suspend
collection efforts with regard to the bill and shall schedule a time for the
aggrieved party to address the Council at its next regular meeting.
92.08Â Â Â SERVICE DISCONTINUED.
Water service to delinquent customers shall be discontinued or disconnected in
accordance with the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)

be discontinued or disconnected if payment of the combined service account,
including late payment charges, is not received by the date specified in the
notice of delinquency. Such notice shall be sent by ordinary mail to the
customer in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred and shall inform
the customer of the nature of the delinquency and afford the customer the
opportunity for a hearing prior to the discontinuance or disconnection.
2.Â Â Â Notice to Landlords. If the customer is a tenant, and if the owner or
landlord of the property or premises has made a written request for notice, the
notice of delinquency shall also be given to the owner or landlord. If the
customer is a tenant and requests a change of name for service under the
account, such request shall be sent to the owner or landlord of the property if
the owner or landlord has made a written request for notice of any change of
name for service under the account to the rental property.
3.Â Â Â Hearing. If a hearing is requested by noon of the day preceding the shut
off, the City Administrator shall conduct an informal hearing and shall make a
determination as to whether the discontinuance or disconnection is justified.
The customer has the right to appeal the City Administratorâ€™s decision to the
Council, and if the Council finds that discontinuance or disconnection is
justified, then such discontinuance or disconnection shall be made, unless
payment has been received.
4.Â Â Â Fees. Each delinquent customer shall be assessed a fee of $30.00 each time
City water service is disconnected, and an additional fee of $30.00 shall be
assessed each time City water service is reconnected. Such disconnection or
reconnection fees assessed under this subsection may be waived by the City when
the service is required for the purpose of repairing a water line. No fee shall
be charged for the usual or customary trips in the regular changes in
occupancies of property.
92.09Â Â Â TURN OFF AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES.

customerâ€™s premises, branched off another service line or requires the meter or
the meter stop valve to be locked out, the City shall have the right to enter
upon private premises to inspect or shut off water to any premises. Any
interference with a service line that has been locked out shall be deemed a
violation of this Code of Ordinances. A disconnect notice will be generated for
each customer. The day following the due date on the disconnection notice the
City will disconnect service to any customer who has not paid the past due
amount or has not made payment arrangements. If the customer is shut off for
nonpayment, there will be a disconnection and reconnection fees, as specified
in Subsection
92.08(4), in order to restore services to the customer during regular working
hours. After hours reconnection fees will be at a rate of two times the regular
reconnect fee. The City or agent will collect all fees prior to reconnecting
any water supply.
92.10Â Â Â LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
The owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall be
jointly and severally liable for water service charges to the premises. Water
service charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien upon
the property or premises served and shall be certified by the Clerk to the
County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.

building sewer shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of the
State Plumbing Code and the provisions of Section
90.28 and
Chapter 135 of this Code of Ordinances. No backfill shall be placed until the
work has been inspected by the City.
96.05Â Â Â CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
1.Â Â Â Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
2.Â Â Â Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer shall
be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands at
the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or
driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may be
extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
3.Â Â Â Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to the
public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code and
applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
4.Â Â Â Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
5.Â Â Â Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
6.Â Â Â Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight line
to meet the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Recommended grade at one-fourth inch per foot.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum grade of one-eighth inch per foot.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum velocity of two feet per second with the sewer half full.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only with the written
approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with approved fittings.
7.Â Â Â Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
8.Â Â Â Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building
sewer.
9.Â Â Â Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws, splits,
or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code except
that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public sewer, shall
comply with the current edition of one of the following:

compatible with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
12.Â Â Â Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
13.Â Â Â Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any residence,
business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06Â Â Â INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Grease, oil, sludge, and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and service
stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand, or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required,
such interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
1.Â Â Â Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity as
specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent, and
shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.

impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
3.Â Â Â Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at the
ownerâ€™s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at all
times.
96.07Â Â Â SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the â€œYâ€
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located â€œYâ€ branch is available, a saddle â€œYâ€ shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendentâ€™s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08Â Â Â INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09Â Â Â PROPERTY OWNERâ€™S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
96.10Â Â Â ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines, whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the ownerâ€™s expense, within 30 days after date of
official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time, the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration, or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
13.Â Â Â Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are not
amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed,
or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment
plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05Â Â Â RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the City Council may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
City Council may:
1.Â Â Â Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
2.Â Â Â Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
3.Â Â Â Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
4.Â Â Â Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06Â Â Â SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the City Council permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the City Council and subject to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary treatment or flow-
equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the ownerâ€™s expense.
97.07Â Â Â CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the City Council, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City Council.
The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâ€™s expense, and shall
be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
97.08Â Â Â TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)
97.09Â Â Â REPLACEMENT OF CONFORMING CITY SEWER MAIN.
It will be the responsibility of the City to replace and repair any City sewer
main that is in the City right-of- way and is the property of the City. If a
City sewer main needs to be replaced, the City will replace that main with one
that has a diameter of at least eight inches. It will be the responsibility of
the City to connect all building sewer lines that were previously connected to
the main that has been replaced.
97.10Â Â Â REPLACING EXISTING CITY-OWNED NONCONFORMING CITY SEWER MAIN WITH
CONFORMING CITY SEWER MAIN.
When an agent designated by the City determines that a City-owned nonconforming
sewer main has to be replaced with a conforming City sewer main, the expense of
the conforming sewer main will be the responsibility of the City. It will be
the responsibility of the property owner to connect the ownerâ€™s building sewer
line to the new City sewer main. Property owners are required to connect to the
new sewer line within one year. If the property owner does not connect to the
City sewer main, when the main is installed, the property owner will be
required to make an application to the City and pay the associated fees. The
City sewer main and the building lines must be inspected and approved by an
agent designated by the City before any backfill can take place. The City sewer
main will remain the property and responsibility of the City.
97.11Â Â Â EXTENSION OF THE CITY SEWER MAIN IN PREVIOUSLY PLATTED AND RECORDED
SECTIONS OR DEVELOPED AREAS WITHIN THE CORPORATE CITY LIMITS.
The City may refuse service to persons not presently customers when, in the
opinion of the City Council, the capacity of the municipal sewer system will
not permit such service. The City may construct or authorize construction of
extensions to its sewer lines within its service area, but the City shall not
be required to make such extensions.
1.Â Â Â Extension of a Conforming City Sewer Main. In the event that a property
owner requests that the City sewer main be extended to make service to said
ownerâ€™s property available, all costs of the sewer extension shall be the
responsibility of the party requesting service. The City may reimburse the
customer for the additional cost of materials, including manholes and/or
cleanouts, to upgrade from a standard four- inch building sewer to a conforming
City sewer main. All of the criteria of the City sewer line must be met and the
costs of installing and connecting the building sewer will be the
responsibility of the property owner requesting service. All sewer line
extensions shall be evidenced by a contract signed by the City and the customer
for such extension. Such contracts shall be approved by the City Council. When
the application for main extension has been filed, and the contract approved,
the City will accept the responsibility of hiring a contractor and supervising
the installation. The City sewer main and the building line must be inspected
and approved by an agent designated by the City before any backfill can take
place. Once the City sewer main has been inspected and approved, the City sewer
main will become the property and responsibility of the City. The person
requesting service will be responsible for the application for permit fee. If a
City sewer main extension passes by other properties, each property or lot will
be required to have a sewer tap and a stub extending to their property line.
Each sewer tap will have a connection fee as set by resolution of the City
Council and the property owner will be responsible for the cost of extending
the service on such ownerâ€™s property line.
2.Â Â Â Extension of a City Sewer Main Into Private Property. In the event that a
property owner requests that a City sewer main be extended into property that
is currently privately owned, all costs of the installation, materials,
engineering, and manholes will be the responsibility of the property owner. The
property owner will provide to the City a public easement through all of the
properties involved. All costs of installing and connecting the building sewer
line will be the responsibility of the property owner. All City sewer main
extensions shall be evidenced by a contract signed by the City and the customer
for such extension. Such contracts shall be approved by the City Council. When
the application for main extension has been filed, and the contract approved,
the City will accept the responsibility of hiring a contractor and supervising
the installation. The City sewer main and the building sewer line must be
inspected and approved by an agent appointed by the City before any backfill
can take place. After the City sewer main has been inspected and approved, the
City may elect to take over the main and accept ownership and responsibility of
the main. The customer will be responsible for the application and for the
permit fee.
If there is any type of an Agreement between City and the party interested in
having service extended, such terms of the Agreement shall take precedence over
any section in conflict with the Agreement.

Â 
1.Â Â Â In lieu of a base rate, industrial users shall pay two cents per cubic
foot for wastewater discharge in excess of the volume of water used by the
industrial user, regardless of source.
2.Â Â Â By changing the base rate and volumetric rate charged sewer service
customers located outside the corporate City limits under
3.Â Â Â For use in this chapter, unless the context specifically indicates
otherwise, the following terms are defined:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Residential: A meter that measures water being provided to an area
where residential activities are the primary activities. Apartment buildings
and assisted living facilities that typically provide for long term residence
will be considered residential.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Commercial: A meter that measures water to an area being provided where
commercial activities are the primary activities. Hospitals, nursing homes, and
hotels that provide temporary residential services will be considered
commercial.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Industrial: If a user meets the following criteria regarding its
wastewater discharge, it will be considered an industrial user for both water
and wastewater utilities, regardless of how the other user classifications may
apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Discharges an average of 25,000 gallons per day or more of
processed wastewater;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Contributes a process waste stream which makes up five percent or
more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the Cityâ€™s
wastewater treatment facility;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Is subject to National Pretreatment Standards under Title 40 of the
Code of Federal Regulations; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Is designated by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources as a
significant industrial user on the basis that the contributing industry, either
singly or in combination with other contributing industries, has a reasonable
potential for adversely affecting the operation of or effluent quality from the
Cityâ€™s wastewater treatment facility or for violating any pretreatment
standards or requirements.
4.Â Â Â Each individual residential and commercial unit being supplied City
sewer,including each individual home within a mobile home park, shall be
assessed, on a monthly basis, a base rate for sewer rental, whether separately
metered for water or not. For example, each occupied unit of a four-plex being
serviced with City sewer shall be assessed for a base rate each month. The
usage rate, however, shall be assessed per meter, not per unit served. Units
within a complex, whether residential, commercial, or mobile home park that has
a master meter and then each unit is separately metered for water usage shall
be separately billed for both base and usage rates and the amount of water used
by those units within the complex shall be subtracted from the amount of water
shown as being used by the master meter for the complex for purposes of billing
usage to the owner of the complex. Returning to the four-plex example, if all
four units were occupied and being provided City water through one meter, the
party owning the property would be billed for sewer service at the rate of four
monthly base rates, and the usage rate would be assessed against that party for
all water used in excess of 960 cubic feet (CF) of water per month, i.e., the
usage in excess of the cubic feet provided to each of the four occupied units
with their monthly base rate charges (i.e., 4 x 240 CF = 960 CF). If one of the
four-plex units were separately metered, that unit would be billed separately
for not only its base rate, but for its usage as well, and the amount of water
it used would be subtracted from the master meter reading to determine the
usage to be billed the owner of the complex and that party would be billed for
that usage, as well as for three base rates.
5.Â Â Â When some or all of the water used by a contributor does not pass into a
sanitary utility or when some or all of the water used by a contributor does
not pass through the City water meter, then the amount of water or waste
discharged into the sanitary utilities shall be determined by the City in such
equitable manner as it may elect, provided, however, the contributor may
install and maintain a meter acceptable to the City for this purpose.
6.Â Â Â In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitable adjusted
to the service rendered, the City shall have the right to base its charges not
only on volume but also on the strength and character of the sewage and wastes
deposited by the contributor. The City shall have the right to measure and
determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged either
directly or indirectly into the sanitary utilities, in such manner and by such
methods as it may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and
circumstances of the case in order to determine the proper charge. Extra
charges based on strength of the sewage and liquid wastes shall be made on the
following basis:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For suspended solids in excess of two and one-half pounds for each 100
cubic feet of sewage and waste, an additional charge of one cent shall be made
for each pound.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The determination of suspended solids in the waste shall be in
accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage.
99.03Â Â Â SEWER RATES OUTSIDE THE CITY.
The base rate and usage rate for sewer service customers located outside the
corporate City limits shall be 200 percent of the base and volumetric rates
charged sewer service customers within the Cityâ€™s corporate limits.
99.04Â Â Â SPECIAL SEWER RATES.
Where, in the judgment of the Superintendent and the Council, special
conditions exist to the extent that the application of the sewer charges
provided in Section
99.02 would be inequitable or unfair to either the City or the customer, a
special rate shall be proposed by the Superintendent and submitted to the
Council for approval by resolution.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.05Â Â Â CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.
[See Section
92.05 of this Code of Ordinances]
99.06Â Â Â DISPOSAL OF WASTE FROM CESSPOOLS, SEPTIC TANKS OR PRIVY VAULTS.
Any contributor engaged in cleaning cesspools, septic tanks or privy vaults
shall discharge all effluent into a designated location at the sewage treatment
plant. The rate for receiving such waste shall be determined by the City. It
shall be unlawful for any contributor to place any effluent or waste from
cesspools, septic tanks, or privy vaults in any other location in the City
except at the designated location at the sewage treatment plant.
99.07Â Â Â PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS.
Customers whose premises are served by a private water system shall pay sewer
charges based upon the water used as determined by the City either by an
estimate agreed to by the customer or by metering the water system at the
customerâ€™s expense. Any negotiated or agreed-upon sales or charges shall be
subject to approval of the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.08Â Â Â PAYMENT OF BILLS.
All sewer service charges are due and payable under the same terms and
conditions provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in
Section
92.07 of this Code of Ordinances. Sewer service may be discontinued or
disconnected in accordance with the provisions contained in Section
92.08 if the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions
contained in Section
92.12 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent
account.
99.09Â Â Â LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
Except as provided for in Section
92.11 of this Code of Ordinances, the owner of the premises served, and any
lessee or tenant thereof, shall be jointly and severally liable for sewer
service charges to the premises. Sewer service charges remaining unpaid and
delinquent shall constitute a lien upon the property or premises served and
shall be certified by the Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the
same manner as property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.10Â Â Â SEWER USER FEE ADJUSTMENTS.
The Mayor and City Administrator may grant a one-time adjustment to sewer user
fees for water leaks that have resulted in unusually high sewer user fees,
provided that the adjustment meets the following criteria:
1.Â Â Â The amount of the adjustment shall equal the sum of the sewer bill that
exceeds the average monthly sewer fee for the most recent three-month period,
up to a maximum adjustment of $500.00.
2.Â Â Â The customer can demonstrate the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The excessive sewer fee was the result of a leak in the plumbing system
on their property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The leak has been completely repaired.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The leak was not caused by the ownerâ€™s negligence.
3.Â Â Â The adjustment is limited to the sewer user fee bill for only one month.
4.Â Â Â The business or customer and spouse have not been granted any previous
adjustment on either a residence account or business account during their
lifetime as a customer of the City.
5.Â Â Â This policy shall not apply to charges for water services.
99.11Â Â Â SEWER DISCOUNT FOR WATER NOT ENTERING THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
The City shall charge a fee of $150.00 for the purchase of an additional water
meter for the purpose of measuring water that does not enter the Cityâ€™s
sanitary sewer system. The property owner shall be responsible for the proper
installation and maintenance of the meter in compliance with the Cityâ€™s
standard specifications and Chapters
90 and
91 of this Code of Ordinances. After the installation, the meter shall be
inspected by the Public Works Department to verify that the water measured by
the additional meter cannot enter the Cityâ€™s sanitary sewer system. The
property owner shall pay the current usage rate for water that is consumed and
measured by the additional meter during any month when water is consumed
through the additional meter. The property owner shall not be required to pay
the sewer user base rate or sewer usage charge for the water consumed and
measured by the additional meter. It shall be the property ownerâ€™s
responsibility to advise the City when the additional meter is not in use and
that water to the additional meter has been shut off. If it is the observation
of the City Administrator and the Superintendent that the water measured by
this separate meter has been discharged into the Cityâ€™s sanitary sewer system
or the water is actually used by another person or entity, then the City may
remove the meter or deny the written request. The decision of the City
Administrator may be appealed in writing to the City Council.
99.12Â Â Â SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.
No statement in these chapters shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement, or contract between the Council, and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rate, and cost as established by the
Council.
CHAPTER 100
PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS
Â 
100.01 Pretreatment 100.02 Wastewater Discharge Permits
Â 
100.01Â Â Â PRETREATMENT.
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
these Sanitary Sewer chapters and shall achieve compliance with all federal
categorical pretreatment standards and schedules where applicable. Any non-
domestic user of the wastewater system may be required to have a pretreatment
agreement and will be required to achieve certain pollutant discharge limits.
If pretreatment is necessary to achieve these limits the facility constructed
or installed to meet the limits shall be provided, operated, and maintained at
the user or ownerâ€™s expense.
100.02Â Â Â WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater pretreatment
agreement shall be deemed a violation of this Code of Ordinances and subjects
the non-domestic user to extra sewer charges and sanctions described in the
agreement. Obtaining a pretreatment agreement does not relieve a user of its
obligation to comply with all federal, State, or local laws. The wastewater
pretreatment agreement may require:
1.Â Â Â Pretreatment of industrial wastewaters prior to discharge to the
wastewater system.
2.Â Â Â Flow equalization to reduce peak flows.
3.Â Â Â Discharge of certain wastes only to specific sewers.
4.Â Â Â Relocation of discharge points.
5.Â Â Â Prohibition of certain discharges.
6.Â Â Â Restriction of some discharges to specific hours of the day.
7.Â Â Â Payment of charges to defray costs that may be related to specific
discharges.
8.Â Â Â Extra charges for discharges over limits.
9.Â Â Â Other conditions that may be needed to implement activities consistent
with the intent of these Sanitary Sewer chapters.
No person shall discharge wastewater to the wastewater system in excess of the
quantity or quality limits established in the wastewater pretreatment
agreement. A schedule for complying with agreement requirements, effluent
limits, self-monitoring requirements, or other requirements deemed necessary by
the Superintendent shall be submitted to the City for approval by the non-
domestic user in a time frame established by the City. The City may require
compliance schedule progress reports, a report on final compliance with
effluent limits and standards, and periodic reports on continued compliance.
The City may require a non- domestic user to submit to compliance independent
of a compliance schedule.

material being transported spills upon any public right-of-way.
106.10Â Â Â REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE.
Should the Council find, on its own motion or upon application of the City
Administrator, that any licensed waste collector is in violation of the terms
of this chapter, or the laws of the State, or regulations of the Department of
Natural Resources with regard to the collection, transportation or disposition
of any solid waste or yard waste, the City may by resolution suspend or revoke
the license of the waste collector. If suspension of the waste collectorâ€™s
license is deemed appropriate, the City shall specify the period of suspension
and identify the corrective measures to be undertaken by the waste collector
during the period of suspension to enable the waste collector to regain the
license. Whether the sanction is suspension or revocation of the license, the
resolution adopting the sanction shall set forth the reasons for the sanction,
and a certified copy of the resolution shall be sent to the waste collector,
who shall then have seven days within which to file a written request with the
Clerk for the opportunity to be heard by the Council with respect to the

the suspension or revocation of the license until the waste collector has been
afforded the opportunity to be heard on the matter, which hearing shall be held

the hearing. Following hearing, the Council may affirm, revoke, or modify the
sanction previously proposed as the circumstances of the case warrant.
106.11Â Â Â SOLID WASTE ASSESSMENT FEE.
In order to collect sufficient revenues to pay the Cityâ€™s annual assessment for
the operation of the Jones County Sanitary Landfill and the cost of yard waste
disposal, the Clerk shall assess and collect a monthly fee of $2.00 from each
resident, dwelling unit, commercial or professional business, and industry
within the City. The assessment shall be billed to each responsible party with
the monthly water and sewer (combined services) assessment. If the assessment
fee is not timely paid by the owner or responsible party, it shall constitute a
lien upon the property or premises served and shall be certified by the Clerk
to the County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.
The aforementioned solid waste assessment fee is separate from, and in addition
to, any collection fees assessed by licensed waste collectors for the service
of the collection, transport, processing, or disposition of solid waste within
the City.

entitled to a hearing before the Council concerning the alleged violation if
the alleged violator files a written request therefor with the Clerk within
seven days after being given the notice by the City Administrator. Within 30
days after the filing of a request for hearing by the alleged violator, the
Council shall hold the hearing and, by resolution, either affirm, modify, or
revoke the City Administratorâ€™s proposed action. The Clerk shall promptly give
notice to the alleged violator of the Councilâ€™s action in the form of a
certified copy of the resolution. The alleged violator shall comply with the
provisions of the City Administratorâ€™s order as affirmed or modified by
resolution of the Council.
106.14Â Â Â METHOD OF GIVING NOTICE.
Any notice or demand required or permitted by this chapter shall be sufficient

immunities now provided for, or as hereafter amended, and applicable to the
operations of a public utility, by State or federal law. The rates to be

2.Â Â Â If an energy supplier is unable to furnish an adequate supply of energy
due to an emergency, an order or decision of a public regulatory body, or other
acts beyond the control of the Grantee, then the Grantee shall have the right
and authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations limiting, curtailing or
allocating extensions of service or supply of energy to any customers or
prospective customers, and withholding the supply of energy to new customers,
provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each

Notes
  â€ Â EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Ordinance No. 723, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
â€City, was passed and adopted on August 23, 2004. The Grantee accepted the
  franchise ordinance on September 23, 2004.
  Â 
110.04Â Â Â CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
1.Â Â Â Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up and any and all excavations
made shall be done in such a manner as to cause only such inconvenience to the
inhabitants of Grantor and to the general public as is reasonably necessary;
and repairs and replacements shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable by
Grantee, leaving such properties in as good a condition as existed immediately
prior to excavation.
2.Â Â Â Grantee agrees that for the term of this grant, it will use its best
efforts to maintain facilities and equipment sufficient to meet the current and
future energy requirements of Grantor, its inhabitants, and industries. While
maintaining its facilities and equipment, Grantee shall obtain permits as
required by ordinance, except that in emergency situations, Grantee shall take
immediate unilateral actions as it determines are necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare; in which case, Grantee shall notify Grantor
as soon as reasonably possible.
3.Â Â Â Grantor will give Grantee reasonable notice of plans for street
improvements where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved that
affect Grantee's facilities. The notice shall contain the nature and character
of the improvements, the rights-of-way upon which the improvements are to be
made, the extent of the improvements and the time when the Grantor will start
the work, and, if more than one right-of-way is involved, the order in which
this work is to proceed. The notice shall be given to the Grantee a sufficient
length of time, considering seasonable working conditions, in advance of the
actual commencement of the work to permit the Grantee to make any additions,
alterations, or repairs to its facilities.
110.05Â Â Â EXTENSION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
Upon receipt and acceptance of a valid application for service, Grantee shall,
subject to its own economic feasibility criteria under its Iowa tariff, and in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board, make

within the current or future corporate limits of Grantor.
110.06Â Â Â RELOCATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.

avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or public place for a public purpose,
Grantee, upon reasonable notice from Grantor, shall remove and relocate its
facilities or equipment situated in the public rights-of-way, if such removal
is necessary for completion of the project, at the cost and expense of Grantee.
If Grantor orders or requests Grantee to relocate its facilities or equipment
for the primary benefit of a commercial or private project, or as a result of
the initial request of a commercial or private developer or other non-public
entity, and such removal is necessary to complete the project, Grantee shall
receive payment for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocating
its facilities or equipment. Grantor shall consider reasonable alternatives in
designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause Grantee
unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under this section.
Grantor shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for Grantee's
facilities. Grantor shall give Grantee written notice of vacating of a public
right-of-way. Vacating of a public right-of-way shall not deprive the Grantee
of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities, until the reasonable
cost of relocating the same are first paid to the Grantee, unless an easement
for the existing facilities is reserved for the benefit of Grantee by Grantor.
Any person or corporation desiring to move a building or other structure along,
or to make any unusual use of any street, alley, avenue, bridge, public right-
of-way, or public place which shall interfere with the facilities or equipment
of the Grantee, shall first give notice to the Grantor and the Grantee, and pay
a sum sufficient to cover the expense and damage incident to the moving of
Grantee's facilities and equipment.

its customers located within the corporate limits of the Grantor, and pay to
the Grantor, an amount equal to an amount not greater than two percent of gross

delivered within the present or future limits of the Grantor as may be
specified by resolution of the City Council. Gross receipts as used herein are
revenues received from the sale, distribution, or transportation of natural
gas, after deducting refunds issued for correction of bills theretofore
rendered.

exempt from, all other taxes which the Grantor may impose for the rights and
privileges herein granted or for the privilege of doing business within the
City including, but not limited to, local sales and services tax and local
school infrastructure excise tax, and in the event any such fee, charge,
license, tax or assessment shall be imposed by the Grantor, the payment to be
made in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be reduced in an
amount equal to the annual burden of such fee, charge, license, tax or
assessment imposed upon the Grantee. Ad valorem property taxes imposed
generally upon all real and personal property within the Grantor shall not be
deemed to affect the obligation of the Grantee under this section.
3.Â Â Â Any consideration hereunder shall be reported and paid to the Grantor by
Grantee on a monthly basis. Such payment shall be made within 30 days following
the close of the period for which payment is due. Initial and final payments
shall be prorated for the portion of the period at the beginning and end of the
term of the ordinance codified by this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Grantee shall list the local franchise fee collected from customers as a
separate item on bills for utility service issued to customers. If at any time
the Iowa Utilities Board, or other authority having proper jurisdiction,
prohibits such recovery, then Grantee will no longer be obligated to collect
and pay the franchise fee herein contemplated.
5.Â Â Â The Grantor shall provide copies of annexation ordinances and resolutions
changing the franchise fee to Grantee on a timely basis to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
Grantor.
6.Â Â Â The Grantor shall have access to and the right to examine during normal
business hours, those of Granteeâ€™s books, receipts, files, records, and
documents that are necessary to verify the correctness of payments due
hereunder. If it is determined that a mistake was made in the payment of any
franchise fee required hereunder, such mistake shall be corrected promptly upon
discovery, such that any under-payment by Grantee shall be paid within 30 days
of the recalculation and any over-payment by Grantee shall be discounted from
the next payment(s) due.
110.08Â Â Â CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Grantor acknowledges that certain information it might request pursuant to this
franchise may be of a proprietary and confidential nature. If Grantee requests
that any information provided by Grantee to Grantor be kept confidential due to
such proprietary or commercial value, Grantor and its employees, agents, and
representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of that information, to the
extent allowed by law. If Grantor is requested or required by legal or
administrative process to disclose any such confidential information, Grantor
shall promptly notify Grantee of such request or requirement so that Grantee
may seek an appropriate protective order or other relief. Grantor shall use all
reasonable efforts to ensure that the confidentiality of Grantee's confidential
information is maintained.
110.09Â Â Â FORCE MAJEURE.
It shall not be a breach or default under this franchise if either party fails
to perform its obligations hereunder due to Force Majeure. Force Majeure shall
include, but not be limited to, the following: (i) physical events such as acts
of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, freezing, storms, floods,
washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to

such as strikes, work-force stoppages, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars;
(iii) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court
order, law, statute, ordinance, executive order, or regulation promulgated by a
governmental authority having jurisdiction; and any other causes, whether of
the kind herein enumerated or otherwise not reasonably within the control of
the affected party to prevent or overcome. Each party shall make reasonable
efforts to avoid Force Majeure and to resolve such event as promptly as
reasonably possible once it occurs in order to resume performance; provided,
however, that this provision shall not obligate a party to settle any labor
strike.
110.10Â Â Â HOLD HARMLESS.
Grantee, during the term of this franchise, agrees to save harmless Grantor
from and against all claims, demands, losses and expenses arising directly out
of the negligence of Grantee, its employees or agents, in the constructing,
operating, and maintaining of distribution and transmission facilities or
appliances of Grantee; provided, however, that Grantee need not save harmless
Grantor from claims, demands, losses and expenses arising out of the negligence
of Grantor, its employees or agents.
110.11Â Â Â NON-WAIVER.
Any waiver of any obligation or default under this franchise shall not be
construed as a waiver of any future defaults, whether of like or different
character.
110.12Â Â Â REPEAL CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
This franchise ordinance, when accepted by Grantee, shall constitute the entire
agreement between the Grantor and the Grantee â€   relating to this franchise and
the same shall supersede all prior ordinances pertaining to this franchise
agreement, and any terms and conditions of such prior ordinances or parts of

Â 
Notes
  â€ Â EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Ordinance No. 814 adopting an electric franchise for the
â€City, was passed and adopted on November 26, 2007.
  Â 
111.02Â Â Â PLACEMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT.
The poles, wires and appliances shall be placed and maintained so as not to
unnecessarily interfere with the travel on said streets, alleys, and public
places in said City or unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of the same,
including ordinary drainage, or with the sewers, underground pipe and other
property of the City, and the Company, its successors and assigns shall hold
the City free and harmless from all damages arising from the negligent acts or
omissions of the Company in the erection or maintenance of said system.
111.03Â Â Â INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall defend, indemnify, and hold the City harmless at all times
during the term of this franchise from and against all claims for injury or
damage to persons or property caused by the construction, erection, operation
or maintenance of its properties, or the negligence of its contractors or its
employees. In case of any suit or action at law being commenced against the
City, upon any claim for damage arising out of any loss, injury or damage,
claimed to have been caused by any installation, improvement, obstruction, or
excavation in any street, alley, sidewalk or public place in the City, and
which installation, improvement, obstruction, or excavation was made or left
in, under or upon a such street, sidewalk, alley, or public place by said
Company, its agents, contractors, or employees, upon being notified in writing
by the City of such action or proceeding, the Company shall appear and make
proper defense thereto; and if any final and unappealable judgment is rendered
against the City therein, the Company hereby agrees to assume, pay, and satisfy
such judgment or decree, with the costs thereof.
111.04Â Â Â EXCAVATIONS.
In making any excavations in any street, alley, avenue, or public place,
Company, its successors, and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in
progress by guards, barriers, or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the
use of the streets, shall back fill all openings in such manner as to prevent
settling or depressions in surface, pavement, or sidewalk of such excavations
with same materials, restoring the condition as nearly as practical and if
defects are caused shall repair the same.
111.05Â Â Â NOTICE OF EXCAVATION.
Company shall provide reasonable advance notice to City before excavating in
streets or public grounds of the City. Such notice shall state a particular
part or point of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length
of time in which such work will take to be done. In cases where emergency work
must be performed, Company shall notify City as soon as practical after the
emergency work is completed. In making excavations in the streets the Company
shall proceed with such work as to cause the least possible inconvenience to
the public. The Company shall protect property, according to safety standards
generally accepted at the time of placement, or as may be determined by the
Iowa Utilities Board. All excavations and obstruction shall have proper
shoring, surface plates, barricades, warning lights, and such other or
additional devices as circumstances may warrant. The Company shall be exempt
from the permit application requirements of Section
135.09 of this Code of Ordinances as long as the franchise remains in effect.

same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks, curb and gutters, or other
portions of streets and public places opened, disturbed, or damaged by the
Company shall be promptly restored and replaced with like materials by the
Company at its own expense and left in as good condition as before.

the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or
repair of the street or alley or any public improvement of, in or about any
such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any
such improvement. If the City asks the Company to relocate existing facilities
or equipment for the primary benefit of a commercial or private project, a non-
public entity, or for a commercial or private developer, the Company shall
receive payment for the cost of relocation as a precondition to relocating its
existing facilities or equipment. The City shall consider reasonable
alternatives in designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to
cause the Company unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority
under this section. The City shall also provide a reasonable alternative
location for the Companyâ€™s facilities. The City shall give the Company
reasonable advance written notice to vacate a public right-of-way. Vacating a
public right-of-way shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and
maintain existing facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same
are paid to the Company.
111.07Â Â Â INSTALLATION OF METERS.
The Company, its successors, and assigns, shall furnish and install all meters

utility companies. The Company shall provide to the City evidence of such
coverage in the form of a certificate of insurance upon written request. The
Company shall endeavor to provide 30 daysâ€™ notice of cancellation or non-
renewal. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of
the Company under this chapter. The Company shall require contractors or
subcontractors involved in the construction, installation, maintenance, or
operation of Companyâ€™s electric system to maintain insurance coverage
appropriate to the risk and extent of involvement.
111.10Â Â Â FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE.
The franchise granted by this chapter shall not be exclusive.
111.11Â Â Â REGULATION BY CITY.
In the event the State of Iowa or the United States ceases to regulate any
aspect of the delivery of electrical service now regulated by either or both,
the City reserves the right upon such cessation to regulate such matters to the
extent such matters are local affairs impacting the health, safety, or welfare
of the City.
111.12Â Â Â MAPS OF SYSTEM.
The Company shall, promptly after the award of the franchise, make available
for inspection at Company offices, detailed maps of its distribution system
within the franchised area. The Company shall thereafter maintain updated maps
showing the distribution system. Prior to excavating in the rights-of-way, both
parties shall contact and shall follow the procedures therefor of the
corporation organized pursuant to Chapter 480 of the Code of Iowa or an entity
with a similar function utilized by both the City and the Company, currently
the Iowa One-Call System.
111.13Â Â Â SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS.

is reasonably possible.
111.14Â Â Â FRANCHISE FEE.
In its monthly billing, Company shall include a franchise fee of two percent on
the gross receipts from the sale of electricity for customers within the limits
of the City. The Company shall commence collecting the two percent franchise
fee on the date of July 1, 2015. The Grantor shall give the Company a minimum
six-month notice prior to the request to implement an increase in the franchise
fee. Grantor shall be solely responsible for the proper use of any amounts
collected as franchise fees, and shall only use such fees as collected for a
purpose as allowed by applicable law. Collection of the franchise fee shall
cease at the earlier of the Cityâ€™s repeal of the franchise fee or the end of
the franchise term.
111.15Â Â Â FEE APPLIED TO CUSTOMERSâ€™ BILLS.
The franchise fee shall be applied to all customersâ€™ bills in accordance with
Chapters 364.2(f), 423B.5 and 423E.2(3) of the Code of Iowa. The Company shall
not grant exemptions or refunds of the franchise fee beyond that granted by the
Code of Iowa. If at any time the Iowa Utilities Board (or another authority
having proper jurisdiction) prohibits the collection or payment of a franchise
fee, the Company shall be relieved of its obligation to collect and pay to the
City the franchise fee.
111.16Â Â Â COMPANYâ€™S OBLIGATION LIMITED.
City agrees that Companyâ€™s obligations related to the franchise fee are limited
to those obligations set forth in Sections
111.14,

the limits of the City, and the Company shall apply the franchise fee to its
customers who are affected by the annexation or change in the limits of the
City, commencing six months from receipt of the written notice.

notification to be given within 30 days of the tenth or twentieth anniversary

assessment of fees, that create additional burdens upon the Company, or which
delay utility operations.

Federal Regulations Â§Â§76.900 et. seq., as they currently read and hereafter may
be amended, which are herewith incorporated by reference.
114.02Â Â Â RATE REGULATION PROCEEDINGS.
Any rate regulation proceedings conducted under Section
114.01 shall provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of
any interested party, including but not limited to, the City or its designee,
the Cable Operator, subscribers and residents of the franchise area. In
addition to all other provisions required by the laws of the State and by this
Code of Ordinances, and in order to provide for such opportunity for
consideration of the views of any interested party, the City shall take the
following actions:
1.Â Â Â The City shall publish notice as provided by Section 362.4 of the Code of
Iowa and shall mail by certified mail to the Cable Operator a notice of the
intent to conduct a public proceeding on basic service tier rates or charges
for equipment to receive such basic service tier, as defined by the Federal
Communications Commission (â€œFCCâ€).
2.Â Â Â The notice shall state, among other things, that cable television rates

question; that any interested party has a right to participate in the
proceeding; that public views may be submitted in the proceeding, explaining
how they are to be submitted and the deadline for submitting any such views;
that a decision concerning the reasonableness of the cable television rates in
question will be governed by the Rules and Regulations of the FCC; and that the

and eligible individuals or entities. If the City cannot determine the
reasonableness of a proposed rate increase within the time period permitted by
the FCC Rules and Regulations, it may toll the effective date of the proposed
rates for an additional period of time as permitted by the FCC Rules and
Regulations, and issue any other necessary or appropriate order and give public
notice accordingly.
4.Â Â Â In the course of the rate regulation proceeding, the City may request
additional information from the Cable Operator that is reasonably necessary to
determine the reasonableness of the basic service tier rates and equipment
charges. Any such additional information submitted to the City shall be
verified by an appropriate official of the cable television system supervising

foundation protrudes from the ground shall be removed by the City/Cemetery
personnel from the site without notice or accounting to the owner(s) of the
burial lot or the family members of the deceased interred or inurned in the
lot. The City shall not be liable to the lot owner(s) or the family of the
deceased interred or inurned in the lot for any flowers, flower containers or
other commemorative items placed at the gravesite other than on the base or
foundation of the monument that are inadvertently damaged by City/Cemetery

suitable, desirable, appropriate, or within the architectural scheme of the
cemetery.
5.Â Â Â Before any above-surface vault or mausoleum may be erected, the lot owner
shall pay to the City, for future care and maintenance of the structure and
adjoining ground, an amount equal to the cost of the structure. The sum shall
be deposited in the cemetery maintenance fund maintained by the City.

or the assigns of said purchasers a right in fee simple to such lots, lot or
part thereof for the sole purpose of sepulcher alone, for human bodies only,
subject to the rules and regulations and ordinances governing the cemetery as
they exist at the time of interment, and that the City reserves the control of
said lots, lot, or part of lot in the cemetery in order to properly maintain
the cemetery. No deed shall be delivered until the purchaser has made final
payment of the full fee for purchase plus the payment required for perpetual
care. Once the full fee (lot fee and perpetual care fee) is paid, the owner, or
heirs and assigns of the owner, shall be relieved of any annual liability for a
care fee except for mausoleums.
2.Â Â Â Any unoccupied lot will be presumed abandoned when under the conditions
set out in State law for reversions, and the City may sell such reverted lot,
the proceeds from which shall be deposited in the perpetual care fund to
provide for the care of any occupied area of the reverted property or if there
be no occupied portion, the proceeds from the sale portion may be invested, and
the interest thereon be used wherever deemed useful for the care of the
cemetery.
3.Â Â Â The Council shall, from time to time as conditions require, set by
resolution prices for the conveyance of a deed for lots, based on the size and
location of each. The price shall include a portion for perpetual care charge
as set by said resolution. The proceeds from the sale portion shall be
deposited in the General Fund. The prices may be increased and the proportion
for perpetual care changed when the Council finds that the needs of the
cemetery require it.

be made in making either interments, disinterments, or removals, or in the
description, transfer or conveyance of any interment property, either by
canceling such conveyance and substituting and conveying in lieu thereof other
interment property of equal value and similar location as far as possible, or
as may be selected by the City or in the sole discretion of the City, by
refunding the amount of money paid on account of said purchase. In the event
such error shall involve the interment of the remains of any person in such
property, the City reserves the right to remove and transfer such remains to
such other property of equal value and location as far as reasonably possible.
116.08Â Â Â LONG-TERM CARE OF LOTS.
The purchase price shall include a portion to be called the perpetual care
charge, to be set as a percentage of the full price, and the Clerk shall
deposit such amount into a cemetery perpetual care fund. The Council, by
resolution, may accept gifts or donations of land, money, or investment assets
to be placed to the credit of the perpetual care fund. The assets of the
perpetual care fund shall be invested by the Clerk as permitted by State law
for municipal cemetery investments. The City shall use the income from such
investments in caring for the property of the donor, or as provided in the
terms of such gift or donation, or as agreed in the instrument for sale and
purchase of a cemetery lot. Nothing herein required shall be construed as
destroying any vested right as to investments heretofore made prior to the date

be continued until their maturity and then reinvested according to the
provisions of this section.

address, as nearly as possible, of each lot owner, the lot and block number,
the purchase receipt number, date of purchase, and space for recording
transfers. A diagram of the lot shall be drawn on the page, including numbering
and showing the location of each grave. A space is to be provided to record the

shall be recorded and which show all lots purchased.

of deceased, for each body buried. Each card shall contain the deceasedâ€™s full
name, date of birth, date of death or burial, age, grave number, name of
funeral home, and lot and block number. This will supplement the deed book and
burial card records and provide for a starting point when only the name of the
deceased is known.

property rights of plot owners within the cemetery from loss or damage, but it
expressly shall not be liable for loss or damage beyond its control, and

unavoidable disorder, whether the damage be direct or consequential.

grading, fencing, ornamentation, and improvement of all the cemetery grounds
and the avenues leading thereto, from time to time, as in the opinion of the
Council may be necessary and advisable.

shall include, at a minimum, the applicantâ€™s name, address, legal description
of the private property to be served by the curb cut or driveway access, the
length of the curb proposed to be removed, and the width of the driveway access
to be installed or modified. The Public Service Supervisor shall approve the
permit application upon a finding that the curb cut or driveway access
installation or modification proposed will not adversely affect the drainage of
surface water from the public right-of-way and that the exercise of ingress and
egress to and from the private property in question at the proposed location
will not pose a hazard, threat, or concern to pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
In granting any such permit, the Public Service Supervisor shall specify the
time within which the street curbing in question shall be replaced by curbing
of Portland cement. One having been denied a permit following formal
application may appeal the decision to the Council.

which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:
(i) before the start of construction of the improvement; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of
a historic structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structureâ€™s
designation as a historic structure.

160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Apply. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands and development which have significant flood hazards. The Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Jones County and Incorporated Areas, City of
Anamosa, Panels 19105C0125F, 0210F, and 0250F, dated November 19, 2021, which
were prepared as part of the Jones County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used
to identify such flood hazard areas and all areas shown thereon to be within
the boundaries of the base flood shall be considered as having significant
flood hazards. The Jones County Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted by
reference and is made a part of this chapter for the purpose of administering
floodplain management regulations.
2.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the
precise location of the base flood boundary, the location shall be determined
on the basis of the base flood elevation at the particular site in question.
When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Administrator
in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
7.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
160.04Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION.

Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain development permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
structure floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
160.05Â Â Â FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
1.Â Â Â General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant
will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction
of new or replacement bridges or culverts where (i) the bridge or culvert is
located on a stream that drains less than two square miles, and (ii) the bridge
or culvert is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a
channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2), Iowa Administrative Code.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All Development. All development shall within the special flood hazard
areas shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the â€œlowest floorâ€ is five feet or more, the
applicant shall be required to sign and record with the Jones County Recorder a
Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains compliant
with the criteria outlined in this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case on non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non- residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes:

located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
1.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 sq. ft. in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood- resistant materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Paragraph D(1) of this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the
requirements of Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and
elevation of factory-built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual chance
flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood elevation is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A
record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to
North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are floodproofed
shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation
data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.06Â Â Â VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment Shall be
Based - In passing upon applications for Variances, the Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of
this chapter and:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Limitation of periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory
flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.
160.07Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
2.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including
flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
Except as provided in Subsection 1(B) of this section, any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.08Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a simple misdemeanor. Any person who violates
this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not more than $65.00 not more than $650.00 or
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Nothing herein contained prevent the City
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy
violation, but not limited to, the filing of Municipal infractions.
160.09Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.

165.16Â Â Â GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF NONCONFORMITIES.
Within the zoning districts established by this chapter there exist lots,
structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were
lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which are now prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter, or shall be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of future amendment. In
order to manage current and future nonconformities, it is the intent of this
chapter to:
1.Â Â Â Permit current nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not
to encourage their survival.
2.Â Â Â Restrict any further nonconformities from being enlarged upon, expanded,
or extended, or used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
3.Â Â Â Consider legal, as of the date of adoption of this chapter, those
structures which were nonconforming under the previous chapter, but which are
now conforming under this chapter, and to allow such structures to be rebuilt,
added to, or modified within the current terms and requirements of this
chapter.
4.Â Â Â Avoid undue hardship by deeming nothing in this chapter to require a
change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has
been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner.
5.Â Â Â Deem as actual construction those projects where excavation or demolition
or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
165.17Â Â Â NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
In any district in which single- family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of the chapter. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, if the lot shall conform to the other bulk regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements
shall be obtained only through the action of the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
165.18Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY).
Where at the time of passage of this chapter lawful use of land exists which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where
such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding
$1,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided:
1.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
2.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period
of 12 months, then any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is
located.
4.Â Â Â No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter
shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
165.19Â Â Â NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
1.Â Â Â No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in such a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
2.Â Â Â Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure
be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever,
it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved.
165.20Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of
$1,000.00 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be
allowed in the district under the most current terms of this chapter, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions.
1.Â Â Â No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
2.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any
land outside such building.
3.Â Â Â If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to
another nonconforming use provided that the Zoning Board of Adjustment, either
by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Zoning Board of
Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
5.Â Â Â When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18
months during any three-year period (except when government action impedes
access to the premises) the structure, or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
6.Â Â Â When nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of the subsection
is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement
cost at time of destruction. Reconstruction when damaged to less than 50
percent shall begin within six months of the time of destruction or the
nonconforming status shall expire. Said construction shall also be completed
within 18 months of the time of destruction or the nonconforming status shall
expire.
165.21Â Â Â REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
On any structure devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may
be done on ordinary repairs, provided that the cubic content of the building as
it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be
increased.
165.22Â Â Â USES UNDER SPECIAL EXCEPTION PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES.
Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms
of this chapter (other than a change through Zoning Board of Adjustment action
from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the
district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall,
without further action, be considered a conforming use.
165.23Â Â Â SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
1.Â Â Â Planned Unit Development. The owner or owners of any tract of land
comprising an area of not less than 10 acres may submit to the City Council a

shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for study and report
and for public hearing. If the Planning and Zoning Commission approves the
development plan, the plan, together with the recommendation of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, shall then be submitted to the City Council for
consideration and approval. If the City Council approves the plan, development
permits and occupancy certificates from the Zoning/Building Administrator may
be issued even though the use of land and the location of the buildings to be
erected in the area, and the yards and open spaces contemplated by the plans,
do not conform in all respects to the district regulations of the district in
which it is located, except as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Only uses permitted in the R-1 and R-2 Districts shall be permitted.

therefore issued by the Zoning/Building Administrator. No development permit
shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
except after written order from the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Fees for
development permits shall be as provided by City resolution. Development
permits shall be applied for with the City Clerk and shall expire one year
after the date of issuance if work is begun within 180 days of issuance, or

time, but not less than one working day, within which to inspect the site
before the pouring or setting of the footings or foundation to ensure the
building will be built within the parameters of the development permit issued.
If the footings or foundation for the building are poured or set without the
City Public Works Director having been given notice and the opportunity to

assessed the penalty prescribed for municipal infractions under Section
4.03 of this Code of Ordinances. No building shall be occupied or put to use

compliance with the development permit and the provisions of this chapter and
has issued an occupancy permit for the building.
165.26Â Â Â ZONING BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT: POWERS AND DUTIES.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
1.Â Â Â Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Zoning/Building Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any
officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected by any decision of
the Zoning/Building Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within 60 days of
the rendering of the decision by filing with the Zoning/Building Administrator,
and with the Board, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Zoning/Building Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The
appeal shall be acted upon within 30 days of the filing.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and
give not less than seven days nor more than 20 days public notice in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City. At least 7 days immediately
preceding the hearing a sign of at least 12 inches by 18 inches regarding the
action and informing the public of said action and directing attention to the
office of the City Clerk for information on said action shall be conspicuously
placed on the lot in question visible and legible to pedestrian and vehicular
traffic. At said hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent, or by
attorney.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Zoning/Building Administrator from whom
the appeal is taken certifies to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, after the
Notice of Appeal is filed with the Administrator, that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the Administratorâ€™s opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning
Board of Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the
Zoning/Building Administrator from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause
shown.
2.Â Â Â Special Exceptions: Conditions Governing Applications; Procedures. To hear
and decide on, such special exceptions as the Zoning Board of Adjustment is
specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this chapter; to decide such
questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should be
granted; and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as
are appropriate under this chapter, or to deny special exceptions when not in
harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. A special exception shall
not be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a special exception is submitted indicating
the section of this chapter under which the special exception is sought and
stating the grounds on which it is requested.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The special exceptions to be acted by the Board shall be acted upon
within 30 days of the filing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of the special exception and give not less than seven days nor more
than 20 days public notice in a paper of general circulation in the City. At
least seven days immediately preceding the hearing a sign of at least 12 inches
by 18 inches regarding the action and informing the public of said action and
directing attention to the office of the City Clerk for information on said
action shall be conspicuously placed on the lot in question visible and legible
to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. At said hearing, any party may appear in
person, by agency, or by attorney.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by
agent or attorney.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that it is
empowered under the section of this chapter described in the application to
grant the special exception, that the granting of the special exception will
not adversely affect the public interest.
3.Â Â Â Variance, Conditions Governing Application; Procedures. To authorize upon
appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will
not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be
granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of land, structures, or
buildings in other districts may be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The variance shall be acted upon within 30 days of the filing. The
Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the variance and give not
less than seven days nor more than 20 days public notice in a paper of general
circulation in the City. At least seven days immediately preceding the hearing
a sign of at least 12 inches by 18 inches regarding the action and informing
the public of said action and directing attention to the office of the City
Clerk for information on said action shall be conspicuously placed on the lot
in question visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. At said hearing, any
party may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by
agent, or by attorney.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall make findings that requirements of
this section have been met by the applicant for a variance.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
In granting any variance, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable under this chapter. Under no circumstances shall the
Zoning Board of Adjustment grant a variance to allow a use not permissible
under the terms of this chapter in the district involved or any use expressly
or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district.
4.Â Â Â The concurring vote of the majority of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning/
Building Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to affect any
variation in the application of this chapter.
165.27Â Â Â APPEAL PROCESS.
The appeal process for any person, board, taxpayer, department, City board or
bureau, or those from other areas subject to this chapter who have been
aggrieved by any decision regarding City zoning regulations shall be:
1.Â Â Â All questions of interpretation and enforcement of City zoning regulations
shall be first presented to the Zoning/Building Administrator.
2.Â Â Â Such questions shall be next presented to the Zoning Board of Adjustment
only on appeal of the decision of the Zoning/Building Administrator.
3.Â Â Â Lastly, those seeking to appeal a decision of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment may seek review by a court of record of such decision, in the manner
provided by the laws of the State and particularly by Chapter 414 of the Code
of Iowa.
165.28Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.

pending re-zoning application, and directing the publicâ€™s attention to the
office of the City Clerk for further information, shall be conspicuously posted
on the land in question visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. If the
property is inaccessible to public vehicular traffic, the sign shall be posted
at the nearest point of passage by public vehicular traffic.
2.Â Â Â The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries codified in this chapter

another zoning district, or an ordinance approving a site development plan, the
Council may impose conditions on a property owner which are in addition to
existing regulations if the additional conditions have been agreed to in
writing by the property owner before or at the public hearing required under
this section. The conditions must be reasonable and imposed to satisfy public
needs which are directly met by the requested change.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In case, however, of a written protest against a change or repeal which
is filed with the City Clerk and signed by the owners of 20 percent or more of
the area of the lots included in the proposed change or repeal, or by the
owners of 20 percent or more of the property which is located within 200 feet
of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the change or repeal is
proposed, the change or repeal shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the Council.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The protest, if filed, must be filed before or at the public hearing.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Proposed amendments not recommended by the Planning and Zoning

(3/4) of the members of the City Council.

of the City Council.
165.29Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of any of the requirements of this chapter shall constitute a
municipal infraction, with violators subject to the provisions of
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances. Each day a violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. The City shall be entitled to recover all out-
of-pocket costs it incurs in establishing a violation of the provisions of this
chapter (not including attorney fees, unless allowed by State law).
165.30Â Â Â SCHEDULE OF FEES, CHARGES, AND EXPENSES.
The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses and

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the harmonious development of the
City and adjacent territory (i) by establishing appropriate standards for
streets, blocks, lots, utilities, and other improvements (ii) by promoting

the corporate limits of the City for other than agricultural purposes, shall be
submitted to the Council and Planning and Zoning Commission, in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter, and shall be subject to the requirements
established herein. Subdivision plats within two miles of the corporate limits
of the City are subject to review and approval by the City. The proposed
subdivision plat shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for

accompanied by a fee as set by resolution of the Council.
166.04Â Â Â VARIANCES AND WAIVERS.

unreasonable restrictions on the development of a tract of land because of
natural or physical conditions or limitations not created by the owner or
developer, the Commission may recommend and the City Council may grant such
variances from these standards or requirements as may be necessary to permit
the reasonable development of the land while preserving the intent of this
chapter.
2.Â Â Â Waiver of Plats of Survey. All plats of survey, both for premises within
the corporate limits and for premises within two miles of the corporate limits
of the City, must be submitted to the City for review for a determination as to

citizens.
166.05Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT.
In addition to other remedies and penalties prescribed by law, the provisions
of this chapter shall be enforced as follows:
1.Â Â Â No plat or subdivision in the City or within two miles thereof shall be
recorded or filed with the County Auditor or County Recorder, nor shall any
plat or subdivision have any validity until it complies with the provisions of
this chapter and has been approved by the Council as prescribed herein.
2.Â Â Â No more than two building permits shall be issued for each separate tract
existing at the effective date of the ordinance codified herein unless the
tract shall have been platted in accordance with the provisions contained
herein.

with City funds, nor shall any City funds be expended for street maintenance,
street improvements or other services in any area that has been subdivided
after the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter unless the
subdivision and streets have been approved in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and the street accepted by the Council as a public street.
166.06Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.
This chapter may be amended from time to time by the Council. Such amendments
as may be proposed shall first be submitted to the Commission for study and
recommendation. The Commission shall report within 30 days, after which the
Council shall give notice of and hold a public hearing on the proposed
amendment. The amendment shall become effective from and after its adoption and
publication as required by law.
166.07Â Â Â PRELIMINARY PLATTING PROCEDURE.
1.Â Â Â The owner or developer of any tract of land to be subdivided shall cause a
preliminary plat to be prepared of the subdivision containing the information
specified herein, and shall file three copies and a reproducible sepia or
tracing of the plat with the Clerk.
2.Â Â Â The Clerk shall immediately transmit two copies of the preliminary plat to
the Commission for study and recommendation. The Commission shall examine the
plat as to its compliance with this chapter and the comprehensive plan of the
City and shall have 45 days within which to submit a recommendation to the
Council, provided that the owner or developer may agree to an extension of time
not to exceed 60 days.
3.Â Â Â The Council shall, upon receipt of the Commissionâ€™s recommendation or
after 45 days from the date of referral to the Commission or an approved
extension thereof, shall have passed, by resolution, grant approval of or
reject the preliminary plat. Approval of the preliminary plat by the Council
shall constitute approval to proceed with the preparation of the final plat but
shall not be deemed approval of the subdivision.
166.08Â Â Â FINAL PLATTING PROCEDURE.
1.Â Â Â A final plat shall be submitted within 12 months of the approval of the
preliminary plat, or such approval shall expire and the preliminary plat shall
be resubmitted for approval prior to preparation of a final plat.
2.Â Â Â Procedures for final plats shall be the same as set out for preliminary
plats in Section
166.07 above.
3.Â Â Â Upon approval of the final plat, a certification of approval signed by the
Mayor and attested by the Clerk shall be affixed to the original tracing of the
final plat and copies of the same filed with the Clerk, County Auditor, and
County Recorder along with such other certifications and instruments as may be
required by law.
166.09Â Â Â PLATS OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.
Procedure for approval of preliminary and final plats of land within two miles
of the corporate limits shall be the same as set out in Section
166.07 and
166.08 above, except that five copies of the plat shall be filed with the Clerk
and the Clerk shall in addition refer one copy to the City Engineer and one
copy to the City Attorney. The Commission shall not take action prior to
receiving the recommendations of the County Planning and Zoning Commission, if
any, provided that such recommendations shall be received within 30 days of
referral date. All plats of survey within two miles of the corporate limits of
the City submitted to the City for review and approval shall be first submitted
to the City Council for a determination as to whether or not they do constitute
subdivision plats subject to the Cityâ€™s review and approval. Review and
approval of plats of survey that do not amount to subdivision plats shall be
waived by the City Council following this initial review.

Â 
167.01Â Â Â PURPOSE.
In order to further promote the safe and efficient use of land and to further
enhance the value of property in the City, the Council deems it advisable to
establish a Site Plan Review Process for any construction of 2,500 square feet
or more; or which brings existing gross floor area to 2,500 square feet or
more, for which a Construction/Development Permit is required, except for
construction of single-family and two-family residential structures or
structures accessory thereof. However, Section
167.13 of this chapter will still apply to single- family and two-family
residential structures or structures accessory thereof. Site Plan Review is
also required for any parking lot construction of eight or more parking spaces.
This review is intended to supplement the review and administrative procedures
which are carried out under other City policies or ordinances. The Site Plan
Review process is intended to help ensure that newly developed properties or
redeveloped properties are compatible with adjacent development and that
safety, traffic; over-crowding, and environmental problems are minimized to the
extent possible. The Site Plan must include landscaping plans as required by
landscaping regulations within this chapter. No Construction/Development Permit
shall be issued until Site Plan approval is obtained where applicable. Site
Plan Review will also apply to all areas within two miles of the corporate
limits of the City, where such development will have an impact on the Cityâ€™s
traffic or waterways.

The procedures prescribed by these guidelines are not intended to be a
substitute for, or to have any bearing upon, any procedures required under
Chapter 165 (Zoning Regulations) of this Code of Ordinances. If a proposed Site
Plan involves the granting of a special exception or a variance from the
requirements of
Chapter 165, the Development and Construction Committee may review the Plan in
advance of the zoning proceedings and may make findings on the assumption that
the special exception or variance will be granted. However, such findings shall
not constitute a position by the City or by any employee of the City in support
of the petitionerâ€™s application for a special exception or variance and shall
not be received in evidence in any proceedings before the Zoning Board of
Adjustment. The report of the Development and Construction Committee in such
cases shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Adjustment concurrently with
the application.
167.10Â Â Â FORMS AND FEES.

167.15Â Â Â PURPOSE OF LANDSCAPE PLAN REVIEW.
The regulations covering landscape plan review are intended to provide uniform
standards for the development and maintenance of landscaping on private
property and public right-of-way. Landscaping improves livability of
residential neighborhoods; it enhances the appearance and customer attraction
of commercial area; it increases property values; it improves the compatibility
of adjacent uses; it screens undesirable views; and it can reduce air and noise
pollution. The intent of these regulations is to achieve a reasonable balance
between the right of individuals to develop and maintain their property in a
manner they prefer and the right of the City residents to live, work, shop, and
recreate in pleasant and attractive surroundings. The results of this effort
will be the strengthening of the economic stability of the Cityâ€™s business,
cultural, and residential areas. The intent of these regulations is to work
with new construction and new subdivisions. The intent is to also regulate
plantings within the public right-of-way. In addition, the intent of this
chapter is to prevent plantings which would jeopardize the safety of vehicles,
property, and, most importantly, people. It is not the intent of this chapter
to regulate existing developed private property except in areas as stated
within this chapter.
167.16Â Â Â LANDSCAPE PLANS REQUIRED.

landscape architect or a landscape professional who has been in the landscape
business a minimum of three years. Said plan must be approved by the Zoning/
Building Administrator.
2.Â Â Â New residential subdivisions will show requirements for all lots to have
approved trees planted within one year after structure is completed. As a
minimum, for each lot an approved tree must be planted in the front or front
side yard and rear yard or rear side yard. Said requirement shall be part of
the subdivision covenants.
3.Â Â Â A landscape plan is required for all residential except single and two-
family dwellings, commercial, professional office and industrial developments,
redevelopments, additions, or changes in usage. When same is adjacent to a
residentially zoned area, a landscape plan showing a landscape buffer between
the different zoned areas is required. All preliminary and final landscape
plans shall have the following information:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â North point and scale.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Topographic information and final grading adequate to identify and
properly specify planting for areas needing slope protection.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The location, size, and surface of materials of all structures and

structures and ground mounted mechanical equipment shall be adequately
screened. This includes building mounted utility and mechanical equipment.
167.17Â Â Â LANDSCAPE DESIGN ELEMENTS.
The following basic design elements shall be used in the preparation of a
landscape plan:
1.Â Â Â Landscaping shall be used to provide an interesting open space and to
break the visual impact of parking areas.
2.Â Â Â Encourage trees and landscape vegetation to screen unsightly views, soften
hard architectural lines, frame buildings and views, and buffer between
contrasting or lower land uses.
3.Â Â Â Planting design shall coordinate appropriate new plant materials and other
environment requirements.
4.Â Â Â The overall quality of existing landscape material shall be considered and
treated in the planting design in a similar manner to new landscape material.
5.Â Â Â Service areas and facilities shall be screened from major points of
pedestrian access of all buildings and from the public right-of-way.
6.Â Â Â Landscape materials shall be selected and arranged to prevent blocking or
obscuring night lighting of pedestrian ways at any stage of growth.
7.Â Â Â Plantings at intersections or driveway entrances off a public or private
street shall be arranged to allow a permanent safe sight distance. No
plantings, with an ultimate mature height exceeding 18 inches, shall be planted
within the required sight-distance landscape setback triangle.
8.Â Â Â If plantings occur that are determined to be a safety hazard due to
restrictions of sight distance, property owner shall be notified by the Public
Works Director or Chief of Police to abate hazard. Said notification shall be
such as to give property owner sufficient time to abate hazard. If hazard is
not abated after proper notification, Public Works Director shall cause said
hazard to be removed and removal and administrative cost shall be borne by
property owner.
