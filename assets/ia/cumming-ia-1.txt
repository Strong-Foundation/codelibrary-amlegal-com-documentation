3.06 ALTERNATIVE PENALTIES.

citation for a violation of this Code of Ordinances or regulation if criminal
penalties are also provided for the violation. Nor does it preclude or limit

80.02 AUTHORITY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.
Â Â Â A police authority, upon the authorityâ€™s own initiative or upon the request
of any other authority having the duties of control of highways or traffic,
shall take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and may take
into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority
may employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private
entity, equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving,
storing, or disposing of abandoned vehicles. A property owner or other person
in control of private property may employ a private entity that is a garage
keeper to dispose of an abandoned vehicle, and the private entity may take into
custody the abandoned vehicle without a police authorityâ€™s initiative. If a
police authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles, the
police authority shall provide the private entity with the names and addresses
of the registered owners, all lienholders of record, and any other known
claimant to the vehicle or the personal property found in the vehicle.

vehicle, describe the personal property found in the vehicle, set forth the

persons receiving the notice of their right to reclaim the vehicle and personal
property within 10 days after the effective date of the notice upon payment of
all towing, preservation, and storage charges resulting from placing the
vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The notice
shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authorityâ€™s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity
may claim a garage keeperâ€™s lien as described in Section 321.90 of the Code of

property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,
title, claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders or claimants after the
expiration of the 10-day reclaiming period.

80.04 NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.
Â Â Â If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05 FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
Â Â Â The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay $25.00 if claimed within five
days of impounding, plus $5.00 for each additional day within the reclaiming
period plus towing charges, if stored by the City, or towing and storage fees,
if stored in a public garage, whereupon said vehicle shall be released. The
amount of towing charges, and the rate of storage charges by privately owned
garages, shall be established by such facility.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.06 DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.
Â Â Â If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided herein, the
police authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether or
not the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall
dispose of the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.07 DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.
Â Â Â The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is found
any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle
whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
Â Â Â Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be
deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09 DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
Â Â Â Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor
vehicle for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or otherwise demolish
such motor vehicle. A demolisher shall not junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or
demolish a vehicle until the demolisher has obtained the junking certificate
issued for the vehicle.

by the owner at the ownerâ€™s expense.
97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES.
Â Â Â When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâ€™s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
Â Â Â All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

BENEFITED SEWER DISTRICTS
Â 
101.01 Purpose 101.03 Procedure
101.02 Intent  101.04 South Service Area Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District
Â 
101.01 PURPOSE.
Â Â Â The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a
procedure to be utilized to recover the cost of designing and constructing
major sanitary sewer facilities in those instances in which a significant
number of the properties to be benefited by such facilities are not
sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of those costs through the
special assessment process as provided in Chapter 384, Division IV of the Code
of Iowa. The City hereby declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as
herein provided, to recover the costs of designing and constructing such major
sanitary sewer facilities from property owners who connect to such facilities
subsequent to their construction.
101.02 INTENT.
Â Â Â  It is the intent of this chapter to set forth the method of recovery of
proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect their
properties to major sanitary sewer facilities subsequent to their construction,
so that in the event that all property, other than street and road right-of-
way, which lies within the benefited district is connected to the major
sanitary sewer facilities during their expected useful life, then those
properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up to 100 percent of the cost of
designing and constructing such facilities, including legal, administrative and
interest expenses associated therewith.
101.03 PROCEDURE.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event the Council determines the necessity of constructing a
major sanitary sewer facility, and determines that the utilization of a
connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to recover the City's
costsÂ associated therewith, the Council shall cause a â€œNotice of Public Hearing
on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish a Connection Fee District
and a Connection Feeâ€ to be published in a newspaper having general circulation
in the City as hereinafter provided. In addition to indicating the date, time,
and place of the public hearing, the notice shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Indicate the nature and extent of the major sanitary sewer facility
or facilities constructed or under consideration for construction, as well as
the estimated cost or costs for the design and construction of same;
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Identify by general description the proposed connection fee district
to be served by the major sanitary sewer facility or facilities; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by
property owners within the benefited district who connect to said facilities,
expressed in dollars per acre of land area served or such other method as the
City shall determine to be equitable for the benefited district.
Â Â Â The notice shall state that the proposed connection fee district ordinance
is on file, along with a plat of the area to be served, and both are available
for public inspection in the office of the City Clerk. The notice shall be
published not more than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the
scheduled date of the public hearing, and shall be mailed to each property
owner within the connection fee district as shown by the records of the County
Auditor.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â At the public hearing, the owners of property within the proposed
connection fee district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as
to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The necessity for the project;
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major sanitary
sewer facilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The proposed connection fee.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee district ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed
connection fee district ordinance, the Council may:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities from the proposed project and the properties served thereby from the
connection fee district proposed, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The connection fee district ordinance may provide, at the Councilâ€™s
discretion, that single-family residences within the connection fee district,
in existence or under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance,
and located within the corporate limits of the City, are eligible for
connection to the major sanitary sewer facility. In that event, the ordinance
shall include the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â That the owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, payment of
the connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at the ownerâ€™s expense, of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the City, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â That the owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, payment of
the connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at the owner's expense, of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the City. Any
future development of said parcel shall necessitate a revised application for
connection and payment of the appropriate connection fee. The connection fee
for the remainder parcel shall be payable at such time as the remainder parcel
shall be connected to the major sanitary sewer facility.
Â Â Â The connection fee district ordinance may also provide, at the Councilâ€™s
discretion, that sanitary sewer service can be provided to recreational and
park facilities, and to commercial and industrial parcels and facilities, in
the same manner and under the same procedures set forth in this section for
single family residences within the connection fee district. All other property
located within the corporate limits of the City and within a connection fee
district shall be eligible for connection to the major sanitary sewer facility
upon approval of an application for connection by the owner thereof, as
hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for such property,
provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for development, and,
where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements necessary to serve said
property have been constructed, at the owner's expense, and accepted by the
City.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â After adoption, publication and recording of a connection fee district
ordinance by the City Clerk, all owners of those properties within the
benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major sanitary
sewer facility, shall make application to the City for such connection. The
submittal of construction plans to the City for sanitary sewer improvements on
property being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to
the City for purposes of this chapter. The sewer connection fee shall be due
and payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the
major sanitary sewer facility. No connection shall be made to a major sanitary
sewer facility until such application has been approved and until the required
connection fee has been paid. The sewer connection fee required by a connection
fee district ordinance and this chapter shall be paid before the City will
approve the final plat of property subject to the connection fee.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The sewer connection fee shall be in an amount equal to the maximum
acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof, within the connection
fee district under common ownership which can be lawfully served through such
proposed connection, multiplied by the per acre connection fee or such other
fee basis as determined for the benefited district established in the
connection fee district ordinance for that district. The connection fee
district ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with annual
interest adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later years pay
interest on the connection fee for their property. The rate of interest
applicable to the connection fee established in each connection fee district
shall not exceed the rate of interest applicable to special assessments
pursuant to Chapter 74A and Section 384.60(3) of the Code of Iowa in effect on
the date that the connection fee was established for that district by enactment
of a connection fee district ordinance.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Property outside of the connection fee district would be eligible for
connection to a major sanitary sewer facility only upon the approval of an
application for connection by the owner thereof, a determination by the City
that sufficient capacity exists in the major sanitary sewer facility to serve
such area outside of the boundaries of the connection fee district and
following payment of a fee calculated on the same basis as if the property were
located within the connection fee district. Without approval of the City and
payment of the applicable fee, no property outside of the connection fee
district may connect to the major sanitary sewer facility constructed to serve
the connection fee district. The City may waive the requirement for payment of
the applicable fee.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The sewer connection fee required by a connection fee district
ordinance and this chapter shall be due and payable to the City.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The sewer connection fee required by a connection fee district
ordinance and this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
fees for connection required under the plumbing code or other provisions of the
Code of Ordinances of the City.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â In the event any property owner connects his or her property within a
connection fee district or property outside a connection fee district to a
major sanitary sewer facility for which a benefited distribution has been
established, without having made application therefore or without having
received approval thereof, or without having paid the required connection fee
established by a connection fee district ordinance, the City shall be entitled
to disconnect such private sewer connection until such time as the property
owner has made and received approval of the application, and has paid the
required connection fee.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Any person violating the provisions of this chapter by connecting to a
major sanitary sewer facility without having complied with the provisions of
this chapter shall be punished as provided in
Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances of the City.

operator shall remove the abandoned system at their expense. Removal of the
system includes the entire structure, transmission equipment, and fencing from
the property excluding foundations. Non-function or lack of operation may be
proven by reports from the interconnected utility. For off grid systems the
City shall have the right to enter the property at its sole discretion to
determine if the off grid system is generating power. Such generation may be
proven by use of an amp meter. The owner/operator and successors shall make
available to the City all reports to and from the purchaser of energy from the
SWECS if requested. If removal of towers and appurtenant facilities is
required, the City shall notify the owner/operator.
Â Â Â 22.Â Â Â By the acceptance of a conditional use permit or building permit to
authorize construction of a SWECS, the owner/operator grants permission to the
City to enter the property to remove the SWECS pursuant to the terms of
approval and to assure compliance with the other conditions set forth in the
permit. Removal shall be at the expense of the owner/operator.
158.04 BULK REGULATIONS.

160.18 CONDITIONAL USES, APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Appointment and Duties of the Board of Adjustment. A Board of
Adjustment is hereby established, which shall hear and decide: (i) applications
for conditional uses upon which the Board is authorized to pass under this
chapter; (ii) appeals; and (iii) requests for variances to the provisions of
this chapter; and shall take any other action which is required of the Board.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Conditional Uses. Requests for conditional uses shall be submitted to
the Administrator, who shall forward such to the Board of Adjustment for
consideration. Such requests shall include information ordinarily submitted
with applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the
Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration
of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal,
an application for a conditional use or a request for a variance, the Board
shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in
interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may require the
appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed
necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a
professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal,
conditional use, or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an
appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make
its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons
for its decision. In granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant
sections of this chapter and may prescribe such conditions as contained in
Section
160.20.
160.19 FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES IS BASED.
Â Â Â In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The importance of the service provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for the area.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwater expected at the site.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
160.20 CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO VARIANCES.
Â Â Â Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but not
necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Limitation on periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Flood proofing measures designed consistent with the flood protection
elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, durations, rate of rise,
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with the
regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the applicant
submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that
the flood proofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.21 APPEALS TO THE COURT.
Â Â Â  Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of
the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of record a petition, duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part,
specifying the grounds of illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the
court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
Board.
160.22 NONCONFORMING USES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this chapter but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Except as provided in subsection B above, any use which has been
permitted as a conditional use or variance shall be considered a conforming
use.
160.23 AMENDMENTS. Â 
Â Â Â The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the

redevelopment of land under the control and in accordance with a Master Plan
and development guidelines and standards in which the land uses, transportation
elements, building densities, arrangements, and types are set out in a unified
plan, which may provide greater flexibility of land use, transfer of
development rights within the PUD, bulk regulations, and building locations
than the conventional zoning district may permit. The PUD District is intended
to: maximize benefits from the use of open spaces; maximize aesthetics;
encourage certain architectural standards for buildings, permit mixed uses and
diversity of bulk regulations without endangering the health, safety, welfare,
and land value of surrounding and internal properties. A PUD may consist of a
mix of land uses of residential building types, commercial, and limited
industrial, provided such Planned Unit Development is compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan of the City.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Minimum Size, Land Use and Maximum Density. A PUD shall consist of at
least 10 acres, land use types compatible with the Comprehensive Plan of the
City, and the density of the PUD shall not be in excess of the density
permitted by this section and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan. A Planned
Unit Development may include multiple-family or two-family dwellings in areas
designated as R-1 zoning in the Comprehensive Plan, if the proposed land use is
compatible with land uses adjoining and outside the PUD, and the dwelling unit
density of the PUD is not greater than 10 percent greater than the maximum
density permitted by the underlying zoning as set forth in this subsection. The
maximum number of dwelling units permitted in a PUD in areas of the City
designated as RE-1, R-1, and R-2 shall be based on the following maximum
dwelling unit per acre density by proposed zoning district:
Â 
Zoning District Maximum District Density
RE-1            1 dwelling unit per acre
R-1 (100)       2 dwelling units per acre
R-1 (90)        2.6 dwelling units per acre
R-1(80)         3 dwelling units per acre

Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve or disapprove the PUD
Master Plan and associated development rules, regulations and guidelines as
submitted, or may require the developer to modify, alter, adjust or amend the
proposed Master Plan and associated rules, regulations and guidelines, as the
Commission deems necessary, in order to preserve the harmonious intent and
purpose of this Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An application for approval of PUD shall be deemed a petition for
rezoning to the PUD Zoning District, but prior to an affirmative report from
the Commission the applicant shall file the necessary petition as prescribed in
Amendments, Section
165.45.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Before any report is forwarded to the City Council by the Planning
and Zoning Commission pertaining to an application submitted for a PUD, said
Commission shall determine if such proposal is compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan or if such proposal represents a substantial change to the
Comprehensive Plan. The Commission shall hold a public hearing, giving notice
as provided by law for a rezoning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â After a complete review by the Planning and Zoning Commission, a
written recommendation and report giving reasons as to their action shall be
filed with the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Within a period of 60 days after the City Council has received a
report from the Planning and Zoning Commission, together with the proposed

the City Council with appropriate recommendations. The City Council shall then
take such appropriate action on the proposed modification and their decision
shall be final. No modification may be considered that is more than a 10
percent increase in density or change of uses on the site without a public
hearing as required of a rezoning procedure. A public hearing may be required
before the City Council on any modification, if determined by the Council. All

165.26 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Statement of Intent. It is recognized that while a home occupation in
and of itself is an acceptable use within a residential area, it is when those
uses take on a more commercial character that conflicts arise. This section is
intended to protect residential districts from potential adverse impacts of
activities defined as home occupations and to ensure that home occupations do
not have a negative impact upon the residential area in which they are located;
to permit residents of the community a broad choice in the use of their homes
as a place of livelihood in the production or supplementing of personal/family
income; to restrict incompatible uses; and to establish criteria and develop
standards for the use of residential structures or dwelling units for home
occupations. It is not the intent to eliminate certain home-based businesses
and occupations which may be compatible with the residential areas.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Criteria. The following are the criteria for Home Occupations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No Exterior Display. There shall be no exterior display except for a
sign, as specified in paragraph D below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Design Features. The building shall include no features
of design not customary for residential use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Residential Character. The building or premises occupied shall not
be rendered objectionable or detrimental to the residential character of the
neighborhood due to exterior appearance or by the emission of dust, gas, noise,
odor, smoke, or in any other way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Signs. Any sign utilized by a home occupation in a Residential
District shall be limited to one building-mounted sign which shall not exceed
one square foot in area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Equipment. Any merchandise or stock in trade sold, repaired or
displayed shall be stored entirely within the residential structure or in an
accessory building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Employment. The home occupation shall be carried on by a member of
the family residing in the dwelling unit, employing not more than two
nonresident persons outside the immediate family residing on the premises.

165.28 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND AND STRUCTURES.
Â Â Â  Within the various districts established by the Zoning Ordinance, as
amended, there exist uses of land and structures that were lawfully in
existence prior to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto,
but which do not conform to the current provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, as
amended. These uses are defined for purposes of the Zoning Ordinance as
nonconforming uses. It is the intent of the Zoning Ordinance to avoid undue
hardship to the owners of nonconforming uses by permitting nonconforming uses
to continue until they are removed. However, nonconforming uses are declared by
the Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible with conforming uses in the districts
involved and to have an adverse impact on orderly development or on the market
value of properties with conforming uses.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Nonconforming Use of Land. The nonconforming use of land upon which no
structure is erected or constructed may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied immediately before the use
became nonconforming.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to
any other portion of the lot or parcel that was not occupied by such use
immediately before the use became nonconforming.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
continuous period of three months, any subsequent use of such land thereafter
shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which such land
is located. However, if the nonconforming use is a seasonal use, to the extent
that the use consistently is not operated during an off-season time period each
year, then the off-season time period shall not be considered a period when the
use has ceased for purposes of this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use is changed to or replaced by a
conforming use, the use shall not thereafter be changed back to the
nonconforming use.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Nonconforming Use of Structures. The nonconforming use of a structure,
or of a structure and land in combination, may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No structure devoted to such nonconforming use shall be enlarged,
extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, unless the subsequent
use of the structure and land in combination is brought into conformity with
the district regulations for the district in which the structure and land are
located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land
in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a continuous period of three
months, any subsequent use of such structure, or structure and land in
combination, thereafter shall conform to the district regulations for the
district in which the structure and land is located. However, if the
nonconforming use is a seasonal use, to the extent that the use consistently is
not operated during an off-season time period each year, then the off-season
time period shall not be considered a period when the use has ceased for
purposes of this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an
extent of 50 percent or more of its market value at the time of destruction,
then such structure's nonconforming status shall terminate, and if such
structure is reconstructed the subsequent use of the structure and land in
combination shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which
the structure and land is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If any nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an
extent of less than 50 percent of its market value at the time of destruction,
such structure may be reconstructed provided that the reconstruction project
must be commenced within six months from the date of partial destruction and
must be diligently prosecuted to completion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Repairs and Alterations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Ordinary repairs and alterations may be made to nonconforming
structures, provided that no structural alterations may be made to such
nonconforming structures. A nonconforming residential building may be repaired
or altered to improve livability and health conditions, provided that no change
in the number of dwelling units is permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If any official charged with protecting the public safety declares
any building or part thereof to be unsafe and orders that action be taken for
the restoring of such building to a safe condition, nothing in the Zoning
Ordinance shall be interpreted to prohibit such action.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Unlawful Uses are Not Nonconforming Uses. The nonconforming use
regulations of this section are applicable only to uses of land and structures
that were lawfully in existence prior to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance,
or amendment thereto, but which do not conform to the current provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance, as amended. Any use of land, use of structure, or use of a
structure and land in combination that, immediately prior to the adoption of
the Zoning Ordinance or amendment thereto, was not a lawful use under the
previous zoning regulations, shall not be authorized to have nonconforming
status under this section.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Annexation. The nonconforming use regulations of this section are
applicable to all structures and uses of land and structures that were lawfully
in existence prior to the annexation of the subject property into the City, but
which would be prohibited or restricted after annexation under the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto.

inorganic mulch materials shall be shown and identified on the landscape plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Vegetation. The use and incorporation of plant materials shall
adhere to the following guidelines, standards, and design principles:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Vegetation should be located to simulate nature with groupings
and massing rather than linear or symmetrical lines unless such lines are for
intentional design intent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Plant size at maturity should dictate spacing, however, spacing
may be altered for design intent provided care is given not to overcrowd
plants.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All plants shall be commercially grown and shall meet all
requirements set forth by the current edition of the â€œAmerican Standards for
Nursery Stockâ€ (ANSI).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â As much as possible, plant materials that are native or
adaptable to local climactic and moisture conditions should be implemented.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â For visual interest and to limit the spread of disease or
insects, multiple plant species and genus shall be used. Unless otherwise
specifically allowed by the appropriate approval body for design intent, each
type of vegetation (deciduous overstory, deciduous understory, evergreen,
shrubs, etc.) required shall be comprised of a minimum of three (3) varieties
to limit the spread of disease or insects and prevent the total loss of a
vegetation type within a site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Trees shall not be planted in any space with less than five feet
(5â€™) clearance in any direction with the exception of trees planted in tree
wells in paved areas and specifically designed for such purpose.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Trees shall not be planted within six feet (6â€™) to the back of
curb of any vehicle travel lane or four feet (4â€™) to any paved area, including
sidewalks and trails.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â No plants other than ground covers or perennials with a maximum
height of fifteen inches (15â€) shall be planted within five feet (5â€™) of fire
hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be shown on the landscape plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â No plants other than ground covers or perennials with a maximum
height of fifteen inches (15â€) shall be planted within five feet (5â€™) of Fire
Department connections. Fire Department connections shall be shown on the
landscape plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Trees that will overhang pedestrian areas shall be pruned to
provide a minimum clear height of eight feet (8â€™).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Trees that will overhang vehicle travel areas shall be pruned
to provide a minimum clear height of fifteen feet (15â€™).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â The following minimum plant sizes and dimensions are required
at the time of planting:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Deciduous overstory trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter
of two inches (2â€) measured six inches (6â€) above the root collar and shall
have a minimum five feet (5â€™) of clear trunk. Clump varieties (2 or more stems)
are allowed and each stem shall measure a minimum diameter of two inches (2â€).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Deciduous understory trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter
of one and one-half inches (1 Â½â€) measured at six inches (6â€) above the root
collar and shall have a minimum three and one-half foot (3 Â½â€™) clear trunk.
Clump varieties (2 or more stems) are allowed and each stem shall measure a
minimum diameter of one inch (1â€).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Deciduous shrubs that reach a mature height greater than five
feet (5â€™) shall be installed at a minimum of three feet (3â€™) in height.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Deciduous shrubs that reach a mature height between three (3â€™)
and five feet (5â€™) shall be installed at a minimum of two feet (2â€™) in height.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Deciduous shrubs that reach a mature height of less than three
feet (3â€™) shall be installed at a minimum height of fifteen inches (15â€).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Evergreen trees shall be installed at a minimum height of six
feet (6â€™).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Evergreen shrubs shall be installed at a minimum height of two
feet (2â€™).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Evergreen ground covers (mat evergreens) shall measure a
minimum spread of fifteen inches (15â€).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Climbing vines and ornamental grasses shall have been grown in
a quart container for a minimum of one year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â Ground covers and perennials shall be a minimum of a four-inch
(4â€) container, #SP4, round or square.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â Annuals may be as â€œplugâ€ or â€œpack.â€
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Berms. Berms shall adhere to the following guidelines, standards,
and design principles:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Berms shall be designed in an undulating manner so as to give
the appearance of being naturally formed unless non-undulating forms are for
intentional design intent and approved by the appropriate reviewing body.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Berms shall not have a negative impact on stormwater management
for a development or the surrounding area. The requirement for stormwater
management does not negate the requirement for berms.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Berms required for screening purposes shall be an average of
three feet (3â€™) in height and may be required to be higher if berm height and
associated landscaping is deemed to not be sufficient to adequately provide
required screening.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Berms shall have a slope no greater than three to one (3:1).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Berms shall be planted with permanent ground cover (turf or
other plants) to stabilize the slope and prevent erosion. Rocking of berms as a
ground cover material is prohibited; however, rock boulders (8 inches or
greater in size) may be implemented within the side slopes to aid in
stabilizing the soil, obtain additional berm height, and/or for visual
interest.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Buffers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Buffer Requirements. The requirements set forth in this section
shall apply to any development or redevelopment of property within the City of
Cumming.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Statement of Intent. The use of physical barriers or buffers is
considered a necessary requirement to allow for the transition from one zoning
district or use to another contrasting zoning district or use in recognition of
neighborâ€™s rights, to promote the coordination of neighborhood efforts and
compatibility of neighborhood elements, and to protect the value of buildings
and property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Conditions for Requiring A Buffer. The following conditions
shall require a buffer:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Buffers shall be required as shown on the Table of Buffer
Requirements where different zoning classifications abut. A buffer required by
the table shall be provided by the proposed development when it is located in a
zoning district listed in the left-most column of the table and the development
abuts a zoning district listed across the top of the table.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Where a proposed development is located adjacent to a Plan
Unit Development (PUD) District, a buffer shall be required based on the
existing uses in the area adjacent to the proposed development or the most
intense uses permitted by the PUD District if the area adjacent to the proposed
development is vacant. The buffer required shall be based on the Table of
Buffer Requirements using the zoning district in which the existing or proposed
uses permitted in the PUD District are first permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Buffer Standards. Buffer standards are stated in terms of the
width of the buffer and the number of plant units required per one hundred
(100) linear feet. The width of each buffer shall, at a minimum, meet the
standard buffer width. The City Council, with recommendation from the Planning
and Zoning Commission, may allow the described narrower buffer widths.
The â€œplant unit multiplierâ€ is a factor by which the basic number of plant
materials required for a given buffer is determined given a change in width of
that yard. The number of plant materials required shall be rounded up when a
fraction is calculated. The type and quantity of plant materials required by
each buffer, and each buffer option, are specified in this section. These
standards are minimum requirements. More plantings, wider buffers, or higher
structures may be provided.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â *P&Z & Council approval needed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Buffer Wall Standards. A buffer wall may be permitted with
specific approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, when
it can be shown that a traditional landscaped buffer is not feasible. A buffer
wall shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height; constructed of a permanent
low maintenance material such as brick, concrete, precast concrete, tile block,
etc.; the wall shall be designed by an architect or engineer for both
structural adequacy and aesthetic quality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Burden of Provision of Buffer. The burden of provision and
selection of the buffer shall be as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Where two different zoning districts, requiring a buffer
between them, are both in an existing improved condition, the above requirement
is not retroactive and should a buffer be desired, it shall be by mutual
agreement between property owners or as otherwise provided by law. However, in
the event of any or all of the improved property is abandoned, destroyed,
demolished, etc., for the purpose of renewal or redevelopment, etc., that
portion of such property being renewed or redeveloped, etc., shall be
considered vacant land subject to the requirements herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Where one of two different zoning districts requiring a buffer
between them is partially developed, the developer of the vacant land shall
assume the burden, unless otherwise specified herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Where both zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them,
are vacant or undeveloped, the burden shall be assumed by the developer of the
more intense use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Reduction of Buffer Requirements. Where the line between two
districts, requiring a buffer, follows a street, right-of-way, railroad,
stream, or other similar barrier, the required buffer width may be reduced,
according to the buffer standards tables, with the exception that a buffer wall
will still require City Council approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Waiver of Buffer Requirements. Where the line between two
districts, requiring a buffer, follows a street, right-of-way, railroad,
stream, or other similar barrier, the requirement for a buffer may be waived by
the City Council upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, provided such waiver does not permit the exposure of undesirable
characteristics of land use to the adjoining zoning district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Streetscape and Building Wall Plantings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A landscaped edge or streetscape should be provided along all
streets upon which the public is permitted to travel regardless of whether they
are public or private. There are no minimum landscaping requirements for
streetscapes, however, landscaping placed along streetscapes shall be allowed
to count towards required open space landscaping unless said landscaping is
part of a required buffer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Streetscapes are intended to be ornamental in nature bringing
needed green to the City, shade and visual softening of pavement expanses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Streetscapes should attempt to have a recognizable pattern that
establishes a sense of place for a particular neighborhood or development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Blank building walls uninterrupted by architectural features
should be visually broken by vegetation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Screening. The implementation of landscaping, berms, decorative
walls and fences shall be used to screen undesirable views such as headlight
glare, mechanical equipment, outdoor storage, loading areas, off street parking
areas, etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Off street parking areas: see 165.47 of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Outdoor storage: see Chapter 166, â€œArchitectural Standards,â€ of
this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Mechanical units: see Chapter 166, â€œArchitectural Standards,â€ of
this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Trash enclosures: see Chapter 166, â€œArchitectural Standards,â€ of
this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Additional screening measures may be required at the discretion
of the Zoning Administrator to mitigate impacts and views not otherwise covered
by this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Off Street Parking Areas. Vegetation in off street parking areas not
only provides needed visual relief from large expanses of parking but also
provides shade reducing the heat glare from parking areas thus improving
pedestrian comfort. Views of off-street parking areas from public rights of way
shall be screened to a height of at least three feet (3â€™). Screening shall be
as near to one hundred percent (100%) opacity as possible with careful
attention paid to eliminate â€œthrough viewsâ€ under tree canopies. In addition to
the general landscaping regulations above, the following off-street parking
area landscaping requirements shall also apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The use of multiple small parking lots shall be encouraged
rather than one large parking lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Multiple landscaped islands shall be used and combined with
vegetation to effectively break up large expanses of parking. Location of
islands should be carefully considered to provide shade to as much of the
parking area as possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The location of islands shall allow for the easy and free
movement of all emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Landscaped islands shall be placed, at a minimum, every eighteen
(18) stalls within a row of parking. Landscaped islands shall be, at a minimum,
nine feet (9â€™) wide and thirty-four feet (34â€™) in length for dual parking rows
or a minimum of nine feet (9â€™) wide and seventeen feet (17â€™) in width for
single rows.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Landscaped pods (tree diamonds) within a row of parking shall be

165.42 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT; POWERS AND DUTIES.

there is error in order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
administrative official in the enforcement of these regulations.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Special Exceptions; Conditions Governing Applications and Procedures.

questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should be
granted, to grant special exceptions with such restrictions and conditions as
are appropriate under these regulations, and to deny special exceptions when
not in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations. A special
exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and until the following
requirements are satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application and Hearing Procedures. The following procedures shall
apply to all requests for special exceptions before the Board:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A written application for a special exception must be submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds upon which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notice shall be given at least seven days in advance of a public
hearing on the application by posting notice in a conspicuous place at Cumming
City Hall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear and
participate at the public hearing, either in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In granting any application for a special exception, the Board
shall set forth its decision in writing, and the written decision shall contain
findings that the Board is empowered under the applicable section of this
chapter to grant the special exception and that the granting of the special
exception will not adversely affect the public interest.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A $100.00 non-refundable application fee shall accompany each
application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Conditions to Authorization. In granting any special exception, the
Board may prescribe such restrictions and conditions with respect to the
permitted use as the Board deems reasonable to further the objectives of these
regulations. Violations of such restrictions and conditions, when made a part
of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations. Except as specifically provided in a decision
by the Board to grant a special exception, the permitted use shall conform to
all applicable regulations of the district or districts in which it is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Time Limitations. The Board may prescribe a time limit within which
the action for which the special exception is required to commence or
terminate, or both. Failure to commence or terminate, or both, such action
within the prescribed time limit set shall void the special exception.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Reversion. If the use authorized under an approved special exception
is not initiated within one year of approval of the special exception, or if
the use authorized under an approved special exception is discontinued or
abandoned for a continuous period of one year, then the right to maintain or
continue the special exception shall terminate by operation of law without any
further action by the Board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Practical Difficulties. Provided all of the foregoing requirements
of the subsection A are satisfied, the Board shall have the power to authorize,
in any zoning district, exceptions to any setback area, length, width, height,
yard, size or projection limitations or to the minimum required number of off-
street parking or loading spaces; provided such an exception may be granted
only where:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Such exception does not exceed 50 percent of the particular
limitation or number in question; or such exception is from a yard requirement
to permit an addition to an existing legal nonconforming building, and such
addition extends no further into the required yard than the existing building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The exception relates entirely to a use classified by applicable
district regulations as either a principal permitted use, a permitted accessory
use, a permitted sign, or to off-street parking or loading areas accessory to
such a permitted use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The exception is reasonably necessary due to practical
difficulties related to the land in question that prohibit the use of the
subject property in a manner reasonably similar to that of other property in
the same district, including, but not limited to, exceptional narrowness,
shallowness or shape of the subject property, exceptional topographical
conditions, location of public utilities or public improvements on or adjacent
to the subject property, or other extraordinary or exceptional situation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Such practical difficulties cannot be overcome by any feasible
alternative means other than an exception.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The exception is in harmony with the essential character of the
neighborhood of the land in question.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Variances; Conditions Governing Applications and Procedures. To hear
and decide requests for variances under the terms of these regulations, to
decide such questions as are involved in determining whether variances should
be granted, to grant variances with such restrictions and conditions as are
appropriate under these regulations, and to deny variances when not in harmony
with the purpose and intent of these regulations. A variance shall not be
granted by the Board unless and until the following requirements are satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application and Hearing Procedures. The following procedures shall
apply to all requests for variances before the Board:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A written application for a variance must be submitted stating
the grounds upon which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notice shall be given at least seven days in advance of a public
hearing on the application by posting notice in a conspicuous place at Cumming
City Hall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear and
participate at the public hearing, either in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In granting any application for a variance, the Board shall set
forth its decision in writing, and the written decision shall contain findings
of fact in support of the decision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A $100.00 non-refundable application fee shall accompany each
application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Required Findings. The Board may grant a variance from the terms of
these regulations only if the Board determines that the applicant has
established that the subject property was acquired in good faith and where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of the property, or
where by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary
or exceptional situation, the strict application of the terms of these
regulations actually prohibits the use of the subject property in a manner
reasonably similar to that of other property in the same district, and where
the Board is satisfied under the evidence before it that a literal enforcement
of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship,
and so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed and substantial
justice done. To establish unnecessary hardship, a property owner must show all
of the following elements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return from any
use permitted by the regulations of the district in which the land is located.
Failure to yield a reasonable return may only be shown by proof that the owner
has been deprived of all beneficial or productive use of land in question. It
is not sufficient merely to show that the value of the land has been
depreciated by the regulations or that a variance would permit the owner to
maintain a more profitable use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances not of
the ownerâ€™s own making, which unique circumstances must relate specifically to
the land in question and to general conditions in the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the
essential character of the locality of the land in question.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Conditions to Authorization. In granting any variance, the Board may
prescribe such restrictions and conditions with respect to the permitted use as
the Board deems reasonable to further the objectives of these regulations.
Violations of such restrictions and conditions, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of these
regulations. Except as specifically provided in a decision by the Board to
grant a variance, the permitted use shall conform to all applicable regulations
of the district or districts in which it is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Reversion. If the use authorized under an approved variance is not
initiated within one year of approval of the variance, or if the use authorized
under an approved variance is discontinued or abandoned for a continuous period
of one year, then the right to maintain or continue the variance shall
terminate by operation of law without any further action by the Board.
165.43 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Â Â Â  In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may, so long as such
action is in conformity with the terms of these regulations reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have powers of the
administrative official from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of
three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the administrative official, or to
decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in application of this
chapter.
165.44 APPEALS FROM THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Â Â Â  Any person or any board, taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the City
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may seek review by a Court of Record of
such decision, in the manner provided by the laws of the State and particularly
by Chapter 414, Code of Iowa.
165.45 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Â Â Â  The regulations imposed and the districts created by this chapter may be
amended from time to time by the Council, but such amendments shall not be made
without public hearing before the Council and after a report has been made upon
the amendment by the Commission. At least seven daysâ€™ notice of the time and
place of such hearing shall be posted as required by Code of Iowa. In case the
Commission does not approve the change or, in the case of a protest filed with
the Council against a change in district boundaries signed by the owners of 20
percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed
change, or of those immediately adjacent thereto and within the 200 feet of the
boundaries thereof, such amendment shall not be passed except by the favorable
vote of three-fourths of all members of the Council. Amendments need only refer
to the legally described land involved and need not refer to the Code section
to be valid. Such referral to only the legal description will not invalidate
the map or this chapter other than to change the zoning of the land described.
165.46 APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Â Â Â  Any person may submit to the Council an application requesting a change in
the zoning district boundaries as shown on the official zoning district map.
Such application shall be filed with the Clerk, accompanied by a fee of $150.00
plus $10.00 an acre plus $3.00 per notification letter, and shall contain the
following information:

zoning classification requested for the property.

property.

applicant feels the present zoning classification is no longer valid.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Plat Required. A plat showing the locations, dimensions, and use of the
applicantâ€™s property and all property within 200 feet thereof including
streets, alleys, railroads and other physical features. All fees shall be
deposited to the general revenue fund of the City. Failure to approve the
requested change shall not be deemed cause to refund the fee to the applicant.
165.47 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
Â Â Â The requirements and regulations of this section shall apply to any
development or redevelopment of/and within the City.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Statement of Intent. It is the intent of this section to prevent
traffic congestion and to provide for proper traffic safety by preserving the
public thoroughfares for the unimpaired movement of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic. Therefore, it is recognized that the requirements of this section are
minimum and that in certain uses of land, these requirements may be inadequate.
Where review of the site plans and intended land use indicate through the

166.01 ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS. Â 
Â Â Â The requirements, guidelines, and standards set forth in this chapter shall
apply to any development or redevelopment of property within the zoning
districts listed and within the City.
166.02 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
Â Â Â  In the interest of promoting the general welfare of the community and to
protect the value of buildings and property, the image and character of a
community is considered important. It is recognized that the community should
be visually attractive as well as economically prosperous and the manner in
which a use is accomplished is as important as the use itself. It is the intent
of these architectural standards to establish basic parameters for building
design that when followed have the effect of producing structures that preserve
and enhance building and property values, are long-lasting, resistant to
deterioration, and maintain their visual appeal over time. It is further the
intent of these standards to establish and promote a community image of
permanence, quality, authenticity, and consistency through building design. It
is not the intent of these standards to unduly restrict design freedom or apply
a particular architectural style to all structures.
166.03 ARCHITECTURAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

the actions of the applicant;

properties in the same district and the terms of these sign regulations;

170.12 MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â  The improvements set forth in this section shall be considered the minimum
improvements necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Streets. The subdivider of land being subdivided shall provide the
grading of the entire street right-of-way, alley or public place and provide
appropriate PCC paving, including curb and gutter on all streets to the plat
boundary. All streets or alleys shall be of such width and shall be so
constructed as to meet the standards of the City. Under some circumstances the
City may require, as a condition for approval of the plat, dedication and
improvement of a street having a width greater than outlined in Section
170.22 of this chapter or a thickness greater than that outlined in the design
standards to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
City street system as it relates to both the area being platted and other
areas. In such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost
of improving the wider and/or thicker street and the street width and/or
thickness reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the subdivision taken
alone. The streets shall, upon final observation, approval and acceptance by
the City, become the property of the City. The developer may be responsible for
all or a portion of the cost of paving of adjoining unpaved street.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Sanitary Sewer System. The subdivider of the land being platted shall
make adequate provision for the disposal of sanitary sewage from the platted
area with due regard being given to present or reasonably foreseeable needs.
There shall be constructed, at the subdividerâ€™s expense, a sanitary sewer
system including all necessary pumping stations, pumping equipment, manholes
and all other necessary or desirable appurtenances to provide for the discharge
of sanitary sewage from all lots or parcels of land within the platted area to
a connection with the City's sanitary sewers. Mains shall be extended to plat
boundary where extension will be needed. The sanitary sewer system shall be
constructed in accordance with the current City Standards and at the sewer
grades approved by the City. Under some circumstances the City may require, as
a condition of approval of the plat, installation of a sanitary sewer that is
larger than necessary to complete the City sanitary sewer system as it relates
to both the area being platted and other areas. In such event, the City will
pay the subdivider the difference in cost of pipe and installation between the
larger sewer and the diameter of sewer reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs
of the area. The above-mentioned facilities for the collection and disposal of
sanitary sewage from the platted area shall, upon final observation, approval
and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Storm Sewer System. The subdivider of land being platted shall install
and construct a storm sewer system adequate to serve the area, including
anticipated extension of use to serve additional areas. Mains shall be extended
to plat boundary where extension will be needed. The storm sewer system shall
be constructed in accordance with the current City Standards and at sewer
grades approved by the City. Under some circumstances the City may require, as
a condition of approval of the plat, installation of a storm sewer system that
is larger than necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary
to complete the City storm sewer system as it relates to both the area being
platted and other areas. In such event, the City will pay the subdivider the
difference in cost of pipe and installation between the larger sewer and the
diameter of sewer reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area. The
sewers shall, upon final observation, approval and acceptance by the City,
become the property of the City. In the storm sewer design phase, consideration
shall be given to alternatives and principles of storm water management or the
provisions of a storm water management plan if such plan has been adopted by
the City.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Water Main System. The subdivider of land being platted shall install
and construct a water main system to adequately serve all lots or parcels of
land within the platted area, with due regard to the present and reasonably
foreseeable needs of the entire area, and shall connect the same to the City's
existing water mains. Mains shall be extended to plat boundary where extension
will be needed. The water mains and appurtenances system shall be constructed
in accordance with the current City Standards. All water lines shall be at
least eight inches in diameter and looped as may be required by the City. Under
some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for approval of the
plat, installation of a water main that is larger than necessary to complete
the City water distribution system as it relates to both the area being platted
and other areas. In such event the City will pay the subdivider the difference
in cost of pipe and installation between the larger water main and the diameter
of water main reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area. The water
mains shall, upon final observation, approval and acceptance by the City,
become the property of the City.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Sidewalks. The developer of land shall install sidewalks to current
City Standards with a minimum width of four feet and provide appropriate PCC
paving with a depth as to meet the standards of the City, at his or her expense
where the fronts, rears or sides of lots front an existing or platted street
adjacent to or within the proposed plat as well as within parks and open spaces
as directed by the City. The sidewalk shall be extended to the park or open
space boundary through the developable subdivided areas to a proposed or
existing street right-of-way as directed by the City. Each individual lot
developer contained within the subdivision plat shall install all other
sidewalks within the subdivision as required by this Code of Ordinances. As a
condition for approval of the plat, installation of a sidewalk wider than four
feet may be necessary to complete the City Trails system as it relates to both
the area being platted and other areas. In such event the City will pay the
subdivider or developer the cost of the additional sidewalk width above the
required four- foot minimum. The sidewalks shall, upon final observation,
approval and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City. All work
shall be completed prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Street Lighting. The subdivider of land being platted shall, at his or
her expense, provide for street lighting. The subdivider shall coordinate with
the necessary agencies to provide such lighting and shall submit to the City,
for review and approval, a plan consistent with the current edition of the Iowa
Statewide Urban Design Standards for Public Improvements, as amended by the
City. The street lighting shall, upon final observation, approval and
acceptance by the City, become the responsibility of the City.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Electrical/Telecommunication Service. The subdivider of land being
platted shall, at his or her expense, provide for underground electrical/
telecommunication service in a joint utility box track to the land being
platted and each of its parcels contained therein. The subdivider shall
coordinate with the necessary agencies to provide such service in accordance
with the controlling agencies' regulations and requirements.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Street Signs and Traffic Signalization. The subdivider of land being
platted shall, at his or her expense, provide for signage and installation of
permanent street and traffic control signs consistent with the Cityâ€™s
standards. In the event the land being platted directly results in the need for
traffic signalization, the proportion of traffic directly attributed to the
proposed subdivision and contributing to the need of such signalization shall
be included in the subdivision plat at the subdividerâ€™s expense. The portion of
the traffic contributing to the need for traffic signalization as a result of
existing conditions prior to the proposed subdivision shall be at the Cityâ€™s
expense. The traffic signalization shall, upon final observation, approval and
acceptance by the City, become the property of the City.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Fire Hydrants. The subdivider of land being platted shall install and
connect to the waterworks system fire hydrants as required by the Council. Fire
hydrants shall be located in accordance with current City Standards. In no
instance shall a hydrant be located farther than 300 feet from any structure.
The type of fire hydrant shall be determined by the City Engineer.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Subsurface Drainage. The subdivider of land shall install a collector
storm sewer line designed to carry water from residential sump pumps to a
public storm sewer system or other acceptable drainage-way in accordance with
City Standards and to take into consideration volume of flows, soil conditions,
etc. The storm sewer lines running within the street right-of-way shall be
owned by the City. The lines running from a residence and connecting to the
City storm sewer system shall be privately owned.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Sump Pump Lines. It is a petty misdemeanor for any owner, occupant or
user of any premises to direct into or allow any storm water, surface water,
ground water, well water or water from industrial or commercial air
conditioning systems to drain into the sanitary sewer system of the City. No
rain spout or other form of surface drainage and no foundation drainage or sump
pump shall be connected or discharged into any sanitary sewer. A sump pump and
rigid pipe discharge connection to the outside shall be required for all
construction in new subdivisions when it is determined necessary by authorized
City personnel to protect sanitary sewer infiltration. The authorized City
personnel shall conduct his or her analysis and make his or her determination
of soil conditions on a subdivision basis. The sump pump and rigid pipe
discharge requirement will apply to all units constructed within a specific
subdivision.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Studies. The subdivider and/or developer of land shall be responsible
for improvements or studies that the City and/or County Engineer deems
necessary because of the impact of their development on the surrounding area.
170.13 EASEMENTS REQUIRED.
Â Â Â  The subdivider shall grant easements to the City and utility companies as
required for providing utility services to the subdivision as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Public Utilities. Where alleys are not provided, or where otherwise
required by the present or future placement of public utilities, easements of
not less than 20 feet in width shall be granted by the owner along rear and
front, and where necessary, alongside lot lines for public utility
requirements. Except where prohibited by topography, such easements shall be
centered on lot lines. Easements of greater width may be required along lot
lines, or across lots when necessary for the placement and maintenance of
utilities. No buildings or structures, except as necessary for utilities, shall
be permitted on such easements.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Easements Along Streams and Watercourses. Wherever any stream or
surface watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided or
developed, the subdivider/land developer shall, at his or her own expense, make
adequate provisions for the proper drainage of surface water and shall provide
and dedicate to the City an easement along said stream or watercourse as
necessary for the proper maintenance of the watercourse and as provided by the
City.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Sidewalks. Where sidewalks are required to be extended from street
right-of- way to parks and open spaces, the subdivider shall dedicate to the
City a platted out-lot for said sidewalk with sufficient width as necessary for
proper maintenance of the sidewalks.
170.14 MAINTENANCE BOND REQUIRED.
Â Â Â  The owner and subdivider of the land being platted shall be required to
provide to the City proper maintenance bonds, satisfactory to the City, so as
to ensure that for a period of four years from the date of final acceptance of
any improvement the owner and subdivider shall be responsible to maintain such
improvement in good repair.
170.15 ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS FOR SEWER OR WATER.
Â Â Â  Where connection to the City sewer or water system cannot reasonably be
made, the City may approve alternate facilities for the distribution of water
or the collection and disposal of sanitary wastes. Such alternate systems shall
be designed to fully protect the public health, safety and welfare, and shall
meet all requirements of State, County or other applicable health regulations.
Prior to granting approval of such alternate systems, the City shall require
that the owner and subdivider provide to the City a waiver of assessment
protest or such other legally binding documents necessary to protect the City
from the expense of the subsequent installation of sewer or water facilities.
170.16 DEFERRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â  Where the subdivision is located outside but within two miles of the City
limits, the construction of public improvements within the subdivision may be
deferred at the option of the City provided that the subdivider furnish to the
City a written waiver authorizing the City to install specified public
improvements within the subdivision and recover the full cost thereof by
special assessment procedures in the event the subdivision should be annexed to
the City.
170.17 MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
Â Â Â  The standards set forth in this chapter shall be considered the minimum
standards necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
The minimum improvements outlined in this chapter shall be designed in
accordance with the current edition of the Iowa Statewide Urban Design
Standards for Public Improvements.
170.18 LAND SUITABILITY.
Â Â Â  No land shall be subdivided which is found to be unsuitable for subdividing
by reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage, adverse soil conditions, adverse
geological formations, unsatisfactory topography or other conditions likely to
be harmful to the public health, safety or general welfare, unless such
unsuitable conditions are connected to the satisfaction of the City. If land is
found to be unsuitable for subdivision for any of the reasons cited in this
section, the Council shall state its reasons in writing and afford the
subdivider an opportunity to present data regarding such unsuitability.
Thereafter, the Council may reaffirm, modify or withdraw its determination
regarding such unsuitability.
170.19 LANDS SUBJECT TO FLOODING.
Â Â Â  No subdivision containing land located in a floodway or a flood hazard area
shall be approved by the City without the approval of the Iowa Natural
Resources Council. No lot shall be located so as to include land located within
a floodway or flood hazard area unless the lot is of such size and shape that
it will contain a buildable area not within the floodway or flood hazard area
suitable for development as allowed by
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances for the zone in which the lot is
located. Land located within a flood hazard area or floodway may be included
within a plat as follows, subject to the approval of the City:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Included within individual lots in the subdivision, subject to the
limitations of this section;
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Preserved as open space for recreation use by all owners of lots in the

Â Â Â  In addition to the standards set forth in this chapter, all minimum
improvements outlined in this chapter shall be constructed in accordance with
the current edition of the Iowa Statewide Urban Standard Specifications for
Public Improvements. The City Engineer shall from time to time prepare, and the
Council shall from time to time adopt by resolution, technical standards for
public improvements amending the Iowa Statewide Urban Standard Specifications
for Public Improvements. Such technical standards for public improvements shall
contain the minimum acceptable specifications for the construction of public
improvements. Such technical standards may vary for classes of improvements,
giving due regard to the classification of streets or other improvements, and

by the Council by resolution, such technical standards for public improvements
shall have such force and effect as if they were fully set forth in this
section.
170.22 STREET STANDARDS.
Â Â Â  The following standards shall apply to all streets to be located within the
subdivision:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Streets shall provide for the continuation of major streets from
adjoining platted areas, and the extension of major streets into adjoining
unplatted areas. Where a plat encompasses the location for a major street
proposed in the comprehensive plan or major street plan the plat shall provide
for such major street.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Street grades shall align to existing streets, and all grades for
streets shall be as approved by the City.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Arterial streets shall be located so as to not require direct access
from the arterial street to abutting lots.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Street right-of-way widths and pavement widths shall be as specified in
the comprehensive plan, major streets plan or technical standards for public
improvements.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Half streets are prohibited, except where an existing platted half
street abuts the subdivision; a platted half street to complete the street
shall be required.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Minor streets should be designed to discourage through traffic while
safely connecting to major collector or arterial streets.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Street jogs with centerline offset of less than 150 feet are
prohibited, except where topography or other physical conditions make such jogs
unavoidable.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible and no
street shall intersect any other street at less than 70 degrees.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â At intersections of major streets, and otherwise as necessary, lot
corners abutting the intersection shall be rounded with a radius sufficient to
provide necessary space within the right-of-way for sidewalks, traffic control
devices and other necessary improvements without encroachment onto the corner
lots.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Dead-end streets are prohibited, except where a street is planned to
continue past the subdividerâ€™s property. A dead end may be allowed, provided a
hard-surfaced HMA or PCC turnaround (a â€œbulbâ€ or â€œhammerheadâ€) is constructed
and removed upon subsequent development.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Cul-de-Sac. When a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be no
longer than 600 feet in length for office, commercial, industrial and multiple-
family residential land uses, and no longer than 800 feet within residential
subdivisions with lots for detached single- family dwellings. A maximum of 30
single-family detached units will be permitted access to a cul-de-sac street.
The closed end of a cul-de-sac shall have a circular turnaround having a
diameter of 114 feet of right-of-way and paved roadway diameter of 90 feet in
residential subdivisions. The circular turnaround of a cul-de-sac in a
commercial or industrial subdivision shall have a diameter of 114 feet of
right-of-way and 90 feet of roadway pavement. The right-of-way width of the
street leading to the cul-de-sac turnaround in all subdivisions shall have a
minimum of 60 feet in width and the lead-in portion of the street to the
circular turnaround shall be rounded at a radius of not less than 50 feet.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys are prohibited.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels,
such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and
opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for
adequate utility connections for such resubdivision. Easements for the future
openings and extensions for such streets or utilities may, at the discretion of
the City, be made a requirement of the plat.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Streets which are or will become extensions of existing streets shall
be given the same name of the existing streets. New street names shall not be
the same or sound similar to existing street names. All street names shall be
at the approval of the City.
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â The City may approve a private street where unusual conditions make a
private street desirable, provided adequate covenants or other legal documents
ensure that the City will not have to assume any maintenance or other
responsibility for such street.
Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â The width of the right-of-way and paved surface for streets within a
subdivision shall be determined by the Council upon recommendation of the
Commission. The minimum width of right-of-way and paved surface for streets

use by pedestrians.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The size and shape of blocks or lots intended for commercial or
industrial use shall be adequate to provide for the use intended and to meet
the parking, loading and other requirements for such uses contained in
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide
satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and surrounding
land uses.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The size and shape of all lots shall comply with all requirements of
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances for the zone in which the lot is
located.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The front of all lots shall abut a public street, or upon an approved

straight line between the two front lot corners.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Unless unavoidable, lots shall not front on or have direct access to
arterial or major collector streets. Where unavoidable, lots shall be so
arranged as to minimize the number of access points. Commercial and multi-
family development along Highway G14/Cumming Avenue shall use group access
points on adjacent streets.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â All lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or
radial to curved street lines, except where, in the judgment of the City, a
variation to this provision will provide a better street and lot layout.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Corner lots shall have sufficient extra width to permit the required
front yard setback as specified in
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances, oriented to either street.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Reversed frontage lots are prohibited. Double frontage lots shall only

is proposed, the owner and subdivider shall schedule a pre- application
conference with the City. The conference shall be attended by such City or
utility representatives as deemed desirable, and by the owner and the ownerâ€™s
engineer and/or planner, as deemed desirable. The purpose of such conference
shall be to acquaint the City with the proposed subdivision, and to acquaint

and City Engineer for review, prior to incurring significant costs preparing
the preliminary or final plat.
170.26 CLASSIFICATION AND PLAT DETERMINATION.
Â Â Â  Prior to or during the initial discussion with the owner or subdivider, the

subdivider of the procedure for application submission and review. The Zoning
Administrator during initial contact and subsequent meetings with the owner or
subdivider shall compile a list of items requested by the owner or subdivider
to be modified, altered or waived regarding this chapter. Those items detailed
in this chapter, which have no direct application to the proposed subdivision

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The divided portion added to an adjacent developed lot to allow
a building expansion or the addition of a new accessory building on said lot,
which will provide adequate setback or conformance to other requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The divided portion added to an adjacent conforming developed or
undeveloped lot to expand the area of the said lot and allow the future
subdivision of the expanded lot.

Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The City Clerk, upon receipt of 20 copies of the final plat shall file
one copy in the records of the City, shall retain one copy for public
inspection and shall forward the remaining copies to the Zoning Administrator.
Sheet size shall be at least 22 inches by 34 inches. In addition, at least one
11-inch by 17-inch submittal that is reproducible shall be filed with the City.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Zoning Administrator shall provide copies of the plat to the City
Engineer and such other persons as are necessary to review the plat and shall
schedule the plat for review by the City Council.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The Zoning Administrator and the City Engineer shall examine the plat
as to its compliance with the ordinances and standards of the City and its
conformance with the preliminary plat and shall set forth their findings in
writing. A copy of the findings shall be provided to the subdivider and the
Planning and Zoning Commission for review prior to review by the Council. The
Commission shall then review the plat and shall forward a written
recommendation thereon to the Council within 45 days of the filing of the plat
with the Clerk. If the recommendation is to disapprove the plat or to require
modification of the plat, the reasons therefor shall be set forth in writing
and a copy of the recommendation shall be provided to the subdivider. Five
copies of the corrected plat shall be due within 30 days of Council action.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Upon receipt of the plat and written reports thereon, the Council shall
review the plat and attachments thereto. If the plat is found to conform to the
ordinances and standards of the City and the comprehensive plan and other
adopted plans, all as of the date of approval of the preliminary plat and is
found to substantially conform to the preliminary plat, the Council shall
approve the plat, and shall cause its approval to be entered on the plat as
required by law.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Action on the final plat by the Council shall be taken within 60 days
of the date of filing of the plat with the Clerk, unless such time period is
extended by agreement between the subdivider and the City. If the action is to
disapprove the plat, the reasons therefor shall be set forth in the official
records of the Council and such decision shall be provided to the subdivider.
170.37 VARIANCES.
Â Â Â  Where, in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown
that strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider, because of unusual topography and
other conditions, the Council may vary, modify or waive the requirements so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided,
however, such variance, modification or waiver shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any
variance or modification be more than minimum easing of the requirements as
necessary to eliminate the hardship. In granting a variance, the Council may
impose such additional conditions as are necessary to secure substantially the
objectives of the requirements so varied, modified or waived.
170.38 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Â Â Â  This chapter or any provision of this chapter may be changed or amended
from time to time by the City Council, provided, however, that such changes or
amendments shall not become effective until after a public hearing has been
held, public notice of which shall have been published at least once, not less
than seven or more than 20 days before the date of the hearing.
170.39 LIMITATION OF PROVISIONS. Â 
Â Â Â Nothing contained in this chapter shall serve to abrogate, limit, repeal or
otherwise modify any other ordinance or regulation except as expressly set
forth in this chapter. If any provision of this chapter conflicts with the
provisions of any other ordinance, regulation or statute, the more restrictive
shall apply.
