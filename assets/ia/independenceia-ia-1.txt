or injunctive relief.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[8])

penalties are also provided for the violation. Nor does it preclude or limit

for a period of five years. The exemption shall also apply to the acquisition
of or improvement to machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant

   A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior approval
for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the City Council
resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new
construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such
prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the
new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)
8.08 EXEMPTION REPEALED.

the leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated
to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal and cleanup of hazardous
substance spills within the City limits.
36.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance

listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03 CLEANUP REQUIRED.
   Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection,
dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the
hazardous substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the
environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including
ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied
by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City Manager may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable
notice, based on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting
a deadline for accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed
to procure cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs
associated with the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the
deadline. In the event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is
necessary as a result of the present danger to the public health, safety and
welfare, then no notice shall be required and the City may proceed to procure
the cleanup and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with the
cleanup. If the bill for those services is not paid within 30 days, the City
Attorney shall proceed to obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the

of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources

46.01 CURFEW.
   The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating
to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room that is not designed, set aside,
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
   2.   Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon
any of the alleys, streets or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. of the
following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday and between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 5:00 a.m. on Friday and
Saturday.
   3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
      A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
      B.   The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or
on either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible
for the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
      C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
         (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation
in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within
one hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
         (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
         (3)   Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
         (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end
or before the beginning of the activity;
         (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or
meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious
or cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
      D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail or
personal service, provide to the adult responsible for the minor, written
notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will
result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance against both the responsible
adult and minor, with applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
      D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
46.02 CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
   It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to smoke, use, possess,
purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by a person under 18 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if said person possesses the tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part of the person’s
employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a valid permit
under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for sale or sells

benefited property under State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.13)
   8.   Failure to Abate. Any person causing or maintaining a nuisance who
shall fail or refuse to abate or remove the same within the reasonable time

Ordinances.
 
Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
4 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

   A vehicle owner may contest an Automated Traffic Citation by submitting a
written challenge to the citation or requesting that a municipal infraction be
filed pursuant to Iowa Code §364.22. Any such written challenge or request must
be on a form specified by and available from the City as indicated on the

Offset Program administered by the Department of Administrative Services, State
Accounting Enterprise. Notwithstanding the City’s right to file a municipal
infraction, the City may first seek voluntary payment of the fine by sending a
written request for payment to the vehicle owner and/or referring the matter to
a private service agent to conduct collection in accordance with all applicable
law.

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain
multiple listings of abandoned vehicles but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed

   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

the SFD has been correctly applied to a property. Following this review, any
customer who believes the provisions of this chapter have been applied in error
may appeal in the following manner:
   1.   An appeal must be filed in writing to the City of Independence City
Manager and include all necessary information to support the request for an
appeal.
   2.   In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include
official property information, including site characteristics for the property
in questions.
   3.   Using the information provided by the appellant, the City Manager shall
conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the
appeal in writing within thirty (30) days.
   4.   In response to an appeal, the City Manager may adjust the stormwater
service charge applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose
and intent of this chapter.
   5.   A decision by the City Manager which is adverse to an appellant may be

101.10 EXEMPTION FROM FEES; SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
   The stormwater management fee shall not apply:
   1.   If a written request is made, in special conditions the City Manager of
the City of Independence may grant fee payment and collection variances after
determining that granting the variance would be in the City’s best interest,
will improve efficiency, safety and is practical. Upon the granting of any
variance, the City Manager shall file notice with the City Council giving
reason(s) for the variance.
   2.   The fee established in Subsection 101.08 for nonresidential properties
recognizes that these types of development are required to provide stormwater
detention and water quality treatment onsite. Having such stormwater
management, therefore, is not a basis for exemption. However, property owners
may qualify for a reduction to their SFD provided they fulfill stormwater
management requirements and perform stormwater facility inspections and
maintenance as determined by the Stormwater Utility Credit Program.
101.11 STORMWATER SERVICE BILLING.
   1.   All stormwater management fees shall be due and payable under the same
terms and conditions provided for payment of a combined service account as
contained in Section 92.04 of this Code of Ordinances. Water services may be
discontinued in accordance with the provisions contained in Section 92.05 if
the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions contained
in Section 92.06 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a
delinquent account.
   2.   Stormwater fee billing will begin upon water meter installation.
101.12 ANNUAL REVIEW OF RATES.
   While the intent of the City Council is to maintain the initial rates until
fiscal year 2024, the City has the option to review the stormwater service
charges at least yearly and revise the stormwater service changes as necessary
to ensure that such charges as herein established and specified generate
adequate revenues to pay the costs of maintenance and operation (including
replacement and debt service) of a stormwater management system and facilities
and that the stormwater service charges continue to provide for the
proportional distribution of maintenance and operation costs (including
replacement costs and debt service) for a stormwater management system and
facilities among the users and user classes. The liability of a stormwater
service user to pay for charges as provided in this chapter shall not be
contingent, however, upon any such review or revision.

avenues, alleys and public places to serve customers within and without the
City, and to furnish and sell natural gas to the City and its inhabitants. For
the term of this franchise the Company is granted the right of eminent domain,

   The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa or as subsequently amended or
changed.
110.03 PIPES AND MAINS.
   The Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the
purpose of laying, re-laying, repairing or extending gas pipes, mains, conduits
and other facilities provided that the same shall be so placed as not to
interfere with the construction of any water pipes, drain or sewer or the flow
of water therefrom, which have been or may hereafter be located by authority of
the City.
110.04 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements
(whether titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in
accordance with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on tile with and made

(“Tariff”), at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in, on, over or under any public street or alley in the
City in such a manner as the City may reasonably require for the purposes of
facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the
street or alley. If the City has a reasonable alternative route for the street,
alley or public improvements or an alternative construction method, which would
not cause the relocation of the Company installations, the City shall select
said alternative route or construction method. The City shall be responsible
for surveying and staking the right-of-way for City projects that require the
Company to relocate Company facilities. If requested the City shall provide, at
no cost to the Company, copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross-
section drawings. If tree removals must be completed by the City as part of the
City’s project and are necessary whether or not utility facilities must be
relocated, the City at its own cost shall be responsible for said removals. If
the timing of the tree removals does not coincide with the Company facilities
relocation schedule and Company must remove trees that are included in the
City’s portion of the project, the City shall either remove the trees at its
cost or reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred to remove said trees.

relocation of utility facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds
and provide them to the Company to compensate the Company for the costs of
relocation.
110.05 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places for
the installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the surface,
restoring it to the condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current City
code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right of way, sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent
to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate previously
existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously existing
condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to comply
with City, State or federal rules, regulations or laws.
110.06 UTILITY EASEMENTS.  
   Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide Company with not
less than 60 days’ advance notice of the City’s proposed action and, upon
request grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,

   Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by this
franchise, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in order to directly or indirectly facilitate the
project of a commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, City
shall reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-public entity to
reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to
relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order to
facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all
claims, suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or
damage to any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the
Company’s negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify
and save harmless the City for any costs or damages arising from the negligence
of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
110.10 INFORMATION.  
   Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right of way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right of way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“Information”). The
Company and City recognize the Information may in whole or part be considered a
confidential record under State or federal law or both. Therefore, the City
shall not release any Information without prior consent of the Company and
shall return the Information to Company upon request. City recognizes that
Company claims the Information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by State or federal law on other grounds and
agrees to retain the Information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps or information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, and
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended

   All reasonable and proper police regulations shall be adopted and enforced
by the City for the protection of the facilities of the Company.
110.14 FRANCHISE FEE.  
   A franchise fee is imposed upon, and shall be collected from, the natural
gas customers of the Company receiving service and located within the corporate
limits of the City. The franchise fee shall be imposed from each customer as
set forth below upon the gross receipts, minus uncollectible accounts, derived
from the delivery and sale of natural gas to customers within the corporate
limits of the City and distribution service. City imposes franchise fees as set
out on the Fines and Fees Schedule in Section 1.15 of this Code of Ordinances.
110.15 FEE EXEMPTIONS.  
   The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt customer classes of sales from
imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease or eliminate the franchise
fee. The City reserves the right to cancel any or all the franchise fee
exemptions and also reserves the right to grant exemptions to customer classes
in compliance with Iowa law and Section
110.17 of this chapter. The City does therefore exempt the customer classes in
Section
110.14 from paying franchise fees. Customer classes exempted by the City at
time of imposing a franchise fee percentage greater than zero (0) percent:
110.16 COLLECTION OF FEES.  
   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following 90 days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the franchise fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes
subject to or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide
the information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the
Company. The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a
list of premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of
the City.
110.17 IDENTIFYING CUSTOMERS.  
   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes
subject to or exempt from paying the City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall
be solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
110.18 MODIFYING FEES.  
   The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in
any 24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers,
increasing, decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee shall become
effective, and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon
date which is not less than 60 days following written notice to the Company by
certified mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such new
ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the City Council.
110.19 INDEMNIFICATION.  
   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising out
of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In
addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from
any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified,
by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a
different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.
110.20 FEE REMITTANCE.  
   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
quarter as follows:
   January, February and March
   April, May and June
   July, August and September, and
   October, November and December
   MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of
any changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
110.21 FEE ADMINISTRATION.  
   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
110.22 FEE REFUNDS.  
   MidAmerican Energy Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to
return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City
customers and remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to
provide data or information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise
fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or
calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the
City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to
provide such data or information.
110.23 OBLIGATION TO COLLECT.  
   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is
modified or repealed if:
   1.   Any other person is authorized to sell natural gas at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate;
   2.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural gas at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of natural gas within the City; or
   3.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final non-appealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this ordinance can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
110.24 OBLIGATION RELIEVED.  
   The other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   1.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
   2.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   3.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
110.25 MANAGEMENT FEES.  
   Upon implementation of a franchise fee the City shall not, pursuant to
Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or charge Company right of way
management fees for permits for Company construction, maintenance, repairs,
excavation, pavement cutting or inspections of Company work sites and projects
or related matters.
110.26 TERMINATION.  
   Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for
cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching
party may terminate this franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in
breach of this franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal
law. A party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise if the
alleged breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other
party.

111.02 GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
   1.   Grant. The City hereby grants to the Grantee a renewal of its
nonexclusive franchise which authorizes the Grantee to construct and operate a
cable system in, along, among, upon, across, above, over, under, or in any
manner connected with public ways within the service area, and for that purpose
to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain, or retain
in, on, over, under, upon, across, or along any public way such facilities and

transmission and distribution of cable services, data services, information and
other communications services or for any other lawful purposes.
   2.   Other Ordinances. The Grantee agrees to comply with the terms of any
lawfully adopted generally applicable local ordinance, to the extent that the
provisions of the ordinance do not have the effect of limiting the benefits or
expanding the obligations of the Grantee that are granted by this chapter.
Neither party may unilaterally alter the material rights and obligations set
forth in this chapter. In the event of a conflict between any ordinance and
this chapter, this chapter shall control.
   3.   Other Authorizations. The City shall not permit any person to provide

service area and shall not be on terms and conditions more favorable or less

authorization than those which are set forth herein. In any renewal of the
franchise, the City, should it seek to impose increased obligations upon the
Grantee, must take into account any additional franchises or authorizations
previously granted and find that the proposed increased obligations in the
renewal are not more burdensome and/or less favorable than those contained in
any such additional franchises or authorizations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this provision shall not require the City to grant a franchise to a
municipally owned telecommunications utility.
111.03 STANDARDS OF SERVICE.
   1.   Conditions of Occupancy. The cable system installed by the Grantee
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be located so as to cause a minimum of
interference with the proper use of public ways and with the rights and
reasonable convenience of property owners who own property that adjoins any of
such public ways.
   2.   Restoration of Public Ways. If during the course of the Grantee’s
construction, operation, or maintenance of the cable system there occurs a
disturbance of any public way by the Grantee, Grantee shall replace and restore
such public way to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the
public way existing immediately prior to such disturbance.
   3.   Relocation for the City. Upon its receipt of reasonable advance written
notice, to be not less than 10 business days, the Grantee shall protect,
support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the
public way, any property of the Grantee when lawfully required by the City by
reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and
street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of
sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of public structures or
improvements. The Grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of
its property except in the case of aerial facilities.
   4.   Relocation for a Third Party. The Grantee shall, on the request of any
person holding a lawful permit issued by the City, protect, support, raise,
lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way as
necessary any property of the Grantee, provided: (i) the expense of such is
paid by said person benefiting from the relocation, including, if required by
the Grantee, making such payment in advance; and (ii) the Grantee is given
reasonable advance written notice to prepare for such changes. For purposes of
this subsection, “reasonable advance written notice” shall be no less than 30
business days in the event of a temporary relocation, and no less than 120 days
for a permanent relocation.
   5.   Trimming of Trees and Shrubbery. The Grantee shall have the authority
to trim trees or other natural growth in order to access and maintain the cable
system. Such trimming shall be conducted by properly trained personnel with a
proof of certification upon a minimum of 10 days’ advance notice to the City.
   6.   Safety Requirements. Construction, operation, and maintenance of the
cable system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such
work shall be performed in substantial accordance with generally applicable
federal, State, and local regulations and the National Electric Safety Code.
   7.   Underground Construction. In those areas of the service area where all
of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are
underground, the Grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain its
cable system underground. Nothing contained in this subsection shall require
the Grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted
appurtenances.
   8.   Notice of Development. The City agrees to provide notice to Grantee of
platting process for new subdivisions consistent with the same process for
other users of the public way.
   9.   Required Extensions of the Cable System. Grantee agrees to provide
cable service to all residences in the service area subject to the density
requirements specified in this subsection. Whenever the Grantee receives a
request for cable service from a potential subscriber in an unserved area
contiguous to Grantee’s existing distribution facilities where there are at
least 10 residences within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable
mile) from the portion of the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable which is to
be extended, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to
said subscribers for the cable system extension, other than the published
standard/non-standard installation fees charged to all subscribers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the service area
where another operator is providing cable service, into any annexed area which
is not contiguous to the present service area of the Grantee, or into any area
which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary
circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.
   10.   Subscriber Charges for Extensions of the Cable System. No subscriber
shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the
density requirements of Subsection 9 above, the Grantee shall only be required
to extend the cable system to subscribers in that area if the subscribers are
willing to share the capital costs of extending the cable system. Specifically,
the Grantee shall contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost
per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of
residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet from the Grantee’s trunk or
distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 10 actual or potential
subscribers. Subscribers who request service hereunder shall bear the remaining
cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require
that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such
potential subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible
for any standard/non-standard installation charges to extend the cable system
from the tap to the residence.
   11.   Cable Service to Public Buildings. The Grantee, upon request, shall
provide without charge, a standard installation and one outlet of basic cable
service to those administrative buildings owned and occupied by the City, fire
stations, police stations, and K-12 public schools that are passed by its cable
system. The cable service provided shall not be distributed beyond the
originally installed outlet without authorization from the Grantee. The cable
service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes, and such outlets
shall not be located in areas open to the public. The City shall take
reasonable precautions to prevent any inappropriate use of the Grantee’s cable
system or any loss or damage to Grantee’s cable system. The City shall hold the
Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the
provision and use of cable service required by this subsection. The Grantee
shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a non-
standard installation is required, unless the City or building owner/occupant
agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary cable system extension and/
or non-standard installation. If additional outlets of basic cable service are
provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the usual
installation and service fees associated therewith.
   12.   Reimbursement of Costs. If funds are available to any person using the
public way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the
City shall reimburse the Grantee in the same manner in which other persons
affected by the requirement are reimbursed. If the funds are controlled by
another governmental entity, the City may upon request of the Grantee make
application for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.
111.04 REGULATION BY THE CITY.
   1.   Franchise Fee.
      A.   The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of three percent
of annual gross revenues (as defined in this chapter). In accordance with the
Cable Act, the 12-month period applicable under the franchise for the
computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year. The franchise fee
payment shall be due semiannually and payable within 90 days after June 30 and
December 31 of each respective period. Each payment shall be accompanied by a
brief report prepared by a representative of the Grantee showing the basis for
the computation.
      B.   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for
recovery by the City of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five years
from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due to the City.
   2.   Rates and Charges. The City may regulate rates for the provision of
basic cable service and equipment as expressly permitted by federal law.
   3.   Renewal of Franchise. The City and the Grantee agree that any
proceedings undertaken by the City that relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s
franchise shall be governed by and comply with the renewal provisions of
federal law.
   4.   Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of the Grantee’s
franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City
either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions
lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party,
any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to
the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act.
   5.   Transfer of Franchise. The Grantee’s right, title, or interest in the
franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered,
other than to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the Grantee, without prior written notice to the City. No such notice
shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other
hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the
Grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness.
111.05 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   The Grantee agrees that the City, upon 30 days’ written notice to the
Grantee and no more than once annually may review such of its books and records
at the Grantee’s business office, during normal business hours and on a
nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the
terms of this franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the
subsection of the franchise that is under review so that the Grantee may
organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the City.
Alternatively, if the books and records are not easily accessible at the local
office of the Grantee, the Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the
reasonable travel costs of the City’s representative to view the books and
records at the appropriate location. The Grantee shall not be required to
maintain any books and records for franchise compliance purposes longer than
three years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Grantee shall not be required to disclose information that it reasonably deems
to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of
any affiliate which is not providing cable service in the service area. The
City agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential
and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that
have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee
shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section
631 of the Cable Act.
111.06 INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION.
   1.   Insurance Requirements. The Grantee shall maintain insurance in full
force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the
franchise. The City shall be designated as an additional insured and such
insurance shall be non-cancellable except upon 30 days’ prior written notice to
the City. The Grantee shall provide a certificate of insurance showing evidence
of the coverage required by this subsection.
   2.   Indemnification. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold
harmless, and defend the City, its officers, boards and employees, from and
against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting
from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise
out of the Grantee’s construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable
system in the service area provided that the City shall give the Grantee
written notice of its obligation to indemnify the City within 30 days of
receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify the City for any damages, liability
or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of the City.
111.07 ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   1.   Notice of Violation. In the event that the City believes that the
Grantee has not complied with the any material term of the franchise, the City
shall informally discuss the matter with Grantee. If these discussions do not
lead to resolution of the problem, the City shall notify the Grantee in writing
of the exact nature of such alleged noncompliance.
   2.   The Grantee’s Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have 30 days
from receipt of the notice described in Subsection 1: (i) to respond to the
City, contesting the assertion of such noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such
default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of such default, it cannot
be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such
default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date
that they will be completed.
   3.   Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in Subsection 1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Subsection 2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within
30 days or the date projected pursuant to Subsection 2 above, if it intends to
continue its investigation into the default, then the City shall schedule a
public hearing. The City shall provide the Grantee at least 10 days prior
written notice of such hearing, which specifies the time, place and purpose of
such hearing, and provide the Grantee the opportunity to be heard.
   4.   Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and State law, in the event
the City, after the hearing set forth in Subsection 3, determines that the
Grantee is in material default of any provision of the franchise, the City may:
      A.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief; or
      B.   In the case of repeated or ongoing substantial noncompliance with a
material term or terms of the franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in
accordance with Subsection 5.
   5.   Revocation. Should the City seek to revoke the franchise after
following the procedures set forth in Subsections 1-4 above, the City shall
give written notice to the Grantee of its intent. The notice shall set forth
the exact nature of the repeated or ongoing substantial noncompliance with a
material term or terms of the franchise. The Grantee shall have 90 days from
such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection.
In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response from the
Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public hearing. The
City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least 30 days prior to such
public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing
and stating its intent to revoke the franchise. At the designated hearing,
Grantee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full participation, including
the right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant evidence,
to require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant testimony of the
officials, agents, employees or consultants of the City, to compel the
testimony of other persons as permitted by law, and to question witnesses. A
complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such hearing.   
Following the hearing, the City shall determine whether or not the franchise
shall be revoked. If the City determines that the franchise shall be revoked,
the City shall promptly provide Grantee with its decision in writing. The
Grantee may appeal such determination of the City to an appropriate court which
shall have the power to review the decision of the City de novo. Grantee shall
be entitled to such relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal must be
taken within 60 days of Grantee’s receipt of the determination of the City. The
City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems
appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of
revocation of the franchise.
   6.   Force Majeure. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in
noncompliance with, the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement
or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or
alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the
ability of the Grantee to anticipate and control.
111.08 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   1.   Actions of Parties. In any action by the City or the Grantee that is
mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a
reasonable, expeditious, and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where
approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   2.   Entire Agreement. The franchise constitutes the entire agreement
between the Grantee and the City and supersedes all other prior understandings
and agreements oral or written. Any amendments to the franchise shall be
mutually agreed to in writing by the parties.
   3.   Reservation of Rights. Acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
franchise will not constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a waiver, either
expressly or impliedly, by Grantee of any constitutional or legal right which
it may have or may be determined to have, either by subsequent legislation or
court decisions. The City acknowledges that Grantee reserves all of its rights
under applicable federal and State Constitutions and laws.
   4.   Notice. Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every
notice or response required by this chapter to be served upon the City or the
Grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the
required party when placed in a properly sealed and correctly addressed
envelope: (i) upon receipt when hand delivered with receipt/acknowledgment;
(ii) upon receipt when sent certified, registered mail; (iii) within five
business days after having been posted in the regular mail; or (iv) the next
business day if sent by express mail or overnight air courier.
   The City and the Grantee shall designate addresses from time to time by
giving notice to the other in the manner provided for in this subsection.

112.02 PLACEMENT NOT TO INTERFERE.
   The poles, lines, wires, circuits, and other appurtenances shall be placed
and maintained so as not to unnecessarily interfere with the travel on said
streets, alleys, and public places in said City or unnecessarily interfere with
the proper use of the same, including ordinary drainage, or with the sewers,
underground pipe, and other property of the City, and the said Company, its
successors and assigns shall hold the City free and harmless from all damages
to the extent arising from the negligent acts or omissions of the Company in
the erection or maintenance of said system.
112.03 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making any excavations in any street, alley, or public place, Company,
its successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in progress by
guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of the
streets, and shall back fill all openings in such manner as to prevent settling
or depressions in surface, pavement or sidewalk of such excavations with same
materials, restoring the condition as nearly as practical. The Company shall
not be required to restore or modify public right of way, sidewalks or other
areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its

112.04 EXISTING FACILITIES.
   The Company shall, at its cost, locate and relocate its existing facilities

such a manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for the purposes
of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the
street or alley or any public improvement thereof, in or about any such street
or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such
improvement. If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its
existing facilities or equipment for any reason other than as specified above,
or as the result of the initial request of a commercial or private developer,
the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocating its existing facilities or equipment. The City shall
consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works projects so as
not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable additional expense in
exercising its authority under this section. The City shall also provide a
reasonable alternative location for the Company’s facilities as part of its
relocation request. Prior to the City abandoning or vacating any street,
avenue, alley or public ground where the Company has electric facilities, the
City shall grant the Company a utility easement for said facilities. If the
City fails to grant the Company a utility easement for said facilities prior to
abandoning or vacating a street, avenue, alley or public place, the City shall
at its cost and expense obtain easements for existing Company facilities. The
Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right of way that have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City in the previous 10 years.

Company. The pruning and removal of trees shall be performed in accordance with
Company’s then current line clearance vegetation plan as filed and approved by
the Iowa Utilities Board, as well as all applicable codes and standards
referenced therein.

is reasonably possible.
112.09 FRANCHISE FEE BILLING.

112.11 FRANCHISE FEE COLLECTION.
   The Company will commence collecting franchise fees on or before the first
Company billing cycle of the first calendar month following 90 days of receipt

revenue purpose statement, City’s list of City utility accounts exempt per Iowa
law from the franchise fee, signed nondisclosure agreement pertaining to the
protection of the confidentiality of utility service address information
provided by the Company to the City, and the City’s verified utility customer
service address list.
112.12 FRANCHISE FEE ADMINISTRATION COST.
   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and the City and Company agree that the Company
may only charge such administrative fees as are provided for in State statutes.
112.13 ANNEXATION.
   Upon receipt of a final and unappealable order or approval authorizing
annexation, or changes in the corporate limits of said City, the City Clerk
shall provide written notification by certified mail to an officer of Company
of such annexation or change in the limits of said City, and the Company shall
apply the franchise fee to its customers who are affected by the annexation or
change in the corporate limits of the City, commencing on an agreed upon date
which is not less than 90 days from receipt of the information required of the
City to implement the franchise fee. The Company shall have no obligation to
collect franchise fees from customers in any annexed area until and unless the
following have all been provided to the Company by certified mail: such final
and unappealable orders or approvals, the City’s list of City utility accounts
exempt from the franchise fee in the annexed area, and the City’s verified
utility customer service address list for the annexed area.
112.14 INDEMNIFICATION.

by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being exempt from the
imposition of franchise fees.
112.15 FRANCHISE FEE REMITTED.
   The Company shall remit franchise fee receipts to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
calendar year quarter. Company shall notify City at least 30 days in advance of
any changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
112.16 NOTICE.
   The City shall give the Company a minimum six-month notice prior to the
request to implement any adjustment in the percentage of franchise fee to be
collected pursuant to Section
112.09 hereof. The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed
only once in any 24-month period. When any such ordinance increasing,
decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee shall become effective,
billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon date which is
not less than 90 days following written notice to the Company by certified
mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such new percentage unless
and until it determines that it has received appropriate official documentation
of final action by the Council. In no event may the percentage of franchise fee
exceed the statutory amount authorized by Iowa law.
112.17 RESPONSIBILITY FOR USE.
   The City shall be solely responsible for the proper use of any amounts
collected as franchise fees, and shall only use such fees as collected for a
purpose as allowed by applicable law.
112.18 REFUND OF FEE.
   The Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and
remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of customers or individual customers, the
City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to
provide such data or information.
112.19 TERMINATION OF COLLECTION.
   Collection of the franchise fee shall cease at the earlier of the
modification or repeal of the franchise fee or the end of the franchise term.
   1.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is
modified if:
      A.   Any other person is authorized to sell electricity to customers
within the corporate limits of the City and the City imposes a franchise fee or
its lawful equivalent at zero or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter,
in which case the obligation of Company to collect and remit franchise fee
shall be modified to zero or the lesser rate; or
      B.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation
and is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
electricity to consumers within the additional territory, in which case the
franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the additional
territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being paid by any
other retail seller of electricity within the City; or
      C.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation, or any Iowa court
issues a final judicial decision regarding franchise fees, or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final non-appealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this chapter can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
   2.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is
repealed, effective as of the date specified below with no liability therefor,
if:
      A.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee
is ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date
of such ruling or as may be specified by that Court; or
      B.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly; or
      C.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or any successor agency, denies the
Company the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such
denial is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
the final agency order from which the appeal is taken.
112.20 NO OTHER FEE FOR USE.
   The franchise fee shall be in lieu of any other payments to the City for the
Company's use of streets, alleys and public places in the said City and other
administrative or regulatory costs with regard to said franchise; and said
poles, lines, wires, conduits and other appurtenances for the distribution of
electric current along, under and upon the streets, alleys and public places in
the said City to supply individuals, corporations, communities, and
municipalities both inside and outside of said City with electric light, heat
and power shall be exempt from any special tax, assessment, license or rental
charge during the entire term of the franchise.
112.21 NO RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT FEE.
   The City shall not, pursuant to Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose
or charge right-of-way management fees upon the Company or fees for permits for
Company construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation, pavement cutting or
inspections of Company work sites and projects or related matters.
112.22 TERM.
   The term of the franchise and the rights granted thereunder shall continue
for the period of 25 years from and after its acceptance by the said Company,
as herein provided.
112.23 MODIFICATIONS.

Company and the City with respect to the rights contained herein, and may not
be superseded, modified, or otherwise amended without the written approval and
acceptance of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
City enact any ordinance or place any limitations, either operationally or
through the assessment of fees other than those approved and accepted by the
Company within this chapter, that create additional burdens upon the Company,
or which delay utility operations.

113.01   INTRODUCTION AND GRANT.
   There is hereby granted to the Company the right and franchise to acquire,
construct, reconstruct, erect, maintain, operate and remove in the City a
transmission system for electric power and the right to erect and maintain the
necessary poles, lines, wires, conduits, and other appliances, equipment and
substations for the transmission of electric current and telecommunications
(collectively, the “Facilities”) along, under and upon the streets, avenues,
alleys and public places in the City; also the right to erect and maintain upon
the streets, avenues, alleys and public places, transmission lines through the
City to interconnect generation, transmission and distribution companies both
inside and outside of said City for the period of twenty-five (25) years, after
which such period the franchise shall expire. However, the City of Independence
shall retain the right to terminate this right and franchise effective at the
end of the tenth (10th), fifteenth (15th), and twentieth (20th) year
anniversary of the Anniversary Date as defined within. In order to exercise
this right to terminate the right and franchise granted to the Company, the
City of Independence must give written notice to the Company no later than six
(6) months prior to expiration of the respective Anniversary Date. The
Anniversary Date shall be the date this franchise is published following
signature by the Mayor. The Company is also granted the right of eminent domain
as provided in Section 364.2 of the Code of Iowa, as amended, or pursuant to
any other statutory authority granted through the City during the term of this
franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and limited to the exercise of
eminent domain related to the construction of facilities to transmit
electricity from generator to substations for distribution in the public right
of way, Company agrees to provide thirty (30) days written notice to the City
prior to exercising such right.
113.02   INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Company shall indemnify, defend and hold City harmless from and against
any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, cost and expenses, but excluding
consequential or indirect damages), judgements, liabilities and causes of
action of any nature whatsoever resulting from its negligent acts or omissions
in the use or occupancy of the streets, avenues, alleys and public ways in the
City, Company’s default of a material term of this franchise, or arising in any
manner out of the negligent acts or omissions of its agents, employees, or
contractors in connection with same, or with respect to the violation of any
laws, including without limitation, any environmental laws. The Company shall
indemnify and defend City for, from and against any and all mechanics’ liens
and other liens and encumbrances filed by any person claiming by, through or
under the Company and against all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by City in connection with any
such lien or encumbrance or any action or proceeding brought thereon. Company’s
obligation to indemnify City hereunder in all instances is conditioned upon the
City providing prompt written notice of any claim(s) upon which it seeks or
will seek indemnification with sufficient detail to allow defense, such as to
not prejudice Company’s ability to defend itself and/or the City.
   The Company shall maintain commercial general liability insurance coverage,
or its equivalent, throughout the term of this franchise. Such insurance shall
be comprehensive in nature, including, but not limited to contractual
liability. In addition, such insurance shall contain limits not less than
$1,000,000 combined single-limit for bodily injury and property damage.
Company’s failure to meet this insurance requirement shall not relieve Company
of its responsibilities under this franchise. Company may self-insure the
coverages indicated herein. Company shall provide City with certificates of
insurance or letter of self-insurance upon request.
   The requirements of indemnification shall not be a waiver of any right that
the City would have to assert defenses on its own behalf under State or federal
law. City shall raise all such defenses and avail Company of all information
necessary to assert such defenses. Company will be subrogated to such defenses
to the extent allowed at law. The Company’s indemnification obligations under
this franchise shall survive the expiration, cancellation, or termination of
this franchise in accordance with applicable statutes of limitation in force
within the State of Iowa.
   The Facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily
interfere with the travel on the streets, avenues, alleys, and public places in
the City nor unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of the same, including
ordinary drainage, or with the sewers, underground pipe and other property of
the City, and the Company shall hold the City free and harmless from all
damages arising from the negligent acts or omissions of the Company in the
erection or maintenance of the transmission system.
113.03   RELOCATION.
   Except as provided herein below, the Company shall, at its cost and expense,
locate and relocate its Facilities in, on or over any public street or alley in
the City in such a manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for
the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or
repair of the street or alley or any public improvement of, in or about any
such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any
such improvement. If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its
Facilities or equipment as the result of a request from a private developer or
other nonpublic entity, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such
relocation as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or
equipment. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its
public works projects so as to not arbitrarily cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this section. The City
shall also provide a reasonable alternate location for the Company’s facilities
and equipment. The City shall give the Company reasonable advance written
notice to vacate a public right-of-way. Vacating a public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
Facilities until the reasonable cost of relocating the same are paid to the
Company, and the City shall utilize reasonable efforts to assist Company in
securing an easement or other continued rights of record to continue to operate
and maintain its facilities upon such relocation.
113.04   MODERN SYSTEM.
   The system authorized by this ordinance shall be of sufficient capacity to
supply all reasonable demands of said City and its inhabitants thereof and kept
in an operable condition consistent with good utility practice and the
reliability standards of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).
113.05   SYSTEM PLANS.
   The Company recognizes the importance of community input when siting new
projects to serve the community and electricity distribution as well as the
authority of the City to permit an otherwise regulate siting activity. The
Company will apply to the City for a permit for work performed in City rights-
of-way in accordance with City regulations and provide project-specific
mapping, which may be protected under Iowa’s open meetings and open records
laws, Iowa Code Chapters 21 and 22, to be used solely and exclusively by the
City in administering the use and occupancy of the public right-of-way and not
otherwise to be relied upon for any purpose.
   At the request of the City, mapping information will be reviewed with the
City staff. All such reviews will be in compliance with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission regulations or the regulations of other agencies with
authority over the review and dissemination of critical infrastructure
information and infrastructure security, and subject to all protective
provisions for critical infrastructure under Iowa’s open meetings and open
records laws, Iowa Code Chapters 21 and 22. Prior to any excavating in the
rights-of-way, both parties shall follow the procedures set forth in Iowa Code
Chapter 480 or an entity with a similar function utilized by both the City and
the Company, currently the Iowa One Call System.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company operations staff will, at the request
of the City, attend an annual meeting with City Public Works staff, utility
staff and other interested City entities to discuss utility reliability
standards, including comparisons to regional and national reliability
statistics, annual and long-term construction planning for the Company and
City, vegetation management and other related items. The Company will, at the
request of the City, participate in one emergency training event. The Company
will maintain a direct phone connection with Independence Police Dispatch or
other emergency contact as determined by the City for emergency communications
as updated at each annual meeting. This will not replace any periodic meetings
needed on specific projects and issues.
   For emergencies, the Company may proceed with the work without first
applying for a permit, provided, however, that the Company shall apply for and
obtain a permit as soon as commercially practicable after commencing such work.
113.06   VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.
   To promote public safety in proximity to its Facilities and equipment and to
maintain electric reliability, the Company is authorized and empowered to
remove, cut, trim, destroy, or otherwise control any tree, shrub, brush, bush
or any parts thereof located within or extending into any street, alley, right-
of-way or public grounds. The foregoing vegetation management shall be
completed in accordance with the most current nationally accepted safety and
utility industry standards, as revised and updated from time to time.
113.07   CONTINUOUS SERVICE.
   Service to be rendered by the Company under this franchise shall be
continuous unless prevented from doing so by fire, Acts of God, unavoidable
accidents or casualties, customer outages or interruptions on the bulk electric
system to no fault of Company or interruptions necessary to properly service
the Company’s equipment, and in such event service shall be resumed as quickly
as is commercially practicable.
113.08   NON-EXCLUSIVITY.
   The franchise granted by this ordinance shall not be exclusive.
113.09   UNDERGROUNDING.
   The City may request estimates for the undergrounding of replacement lines,
upgrades or new lines, including lines to be adjusted for road moves or for
other specific projects addressed at the annual planning meeting, as referenced
in
Section 113.05. When requested, the Company will provide to the City two
estimates: 1) an estimate for the cost of the project with overhead
construction, and 2) an estimate for the cost of the project with underground
construction. The City will have no more than 60 days from the estimate date to
determine if it wants the line built overhead or placed underground. If the
City chooses underground construction for such project, the City will be
responsible for the incremental cost of undergrounding, if and to the extent,
such costs are not already part of or included in a precondition payment for
relocation pursuant to
Section 113.03. The incremental cost of undergrounding is defined as the
differential between the estimate for underground construction and the estimate
for overhead construction. Upon receipt of the City’s payment for the
incremental cost of undergrounding, the Company will install the underground
facilities. The Company reserves the right to bill City for the amount that the
incremental cost associated with installation exceeds its estimate. The City
reserves the right to a refund of overpayment if the incremental costs are less
than the amount billed in the estimate. If the City wishes to have a line not
scheduled for replacement or upgrade placed underground, the City shall contact
the Company to make such a request. The City shall cover all costs related to
this work. If undergrounding of transmission lines requires entities
interconnecting with the Company to make adjustments to their electrical
systems, the City bears the responsibility of communication with those entities
and, if it chooses, the cost of converting their facilities from overhead to
underground. The Company reserves the right to review all the City’s
communications with the affected entities.
113.10   SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, provision, or part of this ordinance shall be adjudged to be
invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of
the ordinance as a whole or any section, provision, or part thereof not
adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.
113.11   TERM OF AGREEMENT.
   The term of the franchise granted by this ordinance and the rights granted
thereunder shall continue for the period of twenty-five (25) years, subject to
a right of cancellation at the end of the tenth (10th), fifteenth (15th), and
twentieth (20th) year following the “Anniversary Date” hereof. †

ordinance is accepted by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the City enact any ordinance or place any limitations, either
operationally or through the assessment of fees, that create additional burdens
upon the Company, or that delay utility operations.
113.17   COMPLIANCE WITH CITY ORDINANCES.
   The Company shall at all times during the term of this franchise ordinance
conform with, submit to, and carry out the provisions of any and all valid
ordinances existing or as hereafter lawfully enacted relating the City’s
exercise of its police powers; provided however, such ordinances do not operate

   In addition to any normal valves on above-ground tanks, there shall be an
extra valve at each pipeline connection to any tank below normal liquid level,
which valve is inside the tank shell and is operated both manually and by an

   The application for a home occupation permit shall contain the name and
address of the applicant; occupation to be conducted in the residence; that the
occupation to be conducted in the residence meets the applicable fire and
safety codes for the new use; and shall be accompanied by an application fee
and an inspection fee as prescribed by resolution of the Council. Any business
service requiring a person to be on premises to receive services such as (but
not limited to) daycares, barbers, beauticians, and any other related business
shall also provide a copy of their State licenses when submitting their
application for a home occupation permit. The inspection fee only shall be
waived for any such businesses submitting proof of inspection by the State.
154.03 PROCEDURE.
   The application shall be presented to the Council and shall contain the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the property owners immediately
adjacent to the property on the east, west, north, and south sides. The City
will notify the adjacent property owners of the intent to consider approving/
denying the application for a home occupancy permit. This will allow the
adjacent property owners the opportunity to either submit their written
comments before the day of the hearing if they are unable to attend the hearing
or attend the hearing and their comments will be heard. The day of the hearing,
the Council shall review the application for approval or denial for a home
occupation permit.
154.04 LIMITATIONS.
   A home occupation shall encompass no more than 30 percent of the habitable
area inside the residence or an adjoining, attached, or unattached enclosed

   A home occupation permit shall be valid for one year and renewed on a yearly
basis within 30 days of the expiration date, by applying to the Council for
renewal and shall be accompanied by a renewal fee as prescribed by resolution
of the Council. Should the home occupation permit not be renewed as required, a
new permit must be applied for and approved before the existing home occupation
may be allowed to continue. Because operating a home occupation in a
residential district is a privilege, a previously approved application may be
revoked upon substantial complaint of the surrounding neighborhood, upon
noncompliance with the required inspections, or upon violation of this chapter
or any ordinance of the City.
154.06 NON-TRANSFERABILITY.
   The home occupation permit shall be valid only for the person at the
residence indicated on the permit and should the occupation be discontinued or
the home sold, the existing permit shall immediately expire. Should the holder
of a valid home occupation permit desire to terminate the home occupation prior
to the renewal date of July 1, said holder shall not receive a refund for any
unexpired time remaining on the permit.
154.07 SIGNAGE.
   A home occupation shall be allowed one sign that is a maximum of three
square feet in area.
154.08 GAINFUL OCCUPATION.
   Any occupation conducted in the residence is considered a gainful occupation
for the purposes of this chapter if either of the following conditions are met:
   1.   As a result of the occupation, the residence is open either to the
public or to nonfamily members of the residents. Family members are considered
parents, siblings, grandparents, nieces and nephews, grandchildren, and
children whose parents or guardians reside in the home.
   2.   As a result of the occupation, any commercial vehicles visit the
residence more than twice per week.
154.09 PENALTIES.

structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of a historic
structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as an historic structure.

167.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its residents.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Independence are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect
and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Independence
and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health,
welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood
losses described in Section 167.02(2)(A) of this ordinance with provisions
designed to:
      A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
167.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Ordinance Apply. The provisions of this ordinance shall
apply to all lands and uses which have significant flood hazards. The Flood

dated December 30th, 2020 which were prepared as part of the Buchanan County
Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas and
all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall be
considered as having significant flood hazards. Where uncertainty exists with
respect to the precise location of the base flood boundary, the location shall
be determined on the basis of the base flood elevation at the particular site
in question. The Flood Insurance Study for Buchanan County is hereby adopted by
reference and is made a part of this ordinance for the purpose of administering
floodplain management regulations.
   2.   Compliance. No structure or land shall be used and no structure shall
be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations which apply
to uses within the jurisdiction of this ordinance.
   3.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
ordinance to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions,
the provision of this ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.

measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance,
prior to the use or occupancy of any structure.
167.05 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   1.   General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine: (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant
will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination. Until a regulatory
floodway is designated, no development may increase the base flood elevation
more than one (1) foot.
Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the
proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the
bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than two (2) square
miles, and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
      A.   All Development. All development within the areas of significant
flood hazard shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
         (4)   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
         (5)   Includes machinery and equipment.
(Subparagraph 5 - Ord. 2022-556 - Sep. 22 Supp.)
      B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of three (3) feet above the base flood elevation.
Construction shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no
lower than 1.0 ft. above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation
at least 18 feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate
methods of elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed
subject to favorable consideration by the City Council, where existing
topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such
cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as
withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new
residential structures located in areas that would become isolated due to
flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this
criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
      C.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of three (3) feet above the base flood elevation, or
together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a
level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in
the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are
adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and
uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the
structure, below the 100-year flood level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevatIon (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are floodproofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator.
      D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
         (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            a.   A minimum of two (2) openings, with positioning on at least
two (2) walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
            b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
         Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access and low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor
and ceiling of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five (5) feet
or more, the applicant shall be required to sign and record with the Buchanan
County Recorder a Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area
remains compliant with the criteria outlined in Section 167.05(1)(D)(1).
         (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (3)   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated or floodproofed to a
minimum of three (3) feet above the base flood elevation.
(Subparagraph 3 - Ord. 2022-556 - Sep. 22 Supp.)
      E.   Factory-Built Homes.
         (1)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of three (3) feet above the base flood elevation.
         (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage
systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
      F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
         (1)   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located
or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
         (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment
facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood
protection equal to or greater than one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than three (3) foot above the base
flood elevation.
         (4)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      G.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of materials and
equipment that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant
life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of three (3) feet above the base
flood elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated
or: (i) not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent
movement due to flood waters; or (ii) be readily removable from the area within
the time available after flood warning.
      H.   Flood Control Structural Works. Flood control structural works such
as levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the
base flood with a minimum of 3 ft. of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      I.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      J.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
ordinance. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five (5) acres or fifty
(50) lots (whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those
areas located within the area of significant flood hazard.
      K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
         (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are
incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 sq. ft. in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than 1 foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-
resistant materials.
            b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
            c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
            d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
            e.   The structure's service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
            f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Section 167.05(1)(D)(1) of this ordinance.
         (2)   Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for
such a structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
coverage of the structure and its contents.
      L.   Recreational Vehicles.
         (1)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of
Section 167.05(1)(E) of this ordinance regarding anchoring and elevation of
factory-built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and,
            b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (2)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of Section 167.05(1)(E) of this ordinance regarding anchoring and elevation of
factory-built homes.
      M.   Pipeline River and Stream Crossings. Pipeline river and stream
crossings shall be buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently
protected to prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
      N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential uses shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the elevation of the 500-
year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations
   2.   Special Floodway Provisions. In addition to the General Floodplain
Standards, development within the floodway must meet the following applicable
standards. The floodway is that portion of the floodplain which must be
protected from developmental encroachment to allow the free flow of flood
waters. Where floodway data has been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no floodway data has been
provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to provide a
floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
      A.   No development shall be permitted in the floodway that would result
in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of
any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an
equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
      B.   All development within the floodway shall:
         (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the
channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any
other drainage facility or system.
      D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles and sanitary and
utility systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable general floodplain
standards and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible
resistance to flood flows.
      E.   Buildings, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
      F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removed from the floodway within the
time available after flood warning.
      G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have more
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
      I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
167.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases
such variances from the terms of this ordinance that will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship.
Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinance and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
ordinance.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this ordinance. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this ordinance.
      E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
167.07 NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this ordinance, but which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, may be continued subject to
the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any
future use of the building premises shall conform to this ordinance.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty
(50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred,
unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude
its continued designation.
167.08 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   Violations of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any
of the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates
this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned for not more than
30 days. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Independence from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
167.09 AMENDMENTS.
   The regulations and standards set forth in this ordinance may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health,
safety and general welfare. Specifically:
   1.   Relationship to Other Public Provisions. These regulations are not
intended to interfere with or to abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or
regulation, statute or other provision of law. Where any provision of these
regulations imposes a restriction different from those imposed by any other
provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or
other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose
higher standards shall control.
   2.   Relationship to Private Provisions. These regulations are not intended
to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or
restriction, provided that where the provisions of these regulations are more
restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement,
covenant or other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these
regulations shall govern.
175.06 ACTION UNDER PRIOR PROVISIONS.
   These regulations do not abate any action now pending under or by virtue of
prior existing subdivision regulations. Nor do they discontinue, abate, modify
or alter any penalty accrued or about to accrue or affect the liability of any
person or waive any right of the City under any section or provision existing
at the time of adoption of these regulations. Nor do they vacate or annul any
rights obtained by any person by lawful action of the City except as expressed
in these regulations.
175.07 EXEMPTION.

the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and install the required improvements or provide a
performance bond.
175.09 PRE-SUBMISSION CONSULTATIONS.
   Prior to the submission of the preliminary plat of any subdivision, the
subdivider is encouraged to meet with the City Engineer and other City
officials responsible for the administration of these regulations to be advised

copy of the preliminary plat to the County Board of Supervisors.
   3.   The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the Commission and City
Engineer to determine its conformity with these regulations and all other
ordinances and regulations in force affecting subdivisions. Copies of the
preliminary plat may be transmitted to other City or school officials, as the
Commission deems necessary, for their recommendations concerning matters within
their jurisdiction. Their recommendations, along with those of the City
Engineer, shall be transmitted to the Commission within three weeks after the
date the plat is filed. The Commission may confer with the subdivider on
changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of such improvements to be
made.
   4.   The developer shall pay associated consulting engineering fees for City
compliance.
175.12 ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
   The Commission, as soon as possible, but not more than 30 days after
receiving the preliminary plat, shall pass upon the preliminary plat as
originally submitted or modified. If the Commission does not act within 30
days, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be approved; provided, however,
the subdivider may agree to an extension of the time period, not to exceed an
additional 60 days. The Commission shall then set forth its recommendations in
writing, whether of approval, modification or disapproval.  
   1.   Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial
changes or modifications are made by the Commission or the Commission
recommends disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it
may request and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the
same manner as the original plat.
   2.   Tentative Approval. If the Commission recommends approval, it shall
express its approval as “tentative approval” and state the conditions of such
approval, if any.
   3.   Documenting Approval. The action of the Commission shall be documented
on seven copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any
conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy
shall be retained by the Commission, and five copies shall be referred to the
Council.
175.13 ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   Within 30 days of its receipt of the preliminary plat, the Council shall, by
resolution, tentatively approve or disapprove the plat. If the preliminary plat
is disapproved, objections to it shall be returned to the Commission for
further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such action. If
approved, the Clerk shall affix his or her signature to five copies of the
preliminary plat with the notation of the date the preliminary plat received
the Council’s tentative approval. One copy shall be returned to the Commission
and three copies shall be returned to the subdivider. The “tentative approval”
by the Council shall not constitute final acceptance of the addition or
subdivision by the City but an authorization to proceed with preparation of the
final plat.
175.14 TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
   The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period
of one year at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained.
Any plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void,
and the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative
approval subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.
175.15 FINAL PLAT.
   The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to
record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms
to all requirements of these regulations.
175.16 REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.
   The following graphic and descriptive material is required to be provided on
the final plat and in the accompanying material.
   1.   Contents of the Final Plat. Every plat of a subdivision offered for
record shall conform to all of the following provisions where applicable:
      A.   The plat shall be a permanent copy or a photographic print made on a
stable plastic film. Exact copies of the plat to be recorded shall be provided
to and filed with the County Recorder, Assessor and Auditor. The original plat
drawing shall remain the property of the registered land surveyor.
      B.   The size of each sheet showing any portion of the subdivided lands
shall not be greater than 18 inches by 24 inches or less than eight and one-
half inches by 11 inches.
      C.   Whenever more than one sheet is used to accurately portray the lands
subdivided, each sheet shall display the number of the sheet and the total
number of sheets included in the plat, as well as clearly labeled match lines
indicating where the other sheets adjoin. An index sheet shall be provided to
show the relationship between the sheets.
      D.   A scale of 100 feet to one inch shall be used. The scale used shall
be clearly stated and graphically illustrated by a bar scale drawn on every
sheet showing any portion of the lands subdivided.
      E.   Subdivisions shall be designated, by name or as otherwise
prescribed, in bold letters inside the margin at the top of each sheet included
in the plat.
      F.   An arrow indicating the northern direction shall be drawn in a
prominent place on each sheet included in the plat, as well as the scale and
date.
      G.   All monuments to be of record shall be adequately described and
clearly identified on the plat. When additional monuments are to be established
subsequent to the recording of the plat, the location of the additional
monuments shall be shown on the plat.
      H.   Sufficient survey data shall be shown to positively describe the
bounds of every lot, block, street, easement or other areas shown on the plat,
as well as the outer boundaries of the subdivided lands.
      I.   All distances shall be shown in feet to the nearest one-hundredth of
a foot, and in accordance with the definition of a foot adopted by the United
States Bureau of Standards. All measurements shall refer to the horizontal
plane.
      J.   The course of every boundary line shown on the plat shall be
indicated by a direct bearing reference or by an angle between the boundary
line and an intersecting line having a shown bearing, except when the boundary
line has an irregular or constantly changing course, as along a body of water,
or when a description of the boundary line is better achieved by measurements
shown at points or intervals along a meander line having a shown course. All
bearings and angles shown shall be given to at least the nearest minute of arc.
      K.   Curve data shall be stated in terms of radius, central angle and
tangent, or length of curve. In all cases, the curve data must be shown for the
line affected.
      L.   The minimum unadjusted acceptable error of closure for all
subdivision boundaries shall be 1:10,000 and shall be 1:5,000 for any
individual lot. The unadjusted error of closure shall be shown on the plat.
      M.   When any lot or portion of the subdivision is bounded by an
irregular line, the major portion of that lot or subdivision shall be enclosed
by a meander line showing complete data with distances along all lines
extending beyond the enclosure to the irregular boundary shown with as much
certainty as can be determined or as “more or less,” if variable. In all cases,
the true boundary shall be clearly indicated on the plat.
      N.   All interior excepted parcels shall be clearly indicated and
labeled, “not a part of this plat.”
      O.   All adjoining properties shall be identified and where such
adjoining properties are a part of a recorded subdivision, the name of that
subdivision shall be shown. If the subdivision platted is a resubdivision of a
part or the whole of a previously recorded subdivision, sufficient ties shall
be shown to controlling lines appearing on the earlier plat to permit an
overlay to be made. Re-subdivisions shall be labeled as such in a subtitle
following the name of the subdivision wherever the name appears on the plat.
      P.   The purpose of any easement shown on the plat shall be clearly
stated and shall be confined to only those easements pertaining to public
utilities including gas, power, telephone, water, sewer and such drainage
easements as are deemed necessary for the orderly development of the land
encompassed within the plat.
      Q.   A strip of land shall not be reserved by the subdivider unless the
land is of sufficient size and shape to be of some practical use or service as
determined by the Council.
      R.   The purpose of all areas dedicated to the public must be clearly
indicated on the plat.
      S.   The plat shall contain a statement by a registered land surveyor
that the plat was prepared by the surveyor or under the surveyor’s direct
personal supervision and shall be signed and dated by the surveyor, and shall
bear the surveyor’s Iowa registration number or seal.
      T.   Street names and clear designation of public alleys.
      U.   Block and lot numbers.
      V.   Name and address of owner and subdivider.
      W.   Accurate dimensions for any property to be dedicated or reserved for
public use.
      X.   The plat shall be signed and acknowledged by the subdivision land

   Upon receipt of the certification by the Commission, the Council shall,
within 60 days, either approve or disapprove the final plat.
   1.   Disapproval of Plat. In the event that said plat is disapproved by the
Council, such disapproval shall be expressed in writing and shall point out
wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
   2.   Acceptance of Plat. In the event that said plat is found to be
acceptable and in accordance with this chapter, the Council shall accept the
same.
   3.   Final Approval and Recording of Plat. The passage of a resolution by
the Council accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting
of the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause
such plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder, and shall file
satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk before the
City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.
175.20 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
   1.   Procedure for Resubdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
   2.   Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the
subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land
and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into
smaller building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel
of land allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of
adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of
such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
175.21 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Council’s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary sewer, water and
other improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the
preliminary plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate the same to
the City, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and
public improvements thus dedicated. Said improvements shall be inspected by the
City Engineer for compliance with designed plans, City ordinances regarding
said improvements, and State law. Before passage of a resolution of acceptance,
the City Engineer shall report to the Council that said improvements meet all
City specifications and ordinances or other City requirements, and the
agreements between the subdivider and the City.
175.22 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation
and dedication of the incomplete portion of required improvements. Final
acceptance of the plat will not constitute final acceptance by the City of any
improvements to be constructed. Improvements will be accepted only after their
construction has been completed. In addition:
   1.   Approved by City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be approved by the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency, and manner of execution and shall be in an amount equal to 125
percent of the anticipated cost of construction of said improvement.
   2.   Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must
be completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat, shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
   3.   Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved
by the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council
an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period
of one additional year. The Council may at any time during the period of such
bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
   4.   Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs
of temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for
the period specified by the Council. Prior to the construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
   5.   Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within
the period specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance
bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within
the terms of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in
default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the
extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in
default.
175.23 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. The
subdivider shall furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the
commencement of any and all construction, and notify the City not less than 48
hours in advance of readiness for required inspections.
175.24 RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND.
   The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:
   1.   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The Council will not accept
dedication of required improvements, or release or reduce a performance bond,
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant’s
engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed “as built”
plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials and other
information required by the City, that all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the subdivision and are in compliance
with City ordinances and State statutes.
   2.   Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the
public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the
plat.
175.25 MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
   1.   Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance. The applicant shall be
required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks until acceptance of said
improvements by the Council. If there are any certificates of occupancy on a
street not dedicated to the City, the City may, on 12 hours’ notice, plow the
street or effect emergency repairs and charge same to applicant.
   2.   Maintenance Bond. The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance
bond with the City prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the
Council, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer and in a form
satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure the satisfactory
condition of the required improvements for a period of four years for the
street pavement and a period of two years for all other improvements after the
date of their acceptance by the Council and dedication of same to the City.
   3.   Maintenance of Unoccupied Subdivision Lots. A developer/owner of any
unoccupied lots upon which no construction has been commenced shall be required
to comply with the following regulations:
      A.   The unoccupied lots shall be level to prevent ponding and to provide
drainage and the lots shall be seeded with a mixture of grass as approved by
the City.
      B.   The unoccupied lots shall be mowed on a regular basis, at least
every two weeks during the growing season.
      C.   Any and all debris, concrete, rocks, scrap building material, junk,
etc. shall be removed and/or placed in approved containers for removal. Timely
removal of all debris shall be required.
      D.   Any and all mud, sand, dirt or debris which is tracked or washed,
either voluntarily or involuntarily onto City streets shall be removed by the
developer, the owner and/or the contractor.
175.26 DEFERRAL OR WAIVER.
   Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
   1.   Waiver of Required Improvements. The Council may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests
of the public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
   2.   Deferral of Required Improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by
the Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein
because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of
connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her
share of the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval
of the final plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said
improvements upon demand of the City.
175.27 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   A certificate of occupancy is hereby required to be issued by the Clerk
prior to sale of any lot by the developer or developer’s agent. No certificate
of occupancy shall be issued until all improvements have been installed,
inspected and approved by the Council.
175.28 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by the
regulations of this chapter in accordance with the specifications and under the
supervision of the Council and to its satisfaction.

subdivision is not in conformance with the above guides or policy and purposes
of these regulations.
175.31 SUBDIVISION NAME.
   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Council, after consultation with the Commission,
shall have the final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which
shall be determined at preliminary plat approval.
175.32 MONUMENTATION.
   Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
   1.   Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments. Prior to the offering of
the plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior
establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the
boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent
control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two permanent
control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided into lots
is less than a block in size, at least two permanent control monuments shall be
established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments shall be
constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and
capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.
The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed
or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the
top of the monument.
   2.   Other Monuments of Record. Other monuments established prior to the
recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be
considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original
permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their
original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded
according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in
subsection 1 of this section.
   3.   Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments. Monuments other than
the permanent control monuments required in Subsection 1 of this section shall
not be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the
conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the registered land surveyor
includes in the surveyor’s statement on the plat that the additional monuments
required by these regulations shall be established before a specified future
date.
   4.   Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be
constructed and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control
monuments prescribed in Subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set in all
of the following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or

standards of these regulations.
      B.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
      C.   All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
      D.   Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
      E.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
      F.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.

for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T or L shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
      B.   Permanent Dead-End Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than 150 feet. However, the Council may require the reservation
of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street in accordance with City construction standards and
specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited
in length in accordance with City construction standards and specifications.
   10.   Sub-drains. Sub-drains shall be required on all streets being
constructed in new subdivisions. The design, location and size of the sub-

pavement with integral curbs and gutters at a minimum thickness of six and one-
half inches. Adequate provisions shall be made for culverts, drains and
bridges. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures,
curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards
and specifications adopted by the City, and shall be incorporated into the
construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
   3.   Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
   4.   Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways were so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
      A.   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth
in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
“This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is
prohibited.”
      B.   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
      C.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
   5.   Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
      A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at
least 100 feet therefrom. No more than two streets shall intersect at any one
point unless specifically approved by the Council.
      B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where
streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
Intersection of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
      C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service
streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a municipal collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
      D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
      E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
      F.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent or less.
   6.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by
the Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of his or her
land developed and so served.
   7.   Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of
all subdividers:
      A.   Alleys shall be prohibited in residential districts.
      B.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
      C.   Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet and a
roadway width of not less than 20 feet.
      D.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
      E.   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
   8.   Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions shall
apply to street dedications and reservations:
      A.   Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to
eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half street is
adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved
and dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter
street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street
right-of-way width within his or her own subdivision boundaries.
      B.   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas
for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets
shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own expense to
the full width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for
any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements
of the zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated to the City in
fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
175.38 STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
   The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
   1.   General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or
flood water run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall
be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block.
   2.   Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
      A.   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions
containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved outfall.
      B.   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually,
as determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangement for future
storm water disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
      C.   A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the
necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction
standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
      D.   The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on
existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision.
City drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. The Council also reserves the right to require storm water retention
if necessary. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
      E.   The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety
or welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to
the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the flood plain of
any stream or drainage course.
   3.   Dedication of Drainage Easements. The following shall apply to the
dedication of drainage easements.
      A.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
      B.   Drainage easements:
         (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
         (2)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
         (3)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.
         (4)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the area requirement of any lot.
175.39 WATER FACILITIES.
   Water facilities shall be provided as follows:
   1.   General Requirements. The following general requirements shall apply to
the provision of water facilities within City limits:
      A.   The City shall provide adequate water mains through the residential
subdivision at no cost to the subdivider. The subdivider shall be solely
responsible for providing adequate water mains through all other subdivisions.
The subdivider shall be solely responsible for the tapping of the main and the
provision of a stop box and/or curb box for each connection within all
subdivisions.
      B.   Water main extensions shall be approved by the City.
      C.   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants and all
water supply improvements shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
   2.   Individual Wells and Central Water Systems. The following requirements
shall apply to the provision of individual wells and central water systems on
lands outside the City limits:
      A.   In the discretion of the Council, if a public water system is not
available, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in
such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to
every lot in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the
appropriate County or State agency for testing, and individual wells and
central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate County or State
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the Council.
      B.   If the Council requires that a connection to a public water main be
eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or central
water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water service at
the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds may be
required to insure compliance.
   3.   Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions
except those coming under Subsection 2 of this section. Fire hydrants shall be
located no more than 600 feet apart and within 300 feet of any structures and
shall be approved by the City.
175.40 SEWAGE FACILITIES.
   Sewage facilities shall be provided as follows:
   1.   General Requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the City construction standards and
specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules,
regulations and standards of the City and the State Department of Natural
Resources or State Department of Public Health. Plans shall be approved by the
above agencies.
   2.   Construction of Sanitary Sewage Systems. Sanitary sewage systems shall
be constructed as follows:
      A.   The subdivider shall install a public sanitary sewage system if the
subdivision is within the City and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the
subdivision.
      B.   If the subdivision is outside the City, and public sanitary sewage
systems are not reasonably accessible but will become available within a
reasonable time, not to exceed 15 years, the applicant may choose one of the
following alternatives:
         (1)   Install a central sewage system, operated and maintained by the
benefited property owners. Where plans for future public sanitary sewage
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains.
         (2)   Individual disposal systems, provided the applicant shall
install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a
point in the subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public
sewer main shall be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the
street line, and a connection shall be available in the home to connect from
the individual disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers
become available. Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready for use and
shall conform to all plans for installation of the public sewer system, where
such exist, and shall be ready for connection to such public sewer main.
      C.   If the subdivision is outside the City and sanitary sewer systems
are not reasonably accessible and will not become available for a period in
excess of 15 years, the applicant shall install individual disposal systems or
central sewage systems.
   3.   Individual Disposal System Requirements. If public sewer facilities are
not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot areas
shall conform to the requirements of applicable zoning regulations and these
regulations. Percolation tests and test holes shall be made as directed by the
City and the results submitted to the local board of health.
   4.   Water Supply Interconnections. There shall be no physical connection
between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer which will
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other water supply
sources and structures.
175.41 SIDEWALKS.
   The following requirements shall apply to the provision of sidewalks:
   1.   Location. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated non-pavement
right-of-way of all streets and shall be located one foot inside the dedicated
right-of-way.
   2.   Construction. Sidewalks shall be improved as required in Subsection 2
of Section 175.37 of this chapter, and shall be constructed of Portland cement
concrete, four feet wide and four inches thick except at driveway locations
where the sidewalk shall be constructed six inches thick. Grade for sidewalks
shall be approved by the City Engineer.
175.42 UTILITIES.
   The following shall apply to the provision of utilities:
   1.   Location. The Council may require that all utility facilities,
including, but not limited to, gas, electric power, telephone and CATV cables,
be located underground through the subdivision. All utility facilities existing
and proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted
lot, including stub-ins, shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the
discretion of the Council, the requirement for service connections to each lot
may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership
and intended to be developed for the same primary use.
   2.   Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
      A.   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for
utilities. Such easements shall be at least 10 feet wide. Proper coordination
shall be established between the subdivider and the applicable utility
companies for the establishment of utility easements established in adjoining
properties.
      B.   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least 10 feet in width shall be provided along side
lot lines with satisfactory access to the street or rear lot lines. Easements
shall be indicated on the plat.
   3.   Maintenance. The subdivider shall attain written confirmation that the
maintenance of all electric infrastructure within the subdivision, including,
but not limited to, street lights, will be the responsibility of the electric
supplier.
175.43 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the
City as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic spots
and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the
subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of
grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been
granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and
all trees where required shall be protected against change of grade.
175.44 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
   1.   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in City plans
and regulations.
   2.   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
      A.   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions
to the types of industrial development anticipated.
      B.   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      C.   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to
street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction.
      D.   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and storm water
drainage.
      E.   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
      F.   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
175.45 SCHOOL AND PARK RESERVATIONS.
   If land to be subdivided contains sites that are designated in City plans or
plans of other public bodies to be used for schools or parks, the developer
shall reserve such site for such use. If sites which have been reserved are not
acquired by the City or other public body within two years of the date of the
preliminary plat approval, then such sites may be subdivided by the developer.
The appropriate public body may release the reserved site sooner by certifying
to the Council that it does not intend to acquire such site within the two-year
period. Each developer shall set aside not less than five percent of the gross
area of all property subdivided in new subdivisions and resubdivisions for
dedication to public use as parks and recreation areas. Such five percent shall
be in addition to the property dedicated for streets, alleys, easements and
other public ways.
175.46 IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTION.
   Improvements in the two-mile unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of
these regulations shall be the same as required herein, except as otherwise
specifically stated, provided they are not less than that required by the
applicable County subdivision regulations, and provided further that all
construction plans shall be approved by the County, and completed public roads
shall be accepted by the Board of Supervisors for public maintenance.
175.47 VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   The following shall apply to the granting of variations and exceptions:
   1.   Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided, the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
      A.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
      B.   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
      C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out.
      D.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property.
   2.   Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
   3.   Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all
of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
175.48 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
   Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice
of which shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments
shall first be submitted to the Commission for study and recommendation before
the hearing is held. The Commission shall forward its recommendations to the
Council within 30 days, after which the Council shall give notice of and hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment.
175.49 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   No plat or subdivision within the City or within two miles thereof shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth, and further:
   1.   Issuance of Building Permits. No more than two building permits for
each separate tract existing at the time of the effective date of these
regulations shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in accordance
with these regulations; except that this provision shall not limit the number
of building permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as defined by
applicable land use regulations such as zoning and restricted residence
regulations or additions or improvements to a main or accessory building
already legally located upon said tract.
   2.   Sale or Lease Without Plat. Any person who shall dispose of or offer
for sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the City, until the plat
thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in these regulations,
shall forfeit and pay the amount shown on the Fines and Fees Schedule in
Section 1.15 of this Code of Ordinances for each lot and part of lot sold or
disposed of, leased or offered for sale.

180.01 INTRODUCTION.
   This chapter shall regulate and restrict the height of structures, objects,
and growth of natural vegetation, as well as land uses, otherwise regulating
the use of property, within the vicinity of the Independence Municipal Airport.
Creation of appropriate zones and establishing the boundaries thereof, as well
as providing for changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones are
vested in this chapter. The Independence Airport Land Use and Height Zoning
Maps are incorporated into and made part of the ordinance codified in this
chapter. This chapter also provides for the enforcement of the Airport
Ordinance, the recognition of Board of Adjustment; and imposition of penalties
related to the implementation of the Airport Ordinance.
180.02 AUTHORITY.
   Code of Iowa Section 329.3, Airport Zoning, empowers local municipalities to
zone airports including height restrictions and land uses.
180.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   1.   The Independence Municipal Airport (hereafter referred to as “the
Airport”) is acknowledged as an essential public facility to the State of Iowa
and the local community. The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is
a public nuisance and poses a potential concern to the surrounding communities
served by the Airport.
   2.   There shall be no creation or establishment of a hazard that endangers
the public health, safety, welfare, and impact an individual’s quality of life,
or prevents the safe movement of aircraft at the Airport. For the protection of
the public health, safety, and general welfare, and for the promotion of the
most appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or
establishment of airport hazards.
   3.   The prevention of airport hazards shall be accomplished, to the extent
legally possible, by proper exercise of the police power. The prevention of new
airport hazards, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or
marking and lighting of existing airport hazards, are considered to be a public
purpose for which the City and County may raise and expend public funds, as an
incident to the operation of airports, to acquire or property interest therein.
180.04 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Airport Ordinance.
180.05 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter encompasses a general area around the Airport. Specific
dimensions associated with the zoning boundary are shown in the Airport Land
Use and Height Zoning Maps.
180.06 DEFINITIONS.
   The following definitions shall be utilized for terms as appropriate to this
chapter.
   1.   “Air traffic” (FAA FAR Sec. 1.1) means aircraft operating in the air or
on an airport surface, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas.
   2.   “Airport” (FAA FAR Sec. 152.3) means any areas of land or water that
are used, or intended for use, for the landing and takeoff of aircraft; any
appurtenant areas that are used, or intended for use, for airport buildings,
other airport facilities, or rights-of-way; and all airport buildings and
facilities located on the areas specified in this definition.
   3.   “Airport elevation” (FAA AC 150/5190-4A) means the highest point on an
airport’s usable landing area measured in feet from sea level.
   4.   “Airport environs” means the land use and people in the areas
surrounding an airport which can be directly affected by the operation of the
airport.
   5.   “Airport hazard” (FAA FAR Sec. 152.3) means any structure or object of
natural growth located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use of
land near a public airport that obstructs the airspace required for the flight
of aircraft landing or taking off at the airport; or is otherwise hazardous to
aircraft landing or taking off at the airport.
   6.   “Airport layout plan” (ALP) (FAA FAR Sec. 152.3) means the plan of an
airport showing the layout of existing and proposed airport facilities.
   7.   “Airport overlay zone” means a zone intended to place additional land
use conditions on land impacted by the airport while retaining the existing
underlying zone. The FAR Part 77 Surfaces and RPZs have been combined to create
five airport overlay zones. The five specific zones create a comprehensive area
focused on maintaining compatible land use around airports.
      A.   Zone A - is intended to provide a clear area that is free of above
ground obstructions and structures. This Zone is closest to the individual
runway ends.
      B.   Zone B - is a critical overlay surface that reflects the approach
and departure areas for each runway at an airport. The size of Zone B is
predicated upon the type of approach (visual, non-precision, or precision) that
a specific runway has and the type/size of aircraft utilizing the runway.
      C.   Zone C - includes those areas that are parallel to the runway
pavement and extend 1,050 feet from the edge of the primary surface.
      D.   Zone D - is typically elliptical in shape, depending upon the runway
types and configurations at an individual airport.
      E.   Zone E - is the outermost zone of the overlay areas and has the
least number of land use restriction considerations. The zone begins at the
edge of the horizontal surface and is 4,000 feet in width paralleling the
horizontal surface.
   8.   “Airport Reference Code” (ARC) is an FAA coding system used to relate

180.07 AIR SPACE OBSTRUCTION ZONES.
   The Airport Land Use and Height Overlay Zoning Districts are illustrated on
the official Independence Airport Land Use and Height Zoning Map, attached to
and made part of the Airport Ordinance. Such official Airport Land Use and
Height Zoning Map may be amended, and all notations, references, elevations,
data, zone boundaries, and other information thereon, are hereby adopted as
part of this chapter.
180.08 LAND USE SAFETY ZONES.
   FAR Part 77 Surfaces and RPZs have been combined to create five airport
overlay zones. These five zones are designed to maintain compatible land uses
around the Airport. The zones shall be evaluated for compatible land uses.
   1.   Definition of Zones. Five airport overlay zoning districts are
prescribed within this chapter. Specific dimensions for the individual zones
for each runway end are noted in the following tables and text. The Airport
Land Use and Height Zoning Maps should be evaluated to determine the specific
area of impact associated with each zone.
      A.   Zone A - Runway Protection Zone (RPZ). Zone A is intended to provide
a clear area that is free of above-ground obstructions and structures. This
zone is closest to the individual runway ends. The dimensional standards for
this zone are the same as those described in the Airport Design AC (AC 150/
5300-13 Change 11) and are shown in the following table.
Table 1: Zone A Dimensional Requirements
 
Runway Ends Approach Visibility Dimensions
            Minimums1           Length     Inner Width Outer Width RPZ Acres
Runway 18   Non-Precision       1,700 feet 1,000 feet  1,510 feet  48.978
Runway 36   Non-Precision       1,700 feet 1,000 feet  1,510 feet  48.978
1.   The RPZ dimensional standards are for the runway end with the specified
approach visibility minimums. The departure RPZ dimensional standards are
equal to or less than the approach RPZ dimensional standards. When an RPZ
begins other than 200 feet beyond the runway end, separate approach and
departure RPZs should be provided. Refer to FAA AC 150/5300-13, Change 11,
Appendix 14 for approach and departure RPZs.
 
Source: FAA AC 150/5300-13, Change 11, Airport Design Standards
      B.   Zone B - Approach Surface. Zone B is a critical airport overlay
zoning surface that reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway
at an airport. The size of Zone B is predicated upon the type of approach
(visual, non-precision, or precision) that a specific runway has and the type/
size of aircraft utilizing the runway. The following table illustrates the
various sizes of Zone B based upon the specific runway criteria. A portion of
Zone B is overlaid by Zone A because the approach surface and RPZ overlap the
entire length of the RPZ.
   Consequently, the length of Zone B begins at the inner edge of the RPZ.
      C.   Zone C - Transitional Surface. Zone C includes those areas that are
parallel to the runway pavement and extend 1,050 feet from the edge of the
primary surface paralleling the runway and extended runway centerline until
they reach the end of Zone A at a 90 degree angle. The specific dimensions for
Zone C are based upon various options for the primary surface that is
predicated upon the type of approach and critical aircraft.
      D.   Zone D - Horizontal Surface. Zone D is typically elliptical in
shape, depending upon the runway types and configurations at individual
airports.
      E.   Zone E - Conical Surface. Zone E is the outermost zone of the
airport overlay zoning areas and has the least number of land use restriction
considerations. The zone begins at the edge of the horizontal surface and is
4,000 feet in width paralleling the horizontal surface.

   2.   Zone Compatibility. The following tables shall be utilized to evaluate
land use compatibility for various land use classifications. Uses identified as
compatible shall not require additional review. However, consideration should
be given to the following areas of concern:
      A.   Noise sensitive related issues.
      B.   High concentrations of people.
      C.   Tall structures.
      D.   Visual obstructions.
      E.   Wildlife and bird attractants.
      F.   Flammable substances and materials.
      G.   Electrical, navigation, and radio interference.
   Uses found to be not compatible shall be precluded from development within
the specific zone. Uses found to require additional review shall be evaluated
for general compatibility utilizing the Compatible Land Use Planning Checklist
and the seven primary areas of concern noted above.

180.09 AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONING MAPS.
   The Airport Land Use and Height Overlay Zoning Districts established by this
chapter are shown on the Airport Land Use and Height Zoning Maps. Such Official
Airport Land Use and Height Zoning Maps may be amended, and all notations,
references, elevations, data, zone boundaries, and other information thereon,
is hereby adopted as part of this chapter.
180.10 ORDINANCE ADMINISTRATION.
   It shall be the duty of the Independence Zoning Administrator and Buchanan
County Zoning Administrator, referred to herein as the “Airport Zoning
Administrator,” within their respective jurisdictions to administer the
regulations prescribed herein for their respective communities. Applications
for permits and variances shall be made to the appropriate Airport Zoning
Administrator upon forms furnished by said Airport Zoning Administrator.
Applications for action by the Board of Adjustment shall be forthwith
transmitted by the Airport Zoning Administrator should an applicant request
review. Permit applications shall be either granted or denied by the
appropriate Airport Zoning Administrator according to the regulations
prescribed herein.
180.11 AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONING PERMITS.
   It shall be the duty of the applicant to provide the Airport Zoning
Administrator with sufficient information to evaluate the proposed action. This
information shall include but not be limited to the following as noted in the
Compatible Land Use Planning Checklist:
   1.   Contact information.
   2.   Structure information.
   3.   Site information.
   4.   Drawing information.
   5.   Certification.
   6.   Identify current and potential compatibility concerns.
   The Airport Zoning Administrator shall evaluate the proposal based upon
information provided by the applicant. The Airport Zoning Administrator shall
approve the permit if after evaluation, the proposed project is found to be
adequately compatible. Should the proposed project be found to be incompatible
after review, the Airport Zoning Administrator shall deny the permit. Should
the permit be denied, the applicant shall have the right to request a variance
or an appeal as prescribed in this chapter.
180.12 HAZARDOUS MARKINGS AND LIGHTING.
   Lighting and marking requirements will be determined through an FAA 7460-
1 airspace analysis. The owner of any structure, object, natural vegetation, or
terrain is hereby required to install, operate, and maintain such markers,
lights, and other aids to navigation necessary to indicate to the aircraft
operators in the vicinity of an airport the presence of an airport hazard.
Hazardous markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at
the expense of the jurisdiction.
180.13 HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   No structure, object, natural vegetation, or terrain shall be erected,
altered, allowed to grow or be maintained within any airport zoning district
established by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height
limitations set forth in this chapter. The permitted height shall not exceed
the difference between the grade elevation and the height limitation numbers
illustrated on the “Official Independence Airport Land Use and Height Map”
within the various airport zoning districts encompassed by this chapter. An FAA
7460-1 airspace review shall provide a portion of the information necessary to
evaluate potential height impacts. However, it shall not be the sole source of
review.
180.14 AIRPORT ZONING COMMISSION.
   The commission so appointed shall be known as the Airport Zoning Commission
and shall make a formal recommendation on all changes to this chapter. In
adopting, amending, and repealing airport zoning regulations, the Council shall
follow the procedure in Code of Iowa Sections 414.4 and 414.6 and the Board of
Supervisors of a county shall follow the procedure in Code of Iowa Sections
335.6 and 335.8. The Airport Zoning Commission shall consist of five total
members, two members from each jurisdiction, selected from each jurisdiction’s
existing planning and zoning commission by the Council, and one additional
member to act as chairperson and to be selected by a majority vote of the
members selected for the Airport Zoning Commission. The terms of the members of
the Airport Zoning Commission shall be for six years excepting that when the
commission is first created, one of the members appointed by each jurisdiction
shall be appointed for a term of two years and one for a term of four years.
Members may be removed for cause by the appointing authority upon written
charges after public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term
of any member whose office becomes vacant in the same manner in which the
member was selected.
180.15 AIRPORT BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   The governing bodies of the jurisdictions under this chapter shall provide
for the appointment of an Airport Board of Adjustment, as provided in Code of
Iowa Section 414.7 for a city, or as provided in Section 335.10 for a county.
The Board of Adjustment has the same powers and duties, and its procedures and
appeals are subject to the same provisions as established in Code of Iowa
Sections 414.9 to 414.19 for a city, or Sections 335.12 to 335.21 for a county.
The Board of Adjustment shall consist of five total members, two members from
each jurisdiction, selected from each jurisdiction’s existing board of
adjustment by the governing body thereof, and one additional member to act as
chairperson to be selected by a majority vote of the members selected for the
Airport Board of Adjustment. The terms of the members of the Board of
Adjustment shall be for five years, excepting that when the board shall be
created, one of the members appointed by each jurisdiction shall be appointed
for a term of two years and one for a term of four years. Vacancies shall be
filled for the unexpired term of any member whose office becomes vacant in the
same manner in which that member was selected. Members shall be removable for
cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and after public
hearing. The concurring vote of a majority of the board shall be necessary to
do any of the following:
   1.   Reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any
administrative official.
   2.   Decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which the board is
required to pass under any regulations adopted pursuant to Code of Iowa Chapter
329.
   3.   Effect any variance from any regulations adopted pursuant to Code of
Iowa Chapter 329.
180.16 VARIANCES.
   Any person desiring to erect, alter, or increase the height of any
structure, object, or to permit the growth of any natural vegetation, or
otherwise use said person’s property in violation with any section of this
chapter, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for variance from such
regulation. No application for variance to the requirements of this chapter may
be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the application has
been submitted to the Airport Zoning Administrator for an opinion as to the
aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Manager does not respond
to the Board of Adjustment within 15 days from receipt of the copy of the
application, the Board may make its decision to grant or deny the variance.
There shall be a non-refundable application fee paid by the applicant, the
amount of which will be set by the jurisdiction in question.
180.17 APPEALS.
   Any person, property owner, or taxpayer impacted by any decision of this
chapter may appeal to the Airport Board of Adjustment. Such appeal, by
application, shall be taken to the Board within a reasonable time, but not
longer than 30 days. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the
Board an application and all documentation constituting the record upon which
the appealed action is requested. In exercising their powers, the Board may, in
conformity with the provisions of the law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as it believes
proper and to that end will have the powers of the Airport Zoning
Administrator. There shall be a non-refundable application fee paid by the
applicant, the amount of which will be set by the jurisdiction in question. The
concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination of the Airport Zoning
Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter which it is
required to pass under this chapter, provided that the action of the Board
shall not become effective until after the written decision or resolution of
the Board, setting forth the full reason for its decision and the vote of each
participating member as documented in its minutes. Said written decision or
resolution shall be filed in the office of the Airport Zoning Administrator and
shall be open to public inspection.
180.18 NONCONFORMITIES.
   Any preexisting nonconforming structure, tree, or use, shall not be
replaced, rebuilt, altered, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, so as to
constitute a greater airport hazard than it was when this chapter or amendments
to it were adopted. A nonconforming structure in existence at the adoption of
the Airport Ordinance that was not lawful, or authorized under previous zoning
ordinances shall not be authorized to continue as a nonconforming building or
structure pursuant to the Airport Ordinance, or amendments thereto. Nothing in
this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition
any part of any building or structure declared unsafe. It is the intent of the
Airport Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are
removed or abandoned, but not to encourage their survival. Further, any
nonconforming structures, buildings, uses, parcels, or lots shall be subject to
the nonconforming regulations of the community in which the property in
question is located.
180.19 JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by any decision of the Board
of Adjustment may appeal to the Court of Record as provided in Code of Iowa
Section 414.15.
180.20 PENALTIES.
   If any building or structure is erected, constructed, altered, repaired,
converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is used in
violation of this chapter, the appropriate City or County may, in addition to
other remedies, seek injunctive relief, commence a municipal or county
infraction action, mandamus, or other appropriate lawful action necessary to
prevent, correct, or abate such violation. A violation of this chapter shall be
deemed a violation of the appropriate City or County Code and thus constitute a
municipal or county infraction, a civil offense punishable by a civil penalty,
order of abatement and the entry of a judgment for costs of abatement or
correction, pursuant to Code of Iowa Section 364.22 or 331.307. Any
construction started without a permit or which does not comply with the
requirements of the corresponding Code of Ordinances shall be removed
immediately. The City Council or County Board of Supervisors may, without
limitation, provide for the abatement of such infraction, and may pursue any
combination of remedies available. Each day that a violation is continued shall
constitute a separate violation.
