be abandoned and removed, where said private sewer is within the limits as
described above, the council may order that the outside water closet, privy or
privy vault be abandoned and such facilities to be connected directly with the
proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The
order of the council may be in substantially the following form:
Be It Resolved by the Council of the City of Knoxville, Iowa:
That it is necessary that the outside closet and privy vault located on the

(1983 Code §
4-5-5)
4-6-6: PRIVATE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:
Where a public sanitary sewer is not available within the limits as set out in
Section
4-6-5 hereof, the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage
disposal system complying with the provisions of the Code of Iowa and the
Marion County Health Department and being licensed by the City. (1983 Code §
4-5-6)
4-6-7: PERMIT:
Before any person shall open, uncover, or in any manner make a connection or
reconnection with or modify any part of the public sewers, he/she must obtain a
written permit from the City. The application for the permit shall be filed on
blanks furnished by the City. The application shall include a description of
the property, the name of the property owner, the amount and date of any prior
assessment for construction of the public sewers, a general description of the
materials to be used and the manner of construction, the line of the building
sewer and the place of connection, if known, the intended use of the sewer, and
name and address of the person who will do the work. The administrative officer
may allow amendments to the application or permit that do not conflict with
this Chapter. The permit shall be issued bearing the date of issuance, if the
proposed work meets all the requirements of this Chapter and if all fees
required under this Chapter have been paid. Work under any permit must be begun
within six (6) months after it is issued. (1983 Code §
4-5-7)
4-6-8: REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
The administrative officer may at any time revoke any permit for any violation
of this Chapter and require that the work be stopped. The owner or plumber may
appeal such action to the City Council in the manner provided in Section
4-6-4 of this Chapter. (1983 Code §
4-5-8; 1996 Code)
4-6-9: FEE FOR PERMIT:
Before any permit is issued, the person who makes application, shall pay one
hundred dollars ($100.00) to the Clerk to cover the cost of issuing the permit

8-10-1985)
4-6-10: SPECIAL CONNECTION CHARGE:
If the property to be connected to a public sewer has not been assessed for any
part of the cost of construction of the public sewers, the owner shall pay a
special connection charge to the City for the use of the public sewers before
the permit is issued. The amount of this fee shall be an equitable portion of
the cost of the public sewers in relation to the benefits received by the
property and the fee shall be established by the City Council. (Ord. 85-6, 8-
19-1985, eff. 9-1-1985)
4-6-11: SEPARATE CONNECTIONS:
In no case shall a joint sewer be allowed where the property abuts on a street,
alley or easement in which there is a public sewer. Other buildings in adjacent
areas which are required to be connected shall be separately and independently
connected to the public sewers unless the City Council in a duly adopted
resolution specifically permits joint connections, in accordance with plans
approved by the Council. (1983 Code §
4-5-11)
4-6-12: GRADE:

4-6-13: EXCAVATIONS:
Excavations to do work under this Chapter shall be dug so as to occasion the
least possible inconvenience to the public and to provide for the passage of
water along the gutter. All such excavations shall have proper barricades at
all times, and warning lights placed from one-half (1/2) hour before sunset to
one-half (1/2) hour after sunrise. In refilling the excavation, the earth must
be laid in layers and each layer tamped thoroughly to prevent settlement, and
this work and any street, sidewalk, pavement or other public property that is
affected, must be restored to as good a condition as it was previous to the
excavation. The plumber must maintain the affected area in good repair to the
satisfaction of the City Council for three (3) months after refilling. No
excavation shall be made within six feet (6') of any laid water pipe while the
ground is frozen and no water or sewer pipe shall be exposed to frost, except
by special written permission of the administrative officer. (1983 Code § 4-5-
13)
4-6-14: MAKING THE CONNECTION:
Any connection with a public sewer must be made under the direct supervision of
the administrative officer or his/her authorized assistant. The connection
shall be made at the property line with that part of the sewer already
extending to the property line. If there is no sewer connection extending from
the public sewer to the property line, the administrative officer shall
supervise a measurement for the location of the "Y" branch in the public sewer.
Excavations shall be made at the point designated by the administrative officer
and if no "Y" branch is found there, then the plumber shall connect directly
with the public sewer at that point, but only with an approved saddle, and no
broken or cut pipe material shall be permitted to remain in the sewer. The
administrative officer may give permission in writing to a property owner to
make a connection at other points if the property owner has shown good reason
for the change. (1983 Code § 4-5-14)
4-6-15: UNLAWFUL DISCHARGES:
No owner or occupant of any building shall discharge or permit to be discharged
into the sanitary sewer any substances which will clog the pipes, produce
explosive mixtures, destroy or materially damage the pipes or joints, or
interfere unduly with the sewage disposal process 1 . (1983 Code § 4-5-15)
 
Notes
1 1. See section
  4-5-5 of this title.
4-6-16: INSPECTION AND APPROVAL:
All private sewers and their connections with the public sewers must be
inspected and approved in writing by the administrative officer before they are
covered, and the administrative officer shall keep a record of such approvals
in his/her office. If the administrative officer refuses to approve the work,
the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the work so that it
will meet with his/her approval. Each person who uses or intends to use the
public sewers shall permit the administrative officer or his/her authorized
assistant to enter the premises to inspect or make necessary alterations or
repairs at all reasonable hours and on proof of authority. (1983 Code § 4-5-16)
4-6-17: COMPLETION BY THE CITY:
Should any excavation be left open or partly refilled for twenty four (24)
hours after the private sewer is installed and connected with the public sewer,
or should the work be improperly done, the administrative officer shall have
the right to finish or correct the work, and the council shall assess the costs
to the property owner or the plumber. If the plumber is assessed, he/she must
pay the costs before he/she can receive another permit, and the plumber's bond
required by section
3-8-1 of this code shall be security for the assessment. If the property owner
is assessed, such assessment shall be collected with and in the same manner as
general property taxes. (1983 Code § 4-5-17)
4-6-18: INFILTRATION AND INFLOW (I&I):
In order to abate problems associated with "infiltration and inflow", which is
defined as the invasion of stormwater into the sanitary sewer system from
broken, cracked/misaligned mains, leaking manholes or manholes that have water
flowing over their covers, plus private (resident and business) services that
are cracked or broken and stormwater connections from foundation/footing
drains, sump pits and roof drains into sanitary sewers, the city is required to
adopt this section pursuant to the Iowa department of natural resources mandate
and therefore adopts the following provisions:
   A.   The city shall identify sources of I&I within the city by using
wastewater department staff and an engineering firm to complete inspections of
the private sewer connections.
      1.   In order to facilitate this process, duly authorized employees of
the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all private properties that have a connection to the city's sewer system
for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection and observation both prior
to and after all repair work completed on private sewer connections per this
section. The city shall not charge an inspection fee for sewer rehabilitation
inspections related to this section.
      2.   Should the property owner deny access to the property for I&I
testing and/or inspection, the city of Knoxville will consider the property
noncompliant with the city's I&I sewer rehabilitation program. A letter
notifying the owner of noncompliance will be sent to the property owner and the
property owner will be given thirty (30) days upon receipt of notice to
schedule the inspection or a fifty dollar ($50.00) per month fee shall be
applied to the property owner's utility bill until inspection or testing can
confirm compliance. If the property owner has failed to allow access after a
ninety (90) day period of time, the monthly fee will increase to seventy five
dollars ($75.00) until inspection or testing can confirm compliance.
   B.   Public sewers and manholes shall be repaired to eliminate all I&I.
      1.   When a roof, footing or foundation drain, or any other illegal
connection into the sanitary sewer system is identified, including when two (2)
private sewer laterals share a wye connection to the sewer main, it shall be
disconnected from the sanitary sewer system.
   C.   The owner of each property with a sanitary sewer connection will be
notified if there are any sources of I&I existing within their private sewer
connection. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to repair and
remove any sources of I&I.
   D.   Upon notification of a connection other than a sump pump or leaking
service from the city (regular first class mail) of I&I flowing from the
private sanitary sewer into the sewer main, any sewer connection, including
illegal, broken, faulty or otherwise illegal connection, it shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to abate within a period of ninety (90)
days. All owners that retain a contractor to make the repairs within ninety
(90) days of notification or less shall be eligible for one of the following
finance options:
      1.   Twenty five percent (25%) reimbursement (not to exceed $875.00) for
the disconnection and/or repair costs, or
      2.   Loan amounts may range from three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) to
seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) with a three percent (3%) interest rate.
Loan term may vary but shall not exceed ten (10) years. Loan requests will be
approved by the city manager or his/her designee. If financial hardship can be
demonstrated with regard to cost in excess of seven thousand dollars
($7,000.00), the council may approve a higher loan amount. Examples of loan
repayment schedules are outlined below:
 
Loan Amount Interest Rate Loan Term
$3,000.00   3%            5 years
4,000.00    3%            7 years
5,000.00    3%            8 years
5,500.00    3%            9 years
7,000.00    3%            10 years
 
      3.   Once an inspection of the repair work on private sewer connections
has been completed by the Knoxville wastewater department staff, the property
is deemed "compliant" with the I&I sewer rehabilitation program and in the
cases where monthly noncompliance fees have been charged to the property owner,
the noncompliance fee will be removed.
      4.   Inspection by city staff, both prior to and after repairs, shall be
necessary for a reimbursement or loan. In addition, a billing statement for
services performed shall accompany the request for reimbursement.
   E.   For those property owners who opt not to repair the source of I&I,
whether it be a broken, illegal, faulty or otherwise illegal connection, from
the sanitary sewer after the ninety (90) day period, a fifty dollar ($50.00)
per month fee shall be applied to the utility bill until the disconnection/
repair has been performed, but not to exceed one year. By the end of the one
year period, the owner shall have completed the disconnection. If the owner has
failed to repair the illegal connection within the year, the monthly fee will
increase to seventy five dollars ($75.00) per month until repairs have been
made.
By the end of the second one year period, the owner shall have completed the
disconnection. If the owner has failed to repair the illegal connection, the
city will seek to enforce this policy using all lawful means, including, but
not limited to, the prosecution of a municipal infraction which could result in
a civil penalty, court cost, and/or a court order requiring that repairs be
made within a certain time period.
   F.   In consideration of the fact that stormwater connections from sump pump
drains and other similar drains into the sanitary sewer have been illegal since
1975, upon written notification from the city of Knoxville, via regular first
class mail, property owners shall have a period of thirty (30) days to remove
all methods/systems of connection of sump pumps, downspouts or other drainage
systems which are illegally connected to a sanitary sewer.
For those property owners who opt not to disconnect a sump pump, downspout or
other illegal connections from the sanitary sewer after the thirty (30) day
period, a fifty dollar ($50.00) per month fee shall be applied to the utility
bill until the disconnection has been performed.
Within two (2) years after notification the owner shall have made the
disconnection. If the owner has failed to repair the illegal connection, the
city will enforce this policy using all lawful means, including, but not
limited to, the prosecution of a municipal infraction which could result in a
civil penalty, court costs, and/or a court order requiring that repairs be made
within a certain time period. If this procedure is required, no financing
options will be available to the owner for this repair.
   G.   In no case shall a joint sewer be allowed where the property abuts on a
street, alley or easement in which there is a public sewer. Other buildings in
adjacent areas, which are required to be connected, shall be separately and
independently connected to the public sewers unless the city council in a duly
adopted resolution specifically permits joint connections, in accordance with
plans approved by the council.
(Ord. 13-06, 6-3-2013)
4-6-19: SERVICE OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS:
   Sewer service shall be provided to any customer outside the corporate limits
of the City, who is billed through Knoxville Water Works and which the City has
agreed to serve at rates one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the residential/
commercial rates. No such customer, however, will be served unless the customer
shall have signed a service contract agreeing to be bound by the ordinances,
rules and regulations applying to sewer service established by the Council and
agreeing to be voluntarily annexed into the corporate limits of the City at
such future time as the City Council may determine is prudent. Customers
located outside the City limits shall be responsible for all costs related to
the customer hooking up to the City’s sewer system.

nuisance is found to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such
reasonable time as allowed by the city, the city may enter upon the property
and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual
cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied
against the property. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority

property as allowed by law and be collected in the same manner as property
taxes.
   D.   Certification: The director shall certify to the city clerk any
comprehensive stormwater service charge, which is owed after a sixty (60) day
payment period. All certified service charges constitute a lien upon the
premises served by the stormwater system for which the service charges were
made and shall be collected in the same manner as property taxes. Failure to
send or receive a bill for comprehensive stormwater service charge is not a
defense to the collection of the service charges.
   E.   Collection: Suits for collection shall be commenced by the city in the
Iowa district court for Marion County. No lien shall be imposed for delinquent
collections unless a judgment is first obtained from a court of competent

less than twenty (20) potential subscribers per lineal mile of trunk or
distribution cable, service may be made available on the basis of a capital
contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and
easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in
aid on construction to be borne by the grantee and subscribers in the areas in
which service may be expanded, the grantee will contribute an amount equal to
the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers per lineal mile of
its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals twenty (20)
potential subscribers. Subscribers who request service hereunder will bear the
remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The grantee
may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction
borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.

that the amount paid is in fact, the correct amount; nor shall such acceptance
of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for
additional sums payable by the grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to
audit and recomputation by the City.
      3.   Limitation Of Franchise Fee Actions: The period of limitation for
recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be ten (10) years from
the date on which payment by the grantee is due.
      4.   Audit: The grantee will fully cooperate with a franchise fee audit
performed by a professional firm that is chosen by the City. The costs
associated with the audit will be paid for by the City; provided, that the
grantee shall pay for the costs if the audit shows an underpayment of franchise
fees in excess of five percent (5%) or more. In addition, the City and grantee
will design a mutually agreeable form to be used by the grantee that reflects a
breakout of the items used to calculate the franchise fees paid to the City.
      5.   Increases: The City may request an increase in franchise fees at any
time during the term of the franchise, equal to the maximum allowed by federal
law. However, such request shall be made in writing and the grantee will not be
liable for said increase until proper notice, as defined by Federal law, is
given to its subscriber. Such changes in the franchise fee shall be implemented
within ninety (90) days of notice from the City. Additionally, such increases
shall not be implemented until grantee has had an opportunity to address said
increase at a regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council.
   B.   Rates And Charges:
      1.   The franchising authority may regulate rates for the provision of
basic cable and equipment as expressly permitted by section 623 of the Cable
Act of 1992, as amended, and applicable law.
      2.   Any rate adjustments shall be filed with the City Clerk not later
than thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of the adjustment.
   C.   Renewal Of Franchise: The franchising authority and the grantee agree
that any proceedings undertaken by the franchising authority that relate to the
grantee's franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of
section 626 in the Cable Act, as amended, unless the procedures and substantive
protections set forth therein shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded by
the provisions of any subsequent provision of Federal or State law.
   D.   Condition Of Sale:
      1.   If a renewal or extension of the grantee's franchise is denied or
the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the franchising authority either
lawfully acquires ownership of the system or by its actions lawfully effects a
transfer of ownership of the system to another party, any such acquisition or
transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth
in section 627 of the Cable Act of 1992.
      2.   In the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the
franchise, at the grantee's request, which shall be made in its sole
discretion, the grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a
transfer of its system to a qualified third party. The franchising authority
further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize the
grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise.
However, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater
than six (6) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end
of that time, the grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee
or assignee of its system which is reasonably acceptable to the franchising
authority, the grantee and the franchising authority may avail themselves of
any rights they may have pursuant to Federal or State law. The grantee's
continued operation of its system during the six (6) month period shall not be
deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the
franchising authority or the grantee.
   E.   Transfer Of Franchise:
      1.   The grantee's right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not
be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an
entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the grantee,
without the prior consent of the franchising authority. Such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a
transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any
rights, title, or interest of the grantee in the franchise or system in order
to secure indebtedness. Within thirty (30) days of receiving the request for
transfer, the franchising authority shall, in accordance with FCC rules and
regulations, notify the grantee in writing of the information it requires to
determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee.
If the franchising authority has not taken action on the grantee's request for
transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving such request,
consent by the franchising authority shall be deemed given.
      2.   Prior approval of the City Council shall be required for the sale,
transfer, or other disposition of interest in or right of control over the
grantee or its assets whenever such sale, transfer, or disposition in itself or
in an accumulated total of related transactions changes the interest in or
control of the grantee by forty percent (40%) or more.
      3.   When the Grantor approves a transfer under this subsection, the new
grantee shall indicate acceptance of the franchise as specified in subsection
7-4-4F of this Chapter.
      4.   It shall be a violation of this Chapter for any individual or group
of individuals acting in concert to formally or informally authorize any other
individual or group of individuals to act as their nominee or to mislead the
Council in any way in regard to the sale, transfer, or disposition of interest
in or control of the grantee.
      5.   The restrictions of this subsection shall be effective immediately
upon execution of a franchise agreement.
   F.   Right Of Inspection Of Construction: The City shall have the right to
inspect all construction or installation work performed subject to the
provisions of the permit and to make such inspections as it shall find
necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this permit and other
pertinent provision of law.
   G.   New Developments: The grantee is encouraged to upgrade its facilities,
equipment, and service so that its system is as advanced as the current state
of production technology will allow. Such new developments may be a topic of
discussion at any review sessions and shall be a factor to be considered in
connection with requests for rate adjustments. (Ord. 96-1, 2-5-1996)
7-4-8: COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING:
   A.   Testing For Compliance: The franchising authority may perform technical
tests of the system during reasonable times and in a manner which does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the grantee of
the system in order to determine whether or not the grantee is in compliance
with the terms hereof and applicable State or Federal laws. Except in emergency
circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving grantee
reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two (2) business days, and
providing a representative of the grantee an opportunity to be present during
such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the grantee has
substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the
reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the grantee. In the event that
such testing demonstrates that the grantee has substantially complied with such
material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the
franchising authority. Except in emergency circumstances, the franchising
authority agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no more than once a
year, and that the results thereof shall be made available to the grantee.
   B.   Books And Records: The franchising authority or its certified public
accountant upon reasonable notice to the grantee, may review such of its books
and records at the grantee's business office, during normal business hours and
on a nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with
the terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any
public records required to be kept by the grantee pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it
reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature under State and
Federal rules of evidence. The franchising authority agrees to treat any
information disclosed by the grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to
employees, representatives, and agent thereof that have a need to know, or in
order to enforce the provisions hereof. The grantee shall not be required to
provide subscriber information in violation of section 631 of the Cable Act.
   C.   Communications With Regulatory Agencies: Copies of all petitions,
applications, communications, reports, and all other documents submitted by the
grantee to the FCC, or any other Federal or State regulatory commission or
agency shall be made available to the City upon written request to the grantee.
   D.   Complaint Records: The grantee shall maintain detailed logs setting
forth and date the substance of each complaint received by phone, mail or other
means during the preceding calendar month, if any, the name and address of each
complaining party, and the date and nature of action taken by the grantee to
respond to such complaints, or, if still pending, the status thereof. Such logs
shall be available to the City for review for one year thereafter. Name and
address of complaining party shall not be provided unless prior consent is
obtained from said party.
   E.   City Role In Complaints: Unresolved complaints concerning the system or
its operation or maintenance shall be directed to the City Manager. The City
Manager shall forward the complaint to the grantee or shall take the question
up by correspondence with the grantee. Within thirty (30) days the grantee
shall resolve the complaint or advise the City of its refusal or inability to
do so. When the grantee resolves the complaint, it shall so notify the City. If
a complaint has not been resolved, the complainant may petition the City to
take any appropriate action authorized by this Chapter.
   F.   Performance Testing: Grantee shall perform all system tests and
maintenance procedures as required by the FCC and this Chapter and in
accordance with grantee's standards of good operating practice.
   G.   Review Sessions:
      1.   In recognition of the fact that a great many technical, financial,
marketing and legal uncertainties are associated with all aspects of cable
communications at the present time, it is the intent of the City to provide for
a maximum feasible degree of flexibility in this franchise throughout its term
to achieve an advanced and modern system for the City. The principal means for
accomplishing this flexibility will be the review sessions provided for in this
Chapter. It is intended that such review sessions will serve as a means of
cooperatively working out solutions to problems that develop. Furthermore, such
review sessions shall be two-way processes. For example, if either party has
perceived that some major problem has developed, the session shall be devoted
primarily to working out solutions acceptable to both parties.
      2.   The City and the grantee may hold scheduled review sessions no later
than April 30, of the calendar year 1997, and every third year thereafter for
the duration of the franchise. All such review sessions shall be open to the
public and notice thereof shall be published once, not less than four (4) days
or more than twenty (20) days before each review session, as provided by law.
The published notice shall specify the topics to be discussed. The review
sessions may be canceled by mutual agreement of the City and grantee.

session:

party. Members of the general public may also request additional topics.

information for use during the review sessions, renewal process and/or rate

shall be paid by the City.

authority's streets and public ways for the purpose of constructing or
operating a cable system or providing cable service to any part of the service
area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those

under the law.

notice or response required by the franchise to be served upon the franchising
authority or the grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been

intended solely to facilitate the reading thereof. Such captions shall not
affect the meaning of interpretation of the text herein.

hereof is determined to be illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional, by any court
of competent jurisdiction or by any State or Federal regulatory authority
having jurisdiction thereof, such determination shall have no effect on the
validity of any other section, sentence, paragraph, term of provision hereof,
all of which will remain in full force and effect for the term of the
franchise, or any renewal or renewals thereof. Provided, however, that in the

and control of soil erosion for that parcel of land.
   C.   Compliance With Chapter; Building Permit Issuance: No building permits
for habitable structures shall be issued for any development or redevelopment
not complying with this chapter. (Ord. 79-18, 11-5-1979)
8-7-6: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Excess Stormwater Passage:
      1.   An excess stormwater passage shall be provided for all stormwater
storage areas. Such passage shall have capacity to convey through the proposed
development the excess stormwater from the tributary watershed. The capacity of
such excess stormwater passage shall be constructed in such a manner as to
transport the peak rate of runoff from a 100-year return frequency storm
assuming all storm sewers are inoperative, all upstream areas are fully
developed in accordance with the City's current land use plan, and that
antecedent rainfall has saturated the tributary watershed.
      2.   No buildings or structures shall be constructed within such passage,
or within one hundred feet (100') of the channel of any stream; however,
streets, parking lots, playgrounds, park areas, pedestrian walkways, utility
easements and other open space uses shall be considered compatible uses. In the
event such area is reshaped or its capacity to transport stormwater otherwise
restricted, the Manager shall notify the agency, party or parties causing said
restriction to remove the same, and set a reasonable time for its removal. If
said persons refuse to or are unable to comply with said order, the Manager
shall cause said restrictions to be removed at the expense of said persons.
      3.   Where a proposed development contains existing natural drainage,
appropriate land planning shall be undertaken to preserve said natural drainage
as part of the excess storm water passage.
   B.   Easements: Easements which cover excess storm water passages, storm
water storage areas and other control structures shall be granted to the City
for the purpose of repair, alteration or to ensure their proper operation;
however, the City shall reserve the right not to accept such easement or any
portion thereof.
   C.   Determination Of Storage Capacity: The volume of required storm water
storage shall be the total runoff from a 10-year return frequency storm from
the area as proposed for development less one and five-tenths (1.5) inches.
(Ord. 79-18, 11-5-1979)
8-7-7: MISCELLANEOUS STORM WATER STORAGE AREAS:
   A.   Paved Surfaces: Paved surfaces, including automobile parking lots in
proposed storm water storage areas shall have minimum grades of one percent
(1%) (100 units horizontal to 1 unit vertical) and shall be limited to storage
depths of one and one- half feet (11/2') maximum. Pavement base design and
construction shall be accomplished in such a manner as to prevent damage from
flooding. Control structures in paved areas shall be accessible for maintenance
and cleaning. The use of vortex control facilities at inlets to ensure that the
maximum allowable release rates are being developed shall be required as
necessary.
Where parking areas are used to store storm water, the areas of greatest depth
shall be restricted to the more remote, least used areas of the parking
facility.
   B.   Rooftop Surfaces: Rooftop storage of excess storm water shall be
designed with permanent type control inlets and parapet walls to contain excess
storm water. Adequate structural roof design shall be provided to ensure that
roof deflection does not occur which could cause roof failure. Over flow areas
shall be provided to ensure that the weight of stored storm water will never
exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
   C.   Underground Storage: Underground storm water storage facilities shall
be designed for easy access to accommodate the removal of accumulated sediment.
Such facilities shall be provided with positive gravity outlets. (Ord. 79-18,
11-5-1979)
8-7-8: CONTROL IN EXCESS OF REQUIREMENTS:
In the event storm water runoff control can be provided in excess of the
requirements of this Chapter and the benefit of such additional control would
accrue to the City at large, the City may provide public participation in the
increased cost of the control of storm water runoff in proportion to the
additional benefits received. (Ord. 79-18, 11-5-1979)
8-7-9: EMERGENCY:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter, whenever in the judgment
of the Manager a condition occurs in a storm water storage area that created a
dangerous and imminent health and safety hazard, the Manager shall order such
action as shall be effective immediately or in the time and manner prescribed
in the order itself. (Ord. 79-18, 11-5-1979)
8-7-10: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW:

Manager which has been given in connection with the enforcement of any
provision of this Chapter may request, and shall be granted, a hearing on the
matter before the City Council; provided, that such person shall file in the
office of the Manager a written petition requesting such hearing and setting
forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor. Upon receipt of such petition,
the Manager shall set a time and place for such hearing and shall give the
petitioner notice thereof. At such hearing, the petitioner shall be given an
opportunity to be heard and to show why such decision should be modified or
withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not later than thirty (30) days after

NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND BUILDINGS
SECTION:
9-3-1: Intent
9-3-2: Use Of Existing Lots Of Record
9-3-3: Nonconforming Uses Of Land
9-3-4: Nonconforming Use Of Structures
9-3-5: Repairs And Maintenance
9-3-6: Registration Of Nonconforming Uses
9-3-1: INTENT:
   A.   Prior Existence: Within the districts established by this title or
amendments that may later be adopted, there exists lots, structures and uses of
land and structures which were lawful before the ordinance codified herein was
passed or amended both which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this title or future amendment.
   B.   Continuation Of Nonconformity: It is the intent of this title to permit
these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival. It is further the intent of this title that nonconformities
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as ground for
adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. To
avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a change
in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the ordinance codified herein and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. "Actual construction" is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction; provided,
that such work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
   C.   Legal Nonconformity: To be a legal nonconforming structure, building,
lot, or use, the same must have been lawfully established on or before the
effective date of this title and must have been in active use. The provisions
of this section also shall apply to buildings, structures, uses of buildings or
structures, or uses of land which hereafter become nonconforming due to the
adoption of this title, amendments thereto, or rezonings.
   D.   Burden Of Proof: Landowners shall bear the burden of proof, to the
satisfaction of the city's zoning administrator, to show that a lot, use of
land, structure, use of structure, or characteristic of use of land that is
nonconforming with the current zoning ordinances in force on the subject land
comes under one or more of the exceptions to the zoning requirements provided
in this section and that such otherwise nonconforming lot, use of land,
structure, use of structure, or characteristic of use of land was lawfully
established on the subject property. Conformity or nonconformity runs with the
land, not with the owner. (Ord. 15-12, 8-17-2015)
9-3-2: USE OF EXISTING LOTS OF RECORD:
In any district where dwellings are permitted, a single- family dwelling may be
located or altered on any legally established lot or plot of official record as
of the effective date of this title which does not meet area and/or width
requirements of this title; provided, that the following conditions are met:
   A.   Side Yard: For lots or plots less than sixty feet (60') in width, each
side yard width shall not be less than five feet (5').
   B.   Rear Yard: The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed
twenty percent (20%) of the depth of the lot, but in no case shall be reduced
below twenty feet (20').
   C.   Front Yard: The depth of the front yard shall comply with the zoning
district in which it is located or with chapter 4 of this title.
   D.   Building Width And Area, And Garage Space: All single- family and two-
family dwellings constructed as of the effective date of this title shall
comply with the minimum building width and area requirements as well as the
enclosed parking space requirement as set forth in the zoning district in which
it is located.
   E.   Two Or More Lots: If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots or
parcels with continuous street frontage in single ownership are of record as of
the effective date of this title, or amendments thereto, and if all or part of
the lots or parcels do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as
established by this code, the lands involved shall be considered to be an
undivided, single parcel for the purposes of this title. No division of the
parcel shall be made which leaves remaining any lot or parcel with a width or
area below the requirements of this title. If such lots or parcels are to be
considered an undivided parcel, the owner will be required to either replat the
lots in question or to legally tie the lots together by recording a lot tie
agreement with the county recorder. (Ord. 15-12, 8-17-2015)
9-3-3: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND:
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified
herein, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the
terms of this title as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, subject
to the following provisions:
   A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged nor extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the ordinance codified herein.
   B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified herein.
   C.   If any such nonconforming uses of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six (6) months, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in which
such land is located.
   D.   If any property owner proposes an addition to any structure that does
not meet current setback requirements, but the proposed addition meets all
setback requirements, that proposal shall be permitted pending administrative
review and approval. (1983 Code § 11-1-8C; amd. Ord. 20-15, 10-5-2020; Ord. 20-
16, 10-5-2020)
9-3-4: NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES:
If a lawful use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified
herein that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title,
the lawful use may be continued, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Enlarge Or Extend: No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted
by this title in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged,
extended, constructed, reconstructed or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   B.   Occupy Land Outside Building: Any nonconforming use may be extended
throughout any of the parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or
designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance
codified herein, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside
such building.
   C.   Changed To More Restrictive Classification: If no structural
alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and
premises, may be changed to a more restricted classification.
   D.   Abandoned Or Discontinued Use: If any nonconforming use of a structure,
or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for one
year, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
   E.   Partial Removal Or Destruction: Where nonconforming use status applies
to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status
of the land. (1983 Code § 11-1-8D)
9-3-5: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Limited Repairs Allowed: On any building devoted in whole or in part to
any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing; provided, that
the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or
amendment of the ordinance codified herein shall not be increased.
   B.   Strengthen To Safe Condition: Nothing in this title shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or
part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the
public safety, upon order of such official. (1983 Code § 11-1-8E)

violations. Any subsequent violations may be treated as a Municipal infraction
and subject to the fines and penalties as set forth for those violations. In
any proceeding charging violation of these subsections, a prima facie

there is an error in order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
zoning administrator in enforcement of this title.
   B.   Authorize Variances: To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the public

provisions of this title will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of this title shall be observed and substantial justice done. A variance
from the terms of this title shall not be granted by the board unless and
until:
      1.   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:

by his agent or by attorney.
      3.   The board shall make findings that the requirements of this section
have been met by the applicant for a variance.

the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is
the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building or structure.
      5.   The board shall further make a finding that the granting of the
variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title,
and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the
public welfare.
      6.   In granting any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this title. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the

use not permissible under the terms of this title in the district involved, or
any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this title in

periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
      2.   These losses, hazards and related adverse effects are caused by: a)
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which
create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flood and b) the cumulative effect of floodplain
construction on flood flows, which causes increases in flood heights and
floodwater velocities.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare by minimizing those flood losses
described in subsection B2 of this section with provisions designed to:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      3.   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      4.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program. (Ord. 07-06, 10-15-2007)

before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial
improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term
does not, however, include either: 1) any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local Health, Sanitary or
Safety Code specifications which have been identified by the local Code
Enforcement Officer and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions or 2) any alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a "historic structure".

   C.   Subdivision Review: The Floodplain Administrator shall review all
subdivision proposals within the special flood hazard areas to assure that such
proposals are consistent with the purpose and spirit of this chapter and shall
advise the City Council of potential conflicts. Floodplain development in
connection with a subdivision (including installation of public utilities)
shall require a floodplain development permit as provided in subsection B of
this section. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five (5) acres or fifty
(50) lots (whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for
those areas located within the Floodplain District. (Ord. 07-06, 10-15-2007;

   D.   Variance:
      1.   Authorization: The Board of Appeals may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
         a.   Variances shall only be granted upon: 1) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, 2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and 3) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
         b.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         c.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: 1) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and 2) such construction
increases risks to life and property.
      2.   Factors Upon Which The Decision Of The Board Of Appeals Shall Be
Based: In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
         b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
         c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.

CHAPTER 18
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT
SECTION:
9-18-1: Intent
9-18-2: Procedures
9-18-3: Standards
9-18-1: INTENT:
The PUD District is intended to provide for the development or redevelopment of
land under the control and in accordance with an approved Master Plan. The
development guidelines and standards in which land uses, transportation
facilities, building densities, arrangements, and types are set out in a
unified Master Plan in order to provide greater flexibility of land use,
development densities, and building locations than other zoning districts may
allow.
The PUD District is intended to maximize benefits from the use of open spaces,
preserve natural areas and existing tree cover, protect steep slopes, maximize
aesthetics, encourage certain architectural standards for buildings, and permit
mixed uses and diversity of bulk regulations without endangering the general
health, safety, welfare, and land value of surrounding and internal properties.
A PUD may consist of a single use or a mix of residential, commercial, and
limited industrial uses, provided such PUD is compatible with the Future Land
Use Map and Comprehensive Plan of the City. It is not the intent of the PUD
District to be utilized to reduce or provide relief from an existing zoning
regulation or requirement. (Ord. 19-08, 7-1-2019)
9-18-2: PROCEDURES:
   A.   Application: The owner or owners of a parcel of land within the zoning
jurisdiction of the City may submit to the Zoning Administrator an application
accompanied by a PUD Master Plan requesting a rezoning to PUD District. The
application form, Master Plan (including number of copies), proposed
development rules and regulations, design guidelines, and other submittal
details and requirements shall be as determined by the Zoning Administrator as
necessary to review the request. The required application fee shall be as
determined by resolution of the City Council.
   B.   Review Process: The PUD Application shall be reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator for completeness. Applications deemed incomplete shall be
returned to the applicant with a list of the missing or incomplete items.
Applications deemed complete shall be distributed by the Zoning Administrator
to other City departments and agencies as necessary for review and comment as
to its compliance with all zoning regulations and other pertinent City codes,
regulations, standards, and policies.
Subsequent to review by the Zoning Administrator and other City departments and
agencies, the Zoning Administrator shall submit to all members of the Planning
and Zoning Commission a copy of the PUD Application along with a written
recommendation as to the request's conformity with the rules and regulations of
the City and may include a recommendation for approval, approval with
conditions, or denial of the application.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall subsequently hold a public hearing for
a rezoning as prescribed by their rules of procedures and the Zoning Ordinance
and review the PUD Application for conformity with the zoning regulations and
standards and may confer with the applicant on changes to their request as may
be deemed advisable. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the
following as part of their deliberation:
      1.   Compatibility with the Future Land Use Map and the Comprehensive
Plan.
      2.   Land uses, building sizes and densities, and number of dwelling
units.
      3.   Building types, functions, architecture, and building placement and
setbacks.
      4.   Provisions for open space, landscaping, buffers, pedestrian
circulation, and stormwater management.
      5.   Preservation and protection of natural features, drainageways, steep
slopes, and existing tree cover.
      6.   Provisions for adequate public infrastructure including sanitary
sewer and water service, stormwater run-off, public parks, and public safety
services.
      7.   Traffic circulation and congestions including access to and from the
site.
      8.   General relationship to and impact on the surrounding area and
neighboring properties.
After the close of the public hearing and completion of its deliberation, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may adopt a recommendation for approval or
denial of the PUD Master Plan and associated development rules, regulations,
and guidelines as submitted. The Planning and Zoning Commission may also
request the developer agree to certain conditions or agree to make certain
modifications, alterations, adjustments, or amendments to the proposed Master
Plan and associated rules, regulations, and guidelines in order to secure a
recommendation of approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the City
Council within sixty (60) days of the receipt of a PUD Application deemed
complete by the Zoning Administrator. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
does not act within the sixty (60) days as prescribed above, the PUD
Application shall be deemed to have received a recommendation of approval by
the Planning and Zoning Commission unless the applicant agrees to an extension
of time.
Within sixty (60) days of receiving a recommendation from the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the City Council shall hold a public hearing for a rezoning
as prescribed by their rules of procedures and the Zoning Ordinance and review
the PUD Application for conformity with the zoning regulations and standards.
During this hearing, the City Council may confer with the applicant on changes
to their request as may be deemed advisable in order to secure the approval by
the City Council. The City Council may approve, approve with conditions or
modifications as agreed to by the applicant, or deny the application. If the
City Council fails to act within the herein prescribed 60-day period, the PUD
Application shall be deemed to have been denied, unless both the applicant and
the City Council agree to an extension of time.
Whenever any PUD Application has been denied by the City Council, no new
application covering the same property, or the same property and additional
property, shall be filed with or considered by the City Council until one year
has elapsed from the date of the filing of the first application.
   C.   Recording Of The Master Plan And Associated Regulations And Guidelines:
The ordinance providing for the rezoning of the property to the PUD Zoning
District and the associated Master Plan, regulations, and guidelines as
approved by the City Council shall be recorded at the Office of the Marion
County Recorder and shall be binding on the property owners, their heirs,
successors, or assigns. No phase of the PUD shall be started, and no building
permits shall be issued until all documents have been recorded.
   D.   Modifications: Any application by the property owner or owners for
modification to an approved PUD shall first be reviewed by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Said proposed modification along with a report from the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall then be forwarded to the City Council with
appropriate recommendations. The City Council shall then take such appropriate
action on the proposed modification and their decision shall be final.
No modification may be considered that is more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in density or change of uses of the site without a public hearing by
the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council as required for a rezoning.
A public hearing may be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City
Council on any requested modification. All modifications and adjustments shall
be recorded at the Office of the Marion County Recorder.
   E.   Platting And Development: Prior to development within the PUD,
applications for preliminary and final plats, site plans, and building permits
that are in conformance with the provisions of the PUD shall be submitted for
review in accordance with the City's regulations. At the applicant's own risk,
Preliminary plats, final plats, and sites plans may be submitted and reviewed
concurrently with the PUD Application process. (Ord. 19-08, 7-1-2019)

   A.   Preparation; Filing: The owner or developer of any tract of land to be
subdivided shall cause a preliminary plat to be prepared of the subdivision
containing the information specified herein and shall file seven (7) copies of
the plat with the City Clerk.
   B.   Plat Submitted To Utilities: The Clerk shall immediately refer three
(3) copies of the preliminary plat to the Planning Commission and the developer

the commission within thirty (30) days thereof. The developer shall submit a
receipt showing delivery from each utility company to the commission.
   C.   Consideration By Plan Commission: The commission shall consider the
findings and recommendations of the utility companies and engineer and examine
the plat as to its compliance with this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan of
the City. The commission shall, as soon as possible, but not more than thirty
(30) days, consider said report, negotiate with the subdivider on changes
deemed advisable and the kind and extent of the improvements to be made by him,
and pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified. If the
City Planning Commission does not act within thirty (30) days, the preliminary
plat shall be deemed approved; provided, however, that the subdivider may agree
to an extension of time for a period not to exceed an additional sixty (60)
days. It shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of
approval, modification or disapproval. The commission may hold a public hearing
before acting on a preliminary plat, after publishing notice as provided in

consideration before approval will be given. The council shall forward one copy
of the preliminary plat and the city's resolution to the owner or developer.
      4.   Approval of the preliminary plat by the city council shall not
constitute final acceptance of the addition or subdivision by the city but an
authorization to proceed with preparation of the final plat.
      5.   The subdivider shall have a period of one hundred eighty (180) days
from the date of approval in which to submit a final plat or approval of the
preliminary plat shall expire and the preliminary plat shall be resubmitted for

as hereafter set forth, and upon his failure to do so within the time
specified, the "approval" of the preliminary plat shall be null and void unless
an extension of time is applied for and granted by the City Planning
Commission. Upon receipt of the final plat and other required documents, the
City Clerk shall transmit three (3) copies of the final plat to the City
Planning Commission for its recommendations and approval.
   C.   Action By The City Council: Upon receipt of the certification by the
City Planning Commission, the City Council shall, within thirty (30) days of

this effect. (1983 Code § 11-2-5C)
10-3-4: INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS:
The developer shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and ensure their satisfactory completion, such inspection to be
carried by a qualified engineer who will certify that the improvements meet
established City requirements. Subdivision improvements shall not be accepted
by the Council unless such certification has been made. If the engineer finds
upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed

at least thirty inches (30") long and seven-eighths inch (7/8") in diameter or
by round or square iron bars at least thirty inches (30") long.
   B.   All such monuments shall be set flush with the ground and planted in
such a manner that they will not be removed by frost and approved by a
registered land surveyor prior to enforcement of the final plat. (1983 Code §
11-2-6A)
10-4-2: BLOCKS:
   A.   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots
of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways.
   B.   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed one thousand three hundred
twenty feet (1,320'), nor be less than four hundred feet (400') in length.
   C.   In long blocks the reservation of an easement through the block to
accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or pedestrian traffic may be
required.
   D.   Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet (10') wide, may be
required through the center of blocks more than eight hundred feet (800') long
where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities.
Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be
determined suitable by the Plan and Zoning Commission for prospective use.
(1983 Code § 11-2-6B)
10-4-3: LOT DESIGN:
   A.   Arrangement: The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance, Title 9 of this Code, and health regulations and in providing
driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved street.
   B.   Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of
Title 9 of this Code. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area
for the zoning district, the Commission may require that such lots be arranged
so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they
would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with Title 9
of this Code and these regulations. In general, side lot lines shall be at
right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a
variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of
corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing
the minimum front-yard setback from both streets. Depth and width of properties
reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be
adequate to provide for the off- street parking and loading facilities required
for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in Title 9 of
this Code.
   C.   Double Frontage Lots And Access To Lots:
      1.   Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
      2.   Access From Arterial And Collector Streets: Lots should not, in
general, derive access exclusively from a collector or arterial street. Where
driveway access from such street may be necessary for several adjoining lots,
the Plan and Zoning Commission may require that such lots be served by a
combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazard on such street.
Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid
requiring vehicles to back into traffic on collector or arterial streets. (1983
Code § 11-2-6C)
10-4-4: STREETS, GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Grading Plan: Roads shall be graded to conform to the construction
standards and specifications recommended by the City Engineer and approved by
the City Council prior to final plat endorsement.
   B.   Topography And Arrangement:
      1.   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local roads
should be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and curves should be avoided. (See design standards of these
regulations, Section
10-4-5 of this Chapter.)
      2.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and rights of way established according to
width standards set forth by the Comprehensive Plan.
      3.   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
      4.   Minor or local streets should be laid out to discourage use by
through traffic and to permit efficient drainage and utility systems. The use
of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, and loop streets shall be encouraged where
such use will result in a more desirable layout.
      5.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas and
walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the
various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
   C.   Arrangement Of Streets: The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation
is in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right of
way shall be extended to the property line. The Commission may require that a
temporary T- or L-shaped turnabout be provided on any temporary dead-end
street, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal
street right of way shall revert to abuttors whenever the street is continued.
The Plan and Zoning Commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end
streets in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
   D.   Cul-De-Sacs: Where a cul-de-sac is permitted, its terminus shall
normally not be nearer to the boundary of the subdivision that the minimum lot
depth requirement of the zoning district in which it is located. The Plan and
Zoning Commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement at the
closed end of the cul-de-sac to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic, and/or utilities. Minimum turn-around radii and maximum length shall
be limited as provided by subsection 10-4-4E below.
   E.   Proposed Streets:
      1.   Extension Of Streets: Proposed streets shall be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or
other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Plan and Zoning
Commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of
the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous
future development or adjacent tracts.
      2.   New Perimeter Streets: Street systems shall be laid out so as to
avoid perimeter half-streets. The Plan and Zoning Commission may authorize a
new perimeter street where the subdivider dedicates the entire required street
right-of-way width within his own subdivision boundaries and bears the cost for
improving such street in accordance with approved standards, provided, that
part of the cost of said perimeter street may at the discretion of the City
Council be assessed against the adjacent property owner.
   F.   Widening And Realignment Of Existing Roads:
      1.   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the
Comprehensive Plan indicates plans for realignment or widening a road that
would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the developer shall
dedicate at his expense such areas as are required for widening or realignment
of such roads to meet minimum requirements.
      2.   Such streets shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his
own expense to the full width as required by these subdivision regulations for
a local street; provided, that any improvement which the City requires that
exceeds minimum requirements for a local street will be made at City expense.
Land reserved for any road purposes shall not be counted in satisfying yard or
area requirements of Title 9 of this Code.
   G.   Alleys: Alleys may be required in business and industrial subdivisions
for adequate access to block interiors and to off-street loading and parking
spaces, but shall as a rule not be permitted in residential subdivisions.
   H.   Access To Arterial Streets: Where a subdivision borders on or contains
an existing or proposed arterial street, the Plan and Zoning Commission may
require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
      1.   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial and front
onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the arterial
street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear
property line of such lots.
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the
rear lines of their terminal lots backing on the major arterial.
      3.   A marginal access or service road (separated from the arterial
street by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable
points).
   I.   Railroads And Limited Access Highways: Railroad rights of way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
      1.   In residential districts a buffer strip at least twenty five feet
(25') in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the
district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right of way or limited
access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be
designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of
structures hereon is prohibited".
      2.   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
      3.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least one hundred fifty feet (150') from the railroad right of
way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
   J.   Bridges: Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by
the City Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant
without reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction
of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the City
Council will be fixed by special agreement between the City Council and the
subdivider. Said cost shall be charged to the subdivider pro rata as the
percentage of his land developed and so served.
   K.   Street Names: Street names shall be sufficiently different in sound and
in spelling from other street names in the City so as not to cause confusion. A
road which is or is planned as a continuation of an existing road shall bear
the same name.
   L.   Street Name Signs: Street name signs are to be placed at all
intersections within or abutting the subdivision. The type and location of said
signs shall be recommended by the City Manager and approved by the City
Council.
   M.   Street Lights: Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards recommended by the City
Engineer or City Manager and approved by the City Council. (1983 Code § 11-2-
6D)
10-4-5: STREETS, DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Rights Of Way: Street rights of way shall have a minimum width as shown
in the Comprehensive Plan for the type of street involved.
   B.   Surfacing And Improvements: All roadways to be dedicated to the City
shall be surfaced with Portland cement concrete with integral curb and gutter.
Minimum pavement width shall be twenty seven feet (27') for local streets and
as provided by the Comprehensive Plan and approved by the City Council for
collector and arterial streets. Said improvements and surfacing shall be in
accordance with design specifications and standards recommended by the City
Engineer or City Manager and approved by the City Council prior to final plat
endorsement, and shall be installed at the subdivider's expense after sewer and
water utilities have been installed by the subdivider; provided, that the cost
of any pavement width in excess of twenty seven feet (27'), as may be required
for collector or arterial streets, may, at the Council's discretion, be borne
by the City. Adequate provisions shall be made for culverts, drains and
bridges.
   C.   Grades: Maximum grade for local residential streets shall be eight
percent (8%), and maximum grade for local commercial-industrial streets shall
be six percent (6%). Maximum grade for any collector or arterial street shall
be six percent (6%). All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical
curves of such length and configuration as may be recommended by the City
Engineer and approved by the City Council.
   D.   Radius Of Curves: Minimum radius of curves shall be one hundred feet
(100') on the center line for any residential local or collector street, and
two hundred feet (200') on any commercial-industrial local or collector street.
Minimum radius for any arterial street shall be three hundred feet (300') on
the center line, except that the Council may require a larger radius upon
recommendation from the City Engineer.
   E.   Length Of Tangents: Minimum length of tangents between reverse curves
shall be one hundred feet (100') for any local residential street and one
hundred fifty feet (150') for any residential collector street. Minimum length
of said tangent for any local or collector commercial-industrial street shall
be two hundred feet (200'), and minimum tangent for any arterial shall be three
hundred feet (300').
   F.   Cul-De-Sacs: Permanent cul-de-sacs may be permitted if such arrangement
will improve the subdivision design, but shall in no case exceed six hundred
feet (600') in length or serve more than fourteen (14) dwelling units. Minimum
pavement width shall be twenty seven feet (27'). A circular turnaround shall be
provided having a minimum right of way radius of fifty five feet (55') and a
minimum pavement curb radius of forty five feet (45').
   G.   Cross-Slopes: The cross-slope on all streets, including intersections
shall not exceed four percent (4%).
   H.   Intersections:
      1.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of
less than seventy five degrees (75°) shall not be acceptable. An oblique street
should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at
right angles for at least one hundred feet (100') therefrom. Not more than two
(2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by
the City Council.
      2.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
should, whenever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than
one hundred fifty feet (150') shall not be permitted, except where specifically
approved by the City Council. Where any major street is intersected by any
other street, the alignment of said intersecting street shall generally be
continuous.
      3.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) local streets
shall be at least twenty feet (20'); and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a collector or arterial street shall be at least twenty five feet
(25'); provided, that at any intersection where a curb radius has been
previously established, such radius shall be used as standard. Alley
intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the
corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe
vehicular movement.
      4.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having a grade and length as may be recommended
by the City Engineer and approved by the City Council.
      5.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including
trees) in connection with the grading of the public right of way to provide an
adequate sign distance as provided by Title 9 of this Code. (1983 Code § 11-2-
6E)
10-4-6: DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS:
   A.   General Requirements: The City Council shall not approve any
subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for drainage of storm
or flood water runoff. The storm water drainage system will be separate and
independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required shall be
designed according to the method recommended by a certified engineer and
approved by the City Council, and a copy of design computations shall be
submitted along with plans. Inlets should be arranged so that surface water is
not generally carried across any intersection. When calculations indicate that
curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for
flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that
point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot
and block. Storm drainage collectors should be handled in a manner which is
efficient and economic for all parties involved subject to the approval of the
City Council.
   B.   Accommodation Of Upstream Drainage Areas: A culvert of other drainage
facility should in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff
from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. A qualified engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
as established by land uses projected in the comprehensive plan, and as
permitted by the zoning regulations applicable to such land uses.
   C.   Dedication Of Drainage Easements:
      1.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right of way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction as will be adequate for the purpose. Where
possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel
with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      2.   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of drainage facilities within the road rights of way, the Council
may require that perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen feet (15')
in width be provided across property outside the road lines to provide
satisfactory access from the road to such drainage facilities, and may also
require that easements be provided to carry drainage from the road to said
drainage facilities outside the road right of way. All drainage easements shall
be indicated on the plat.
      3.   The City Council may require dedication to the City, either in fee
or by drainage or conservation easement, of land on both sides of existing
watercourses, to a distance to be determined by the Plan and Zoning Commission
or City Engineer, if such dedication is deemed necessary to assure preservation
of said watercourses, drainageways, channels or streams.
      4.   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the number of lots to be utilized for planned unit development nor
for computing the area requirement of any lot. (1983 Code § 11-2-6F)
10-4-7: WATER FACILITIES:
   A.   Public Water:
      1.   Where a public water main is accessible the subdivider shall install
adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) in accordance to the plans
and specifications adopted by the City Council and Water Board. All water mains
shall be at least six inches (6") in diameter and shall be properly valved and
looped where feasible to ensure adequate water pressure.
      2.   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, all
water supply improvements and all development proposed to be served shall be
shown on the preliminary plat, and the cost of installing same shall be
included in the performance bond to be furnished by the subdivider.
   B.   Individual Wells And Central Water Systems:
      1.   In low-density zoning districts, at the discretion of the City
Council, if a public water system is not available, individual wells may be
used or a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate
supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision.
Water samples shall be submitted to the Health Department for its approval, and
individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the City Council
prior to approval of the final plat.
      2.   If the City Council requires that a connection to a public water
main be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or
central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds
may be required to ensure compliance.
   C.   Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions
except those with approved individual wells. Fire hydrants shall be located as
approved by the City Council after recommendation from the Water Board and the
Knoxville Fire Department. To eliminate future street openings, all underground
utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves and all
other supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a
street shown on the subdivision plat. (1983 Code § 11-2-6G)
10-4-8: SANITARY SEWER FACILITIES:
Sanitary sewer facilities shall be provided by the subdivider for each lot in
accordance with the general regulations listed below and with design
specifications and plans approved by the City Council prior to final plat
endorsement. The Council may seek recommendation from the City Engineer in
determining design criteria for said facilities.
   A.   Public Sanitary Sewer: Where a public sanitary sewerage system is
reasonably accessible the subdivider shall connect with same and provide sewers
accessible to each lot in the subdivision. Design criteria for slope, size,
manhole locations, manhole and pipe elevations, materials, construction
techniques and other considerations shall be approved by the City Council.
      1.   Design: Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for the ultimate
tributary population. Due consideration should be given to current zoning
regulations and approved planning and zoning reports where applicable. Sewer
capacities should be adequate to handle the anticipated maximum hourly quantity
of sewerage and industrial waste together with an adequate allowance for
infiltration and other extraneous flow.
      2.   Maximum Size: The diameter of sewers proposed shall not exceed the
diameter of the existing or proposed outlet, whichever is applicable, unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
      3.   Minimum Size: No public sewer shall be less than eight inches (8")
in diameter.
      4.   Location: Sewers shall generally be located within street or alley
rights of way unless topography dictates otherwise. Where sewers are located in
easements on private property, access shall be provided to all manholes.
      5.   Drainage Into Potable Water Prohibited: Adequate provisions shall be
made to prevent any sewage from entering any source of potable water. The
Council may require a minimum horizontal distance of ten feet (10') to be
maintained between parallel water and sewer lines or for sewer line to be
installed at least two feet (2') below any water main or other precautions.
      6.   Connection To Sanitary Sewer System: In accordance with chapter 13
of the State Plumbing Code storm sewerage, foundations drains, roof drains and
similar installations shall not be connected to the sanitary sewer system
unless expressly permitted by the City Council.
   B.   Individual Sewerage Systems:
      1.   If public sanitary sewer facilities are not available when the
subdivision is platted and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum
lot areas shall conform to the requirements of Title 9 of this Code, and
percolation tests and test holes shall be made as directed by the Board of
Health and the results submitted with design specifications for the individual
disposal system, including the size of the tile fields or other secondary
treatment device, at the time the preliminary plat is submitted for review by
the Plan and Zoning Commission. Said systems shall be approved by the
Commission and Council. Cesspools shall not be permitted.
      2.   Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably accessible
but will become available within a period of not to exceed fifteen (15) years
as determined by the City Engineer and City Council, the Council may require
that the subdivider install sanitary sewer lines, laterals and mains within the
subdivision to a point in the subdivision boundary where a future connection
with the public sewer shall be made. Sewer lines shall be laid to the house
from the street line, and a connection shall be available in the home to
connect from the individual disposal system to said sewer system when the
public sewer becomes available. Such sewer shall be capped until ready for use
and shall conform to all plans for installation of the public sewer system,
where such exist and shall be ready for connection to such public sewer mains.
Provisions shall be made in the performance bond or escrow agreement for
installation and dedication of said system.
   C.   Connection To Public Sewer System: If a public sewer is accessible and
a sanitary sewer is placed in a street or alley abutting upon property, the
owner thereof may be required to connect to said sewer for the purpose of
disposing water, and it may be deemed unlawful for any such owner or occupant
upon any such property to operate and maintain an individual sewage disposal
system. (1983 Code § 11-2-6H)
10-4-9: UTILITIES:
The City Council may require all utility facilities, including, but not limited
to, gas, electrical lines of nominal voltage not in excess of fifteen thousand
(15,000) volts, telephone and CATV cables, to be located under ground
throughout the subdivision. Wherever existing utilities are located above
ground, except where existing on public roads and rights of way, the Council
may require that they be removed and placed under ground. All utility
facilities existing and proposed and their easement throughout the subdivision
shall be shown on the plat. The subdivider shall be responsible for making the
necessary arrangements with the utility companies for installation of such
facilities. Said utility lines shall be installed in a manner so as not to
interfere with other underground utilities. Incidental appurtenances, such as
transformers and their enclosures, pedestal mounted terminal boxes, meters and
meter boxes may be placed aboveground but shall be located so as not to be
unsightly or hazardous to the public. In their determination whether or not to
require underground utilities, the Council and Commission may consider that
soil, topographical or other conditions make such installations within the
subdivision unreasonable or impractical. (1983 Code § 11-2-6I)
10-4-10: EASEMENTS:
Easements for utilities (private and public) may be required along rear or side
lot lines where deemed necessary. Total width of such easements shall be at
least ten feet (10'). (1983 Code § 11-2-6J)
10-4-11: SIDEWALKS:
   A.   Subdivider's Expense: Sidewalks shall be installed at the subdivider's
expense along both sides of any street being dedicated for public use and on
any frontage of an existing dedicated street except where the existing street
has no established grade, in which case the provision of Section
10-3-1 of this Title shall apply. Sidewalks shall be at least four feet (4')
wide and shall be constructed in accordance with design specifications of the
City Engineer or City Manager.
   B.   Pedestrian Accesses: The Plan and Zoning Commission or City Council may
require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools,
parks, playgrounds or other nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements or
dedicated rights of way at least fifteen feet (15') in width for provision of
sidewalks. Such easements or rights of way shall be indicated on the plat.
(1983 Code § 11-2-6K)
10-4-12: DEBRIS AND WASTE:
No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or
other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or
deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of an occupancy
permit, and removal of same shall be required prior to issuance of any
occupancy permit in a subdivision. Nor shall any be left or deposited in any
area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or
dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner. (1983 Code § 11-2-6L)
10-4-13: SOIL PRESERVATION AND GRADING:
   A.   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any lot until the final
grading of said lot has been completed in such manner as will provide positive
surface drainage away from all foundations and will prevent the ponding of
water on the lot; nor until provisions have been made to establish a permanent
ground cover on all exposed soil surfaces. Lots shall be arranged and drainage
designed so as to avoid undue concentration of storm drainage water from each
lot to adjacent lots.
   B.   Also, provided that the City Council may seek to reduce soil losses and
undue sedimentation of drainage ways or facilities during subdivision
construction by requiring provisions to be made to prevent soil losses due to
erosion of soil exposed by construction and grading practices; such provisions
as may be required include, but are not limited to, establishment of a mulch or
a temporary ground cover on exposed soil surfaces after rough grading has been
completed, and maintenance of temporary sedimentation basins on the site while
grading and other earth moving is being conducted. (1983 Code § 11-2-6M)
10-4-14: PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES:
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the
community as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, historic spots and similar
irreplaceable assets, should be preserved in the design of the subdivision.
Trees to be retained should be welled and protected against change of grade.
(1983 Code § 11-2-6N)

10-5-2: SUITABILITY TO THE LAND:
Land which the Plan and Zoning Commission or City Council finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage,
adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements or other features
which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding
areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are
formulated by the subdivider and approved by the Plan and Zoning Commission and
City Council, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger. (1983
Code § 11-2-8)
10-5-3: VACATION OF PLATS:
   A.   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated.
   B.   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Plan and Zoning Commission
and Council in like manner as plats of subdivision. The Council may reject any
such instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its
public uses, improvements, streets or alleys.
   C.   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved and
recorded or filed, in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly
recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alleys and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described
in such plat.
   D.   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein
provided by all the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution of
such writing. (1983 Code § 11-2-9)
10-5-4: INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS:
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Title shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health,
safety and general welfare. These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive shall control. (1983 Code § 11-
2-10)
10-5-5: FEES:
The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees and charges by resolution
for the filing of preliminary and final plats to cover the processing and
reviewing of the plats. At the time of filing any preliminary plat or final
plat with the City for consideration, the subdivider or his agent shall pay the
established fee. (Ord. 85-9, 12-16-1985, eff. 1-1-1986)
10-5-6: VARIANCES:
   A.   General: Where the City Council, upon approval by the Planning
Commission, finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may
result from strict compliance with these regulations and the purposes of these
regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternate proposal, it may
approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that substantial justice
may be done and the public interest secured; provided, that such variance shall
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations;
and further provided, the City Council shall not approve variances unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property to which it is
located.
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property.
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, topography
or other unique conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner will result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out;
      4.   The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of Title 9
of this Code or Comprehensive Plan.
   B.   Conditions: In approving any variance, the City Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
   C.   Procedures: A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Planning Commission and City Council. The petition
shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied
upon by the petitioner.
   D.   Granting Of Variance: Where the Planning Commission has not recommended
approval of the requested variance, the City Council may grant the variance,
provided it meets the other requirements of this Section, and further provided
that the variance only be granted by affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of
the members of the City Council. (Ord. 87-3, 7-6-1987)
10-5-7: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Enforcement Official: It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator
to enforce these regulations and to bring to the attention of the City Council
any violations or lack of compliance herewith.
   B.   Subdivision Approval: No plat of any subdivision shall be recorded in
the County Recorder's office or have any validity until it has been approved in
the manner prescribed herein.
   C.   Public Improvements: The City Council shall not permit any public
improvements over which it has control to be made from City funds, or any City
money to be expended for improvements or maintenance on any street in any area
which has been subdivided after the date of adoption of this Title unless such
subdivision and improvements have been approved in accordance with the
provisions contained herein and public improvements dedicated to the City as
required by these regulations.
