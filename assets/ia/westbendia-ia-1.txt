feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
5.Â Â Â Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
6.Â Â Â Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight line
to meet the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Recommended grade at one-fourth inch per foot.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum grade of one-eighth inch per foot.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum velocity of two feet per second with the sewer half full.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only with the written
approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with approved fittings.
7.Â Â Â Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
8.Â Â Â Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building
sewer.
9.Â Â Â Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws, splits,
or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code except

three feet of any bearing wall that might thereby be weakened.
11.Â Â Â Jointing. Fittings, type of joint and jointing material shall be
compatible with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
12.Â Â Â Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
13.Â Â Â Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any residence,
business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06Â Â Â INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Grease, oil, sludge, and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and service
stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand, or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required,
such interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
1.Â Â Â Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity as
specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent, and
shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.
2.Â Â Â Construction Standards. The interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
3.Â Â Â Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at the
ownerâ€™s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at all
times.
96.07Â Â Â SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the â€œYâ€
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located â€œYâ€ branch is available, a saddle â€œYâ€ shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendentâ€™s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08Â Â Â INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09Â Â Â PROPERTY OWNERâ€™S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
96.10Â Â Â ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines, whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the ownerâ€™s expense, within 30 days after date of
official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time, the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

97.05Â Â Â RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
1.Â Â Â Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
2.Â Â Â Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
3.Â Â Â Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
4.Â Â Â Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06Â Â Â SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of

wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâ€™s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08Â Â Â TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

Â 
100.01Â Â Â WATER DISCHARGE INTO SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
The discharge of water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile,
or swimming pool or other natural precipitation into the City sanitary sewer
system has the potential to cause damage to residential property and overload
the Wastewater Treatment Facility. Such damage can be caused by the backup of
sewage into the living quarters of residential homes creating a potential
health hazard and exceeding the capacity of the Wastewater Treatment Facility.
The City, therefore, finds it essential to maintenance of health, minimization
of damage to property, and to maintain the life and capacity of the Wastewater
Treatment Facility that the provisions of this chapter be strictly enforced to
avoid and minimize these problems in the future.
100.02Â Â Â RESTRICTIONS AND DEFINITIONS.
No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile, swimming
pool, or other natural precipitation shall be discharged into the City sanitary
sewer system. Dwellings, including new housing construction or houses under
construction, and other buildings and structures which require, because of the
infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces and the like, a seepage
collection system or sump pump system to discharge water, shall have a
permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time discharge
water into the sanitary sewer collection system. A permanent installation shall
be one which provides for a year-round discharge connection to the City storm
sewer system. If there is no storm drain available, the surface discharge point
shall be located no closer than four feet from the curb or as approved by the
City. It shall consist of a rigid discharge line inside the structure, without
a valve or quick connection for altering the path of discharge and, if
connected to the Cityâ€™s storm sewer line, include a check valve.
100.03Â Â Â SUMP, PUMP, AND RIGID PIPE METHOD OF INSTALLATION.
The following method of installation shall be used for sump, pump and rigid
pipe:
1.Â Â Â A discharge pipe shall be installed through the outside foundation wall of
the building with rigid pipe (plastic, copper, or galvanized) one inch inside
diameter minimum, without a valve or quick connection that would alter the path
of discharge. The discharge shall be directed away from the foundation wall.
2.Â Â Â No discharge shall be directed so as to impact neighboring properties or
any sidewalks.
3.Â Â Â Where a sump pit exists in any building it shall have a pump installed
with rigid piping as specified above.
4.Â Â Â Any plumber or contractor who knowingly installs a sump, pump, and/or
piping that is not in conformance with this chapter shall be liable to the City
for all damages that arise and be subject to penalties set forth in Section
100.07 of this chapter.
100.04Â Â Â DISCONNECTIONS ORDERED.
Any person, firm, or corporation having a roof, surface, ground, sump pump,
footing tile, or swimming pool now connected and/or discharging into the City
sanitary sewer system shall disconnect and/or remove the same. Any disconnects
or openings in the City sanitary sewer shall be closed or repaired in a manner
as approved by the Superintendent or his or her representative.
100.05Â Â Â INSPECTIONS.
Every person, firm, or corporation owning improved real estate or contractors/
builders who are building a house or other structure within the corporate
limits of the City that discharges into the Cityâ€™s sanitary sewer system or on
the ground shall allow an employee of the City or their designated
representative to inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump
or other prohibited discharge into the City sanitary sewer system. This
requirement may also be met by having the property owner contract with a
licensed plumber to perform the inspection. The plumber must inspect the
property and the sump pump system and complete and return an inspection form
provided by the City documenting the results of the inspection. All costs
associated with an inspection by a privately retained plumber shall be the
responsibility of the property owner. Any property owner or contractor/builder
of a new home refusing to allow their property to be inspected within 30 days
of the date City employees or their designated representatives have requested
admittance to the property shall immediately become subject to the penalties
stated in Section
100.07 of this chapter.

meter at any given location shall pay the monthly service charge for each
meter.
4.Â Â Â Reconnection Fees. Customers whose service has been disconnected either by
said customersâ€™ orders or by reason of delinquency and who request a
reconnection of such service within 12 months of the time of disconnection
shall be charged a reconnection fee equal to the sum of the monthly minimum
charges for the period of disconnection. In no case, however, shall any
reconnection fee be less than the sum of three monthly minimum charges.
5.Â Â Â Purchased Power Cost Adjustment. To compensate for monthly changes in the
Cityâ€™s cost of purchased power, a Purchased Power Cost Adjustment (PPCA) may be
applied to all energy (kWh) sold each month. The PPCA will be calculated by
comparing the actual purchased power cost on a 12 month rolling basis to the
then-current budgeted â€œbaseâ€ cost of purchased power contained in the Cityâ€™s
annual Municipal Electric Department budget.
Calculation of the monthly PPCA will be as follows:
PPCA (mils) = (Rolling 12 month Average Net Power Cost in mils) â€“ (Base Power
Cost in mils)
Terms defined as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Rolling 12 Month Average Net Power Cost. The rolling 12 month average
net power cost will be calculated by summing the net power cost for the
preceding 12 month period and dividing by the total purchased kWh for the same
period.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Net Power Cost. Net power cost is equal to the total NIMECA bill less
the â€œCTS Improvement Fundâ€ and the â€œProduction Improvement Investmentâ€ line
items on the NIMECA bill, plus the fuel and operating costs associated with
Cityâ€™s ownership interest in the Walter Scott Unit 4 power plants.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Base Power Cost. The base power cost will be established at the
beginning of each fiscal year and will equal the budgeted net power cost per
kWh contained in the cash flow projection for the fiscal year.

NONCONFORMITIES
165.06Â Â Â NONCONFORMITIES.
Within the districts established by this chapter there exist:
1.Â Â Â Lots,
2.Â Â Â Structures,
3.Â Â Â Uses of land and structures, and
4.Â Â Â Characteristics of use,
which were lawful before these regulations were adopted or amended, but which
are prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or
future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. Further nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district; however, it is the intent of this chapter to
allow structures which were nonconforming under the previous chapter, but which
are conforming under this chapter to be considered legal as of the date of
adoption of this chapter and shall be allowed to be rebuilt, added to, or
modified within the terms and requirements of this chapter.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has
been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction,
provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
165.07Â Â Â NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of the chapter. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, if the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be
obtained only through the action of the Board of Adjustment.
165.08Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY).
Where at the time of adoption of this chapter lawful use of land exists which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where
such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding
$1,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided:
1.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of these regulations.
2.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period
of 12 months, then any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is
located.
4.Â Â Â No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter
shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
165.09Â Â Â NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of these regulations by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
1.Â Â Â No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in such a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
2.Â Â Â Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure
be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever,
it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved.
165.10Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of
$1,000.00 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be
allowed in the district under the terms of these regulations, the lawful use
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions.
1.Â Â Â No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
2.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any
land outside such building.
3.Â Â Â If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to
another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of
Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
5.Â Â Â When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months or for 18
months during any three-year period (except when government action impedes
access to the premises) the structure, or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
6.Â Â Â When nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the
replacement cost at time of destruction. Replacement shall begin within six
months of the time of destruction or the nonconforming status shall expire.
Said construction shall also be completed within 18 months of the time of
destruction or the nonconforming status shall expire.
165.11Â Â Â REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may
be done on ordinary repairs, provided that the cubic content of the building as
it existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter shall not be
increased.
165.12Â Â Â USES UNDER SPECIAL EXCEPTION PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES.
Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms
of this chapter (other than a change through Board of Adjustment action from a
nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall
not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further
action be considered a conforming use.
ZONING ADMINISTRATOR
165.13Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
A Zoning Administrator designated by the City Council shall administer and
enforce these regulations. The Administrator may be provided with the
assistance of such other persons as the City Council may direct.
165.14Â Â Â ZONING/BUILDING PERMITS REQUIRED.
No building, fence, sidewalk or other structure or portion thereof shall be
erected, moved, demolished, or added to, without a zoning/building permit
therefor issued by the Zoning Administrator. No zoning/building permit shall be
issued except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, except after
written order from the Board of Adjustment. Fees for zoning/building permits
shall be as provided by Council resolution. Zoning/building permits shall be
applied for with the Zoning Administrator and shall expire two years after the
date of issuance if work is begun within 180 days of issuance or after 180 days
if no substantial beginning of construction has occurred. Extensions of time
may be granted in writing by the Zoning Administrator for good cause.
165.15Â Â Â RESIDENTIAL DWELLING STANDARDS.
All single-family dwelling units shall meet the following minimum standards:
1.Â Â Â The minimum dwelling width shall be 22 feet at the exterior dimension.

filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. It shall be the
responsibility of the appellant to record said action and all corresponding
stipulations and further said action shall take effect upon the Board receiving
sufficient confirmation of the same. A copy of said action shall also be filed
in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
165.19Â Â Â BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT; POWERS AND DUTIES.
The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
1.Â Â Â Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of these regulations.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any
officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected by any decision of
the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 10 days by filing
with the Zoning Administrator, and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying
the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is
taken.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
and give not less than seven days nor more than 20 days public notice in a
paper of general circulation in the City thereof, and decide the same within 30
days. At said hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal
is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the Notice of Appeal is
filed with the Administrator, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in the Administratorâ€™s opinion, cause imminent peril
to life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed other than
by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a
court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator from whom
the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
2.Â Â Â Special Exceptions: Conditions Governing Applications; Procedures. To hear
and decide only such special exceptions as the Board of Adjustment is
specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of these regulations; to decide
such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should
be granted; and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards
as are appropriate under this chapter, or to deny special exceptions when not
in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. A special exception
shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a special exception is submitted indicating
the section of this chapter under which the special exception is sought and
stating the grounds on which it is requested.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the special
exception, and give not less than seven days nor more than 20 days public
notice in a paper of general circulation in the City thereof, and decide the
same within 30 days.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by
agent or attorney.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that it is empowered under
the section of this chapter described in the application to grant the special
exception, that the granting of the special exception will not adversely affect
the public interest.
3.Â Â Â Variance, Conditions Governing Application; Procedures. To authorize upon
appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will
not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be
granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
No nonconforming use of neighboring, lands, structures, or buildings in the
same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of land, structures, or
buildings in other districts may be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the variance,
and give not less than seven days nor more than 20 days public notice in a
paper of general circulation in the City thereof, and decide the same within 30
days.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Public Hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by
agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make findings that requirements of
Section
165.18 have been met by the applicant for a variance.
In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and
punishable under this chapter. The variance shall become effective upon
receiving in the office of the County Recorder and the copy filed with the City
Clerk. These recording costs shall be paid for by the applicant.
Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance to allow
a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved
or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter
in said district.
E.Â Â Â The concurring vote of the majority of the members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the
Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon
which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in
the application of this chapter.
165.20Â Â Â APPEALS FROM THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT

the City, or other areas subject to this chapter aggrieved by any decision of
the Board of Adjustment may seek review by a court of record of such decision,

of the Code of Iowa.
DISTRICT REGULATIONS
165.21Â Â Â DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
The City is herewith divided into the following districts:
AGÂ Â Â Agricultural District
RSÂ Â Â Residential Single-Family District
RMÂ Â Â Residential Multi-Family District
MHÂ Â Â Mobile Home District
ACÂ Â Â Arterial Commercial District
BCÂ Â Â Central Business Commercial District
LIÂ Â Â Light Industrial District
HIÂ Â Â Heavy Industrial District
These districts are established as identified on the Official Zoning Map which,
together with all explanatory matters thereon, is hereby adopted by reference
and declared to be part of this chapter.
165.22Â Â Â AG â€“ AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
1.Â Â Â Intent. This district is intended to provide for areas in which
agriculture and related uses are encouraged as the principal use of land.
However, uses which may be offensive to the surrounding area or to the
community as a whole by reasons of noise, dust, smoke, odor, traffic, or
physical appearance or other similar factors are not permitted. The district
prohibits urban density residential use until these areas may be served by
utilities and services of the City. This district is also intended to preserve
land suited for eventual development into other uses, pending proper timing for
economical and practical provisions of streets, utilities, schools, and other
facilities so that reasonably compact development will occur and the fiscal
integrity of the City is preserved. All newly annexed areas to the City will
automatically be placed into this district classification unless otherwise

ADMINISTRATION
165.31Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION.
All questions of interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the
Zoning Administrator, or that personâ€™s assistant, and such questions shall be
presented to the Board of Adjustment only on appeal from the decision of the
Zoning Administrator, and recourse from the decisions of the Board of
Adjustment shall be to the courts as provided by law and particularly by
Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa.
165.32Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries may, from time to time, be
amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed, provided that at least
seven daysâ€™ notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in
a paper of general circulation in the City. In no case shall the notice be
published more than 20 days prior to the hearing.
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries may, from time to time, be
amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed. Notwithstanding Section
414.2, as a part of an ordinance changing land from one zoning district to
another zoning district or an ordinance approving a site development plan, the
Council may impose conditions on a property owner which are in addition to
existing regulations if the additional conditions have been agreed to in
writing by the property owner before the public hearing required under this
section or any adjournment of the hearing. The conditions must be reasonable
and imposed to satisfy public needs which are directly caused by the requested
change. In case, however, of a written protest against a change or repeal which
is filed with the City Clerk and signed by the owners of 20 percent or more of
the area of the lots included in the proposed change or repeal, or by the
owners of 20 percent or more of the property which is located within 200 feet
of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the change or repeal is
proposed, the change or repeal shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the Council. The
protest, if filed, must be filed before or at the public hearing.
Proposed amendments not recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
become effective only upon a favorable vote of three-fourths of the members of
the City Council. All zoning amendment application forms shall be approved by
resolution of the City Council.
165.33Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with grants of variances or special exceptions) shall constitute a misdemeanor.
Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $100.00 or be
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
City from taking such other legal action as is necessary to prevent any
violation.
165.34Â Â Â SCHEDULE OF FEES, CHARGES, AND EXPENSES.
The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses and
a collection procedure for zoning district changes, zoning permits, appeals,
and other matters pertaining to this chapter. The schedule of fees shall be
posted in the office of the Zoning Administrator, and the City Clerk, and may
be altered or amended only by the City Council, as recommended by the Planning
and Zoning Commission. Until all applicable fees, charges, and expenses have
been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any application or appeal.
165.35Â Â Â COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs, or is alleged to have occurred,
any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint, stating fully the
causes and basis thereof, shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. The
Administrator shall record properly such complaint, immediately investigate,
and take action thereon as provided by this chapter.

enclosure, shelter, or protection of persons, animals, chattels, or property of
any kind.
4.Â Â Â â€œBuilding lineâ€ means a line established on a plat as a restrictive
covenant, beyond which no building may be placed. The building lines need not
correspond to the front, side, or rear yard requirement established in the
Zoning Regulations in
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances and where they do not, the most
restrictive requirement will control.
5.Â Â Â â€œClerkâ€ means the person designated by the Council to furnish assistance

170.05Â Â Â PLAT APPROVAL AND ACCEPTANCE.
Procedures for plat approval and acceptance are as follows:
1.Â Â Â Preliminary Approval by Commission. Whenever the owner of any tract or
parcel of land is required by law to secure the approval of the Commission or
of the Council to any plat or subdivision, said owner shall file said
preliminary plat together with any other required information, with the Clerk.
Said plat and other information shall be referred by the Clerk to the
Commission for its preliminary study and approval. Such preliminary plat shall
contain such information and data as outlined in Section
170.06(1).
2.Â Â Â Study of Preliminary Plat by the Commission. The Commission shall study
such preliminary plat and other information submitted to see if it conforms
with the requirements of this chapter and shall approve or reject such plat and
plan within 30 days after the date of the submission thereof to the Commission.
The approval of the preliminary plat and plan constitutes authorization to
proceed with the preparation of the final plat, but the final plat must be
submitted to the Commission and the Council for approval as provided in the
following subsection.
3.Â Â Â Final Plat of Subdivision. The subdivider shall also file with the Clerk
for submission to the Commission, for its approval or rejection, the final plat
and plan of the subdivision which shall contain the data and information
outlined in Section
170.06(2) of this chapter. If the Commission approves the final plat and plan,
such approval and the date thereof shall be noted on the plat and plan over the
signatures of both the Chairperson and the Secretary of the Commission.
4.Â Â Â Approval by the Council. After the approval of the final plat and plan by
the Commission, it shall be submitted to the Council for final approval and for
acceptance of all easements, parks, or other areas preserved for or dedicated
to the public.
5.Â Â Â Approval by the Council after the Disapproval of the Commission. If the
Commission does not approve the final plat and plan of the subdivision, the
Council may approve said plat and plan and accept the streets, alleys,
easements, parks, or other areas preserved for or dedicated to the public by
said plat or plan, only by a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the entire membership of
the Council.
6.Â Â Â Filing in Office of Clerk. After approval of the final plat and plan by
the Council, two copies of such final plat and plan shall be filed in the
office of the Clerk.
170.06Â Â Â INFORMATION REQUIRED IN PLATS.
Plat information requirements are as follows:
1.Â Â Â Preliminary Plat. The preliminary plat shall provide enough detail to
allow for an understanding of the proposed development. Drawings shall show the
proposed location and width of streets, lot lines, building lines, and areas of
each proposed lot. The plat shall also show surrounding streets, lots, water
courses, sewers, and water mains. Wherever the land is so rolling or rugged
that the preliminary location and grades of streets and sewers cannot be
properly considered without the aid of a topographical map, the Commission may
require the developer to provide a topographical map of the property showing
contour intervals of not less than five feet. Any plat not containing all
information specified above shall not be considered by the Commission. The
Commission reserves the right to request any additional information necessary
to make a determination of the feasibility of the proposed plat.
2.Â Â Â Final Plat. The final map on a reproducible original (mylar) and two
prints thereof shall be submitted to the Commission. It shall show:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The boundaries of the property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The lines of all proposed streets and alleys, with their widths and
names, and any areas intended to be dedicated to public use; the names of the
streets shall be a continuation of the existing method of naming streets in the
City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The lines of adjoining streets and alleys, with their widths and names.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All lot lines, building lines, and easements, with figures showing
their dimensions.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All dimensions, both linear and angular, necessary for locating
boundaries of the subdivided area or of the lots, streets, alleys, easements,
and building line setbacks, and any other similar public or private uses. The
linear dimensions shall be expressed in feet and decimals of a foot.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Radii, arcs, and chords, points of tangency, central angles for all
circulinear streets, and radii for all rounded corners.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â All monuments, together with their description. (See Section
170.13 for details).

zoning law, and name of subdivider and of registered land surveyor staking the
lots.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Profiles may be required of any streets.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Any private restrictions shall be shown on the plat or reference made
to them thereon; and plats shall contain proper acknowledgments of owners and
mortgagees accepting said platting and restrictions.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â A filing fee of $100.00 shall be required to cover processing costs.
170.07Â Â Â ATTACHMENTS TO PLAT.
Final plats shall be accompanied by the following documents:
1.Â Â Â A statement by the owner and spouse, if any, that the subdivision is with
the ownersâ€™ free consent and is in accordance with the desire of the owners.
This statement must be signed and acknowledged by the owner and spouse before
some officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of deeds.
2.Â Â Â A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment
of deeds.
3.Â Â Â An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of title of
the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the proprietors
and holders of mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances on the land being
platted and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing the
encumbrances.
4.Â Â Â Resolution and certificate for approval by the Council and signature of
the Mayor and Clerk.
5.Â Â Â A certificate of the County Treasurer that the land is free from certified
taxes and certified special assessments or that the land is free from certified
taxes and that the certified special assessments are secured by bond in
compliance with Section 354.12 of the Code of Iowa.
6.Â Â Â A statement of restrictions of all types that run with the land and become
covenants in the deeds of lots.
170.08Â Â Â DESIGN STANDARDS ARE MINIMUM.
The standards and details herein contained are intended only as minimum
requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a subdivision may be
adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. In the design and development of
the subdivision, however, the subdivider shall use standards consistent with
the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant, and durable
neighborhood.
170.09Â Â Â MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT.
No preliminary or final plat or plan of a subdivision shall be approved by
either the Commission or by the Council unless it conforms to the minimum
standards and requirements contained in this chapter.
1.Â Â Â Acre Subdivision. Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one or
more acres and there are indications that such lots will eventually be
subdivided into small building plots, consideration must be given to the street
and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional streets can
be opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
2.Â Â Â Relation to Adjoining Street System. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where
adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for
public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall not be
less than the minimum street widths established herein. The street and alley
arrangement must also be such as to cause no hardship to owners of adjoining
property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient
access to it. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley
shall be platted.
3.Â Â Â Streets in Relation to Railroads. When the area to be subdivided adjoins a
railroad right-of- way, no street shall be dedicated which is parallel or
approximately parallel to the railroad, unless it is 100 feet or more from the
line of the railroad right-of-way.
4.Â Â Â Street Right-of-way Width. The minimum width of street right-of-ways shall
be 66 feet.
5.Â Â Â Street Width. The minimum width of streets shall be 33 feet, except in
those cases where topographical conditions, existing streets, or special
conditions make a street of less width more suitable. Under these conditions
the Commission may waive the minimum requirements.
6.Â Â Â Street Jogs at Intersections. At street intersections, street jogs with
centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited, except where
topographic or other physical conditions make such jogs unavoidable.
7.Â Â Â Street Angles at Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly at right
angles as possible.
8.Â Â Â Dead-end Streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited except where a street is
planned to continue past the subdividerâ€™s property. A dead-end street shall
terminate in a temporary circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of 90
feet, unless the Commission approves an equally safe and convenient space. The
length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured along its centerline from the turn-
around to the intersecting point.
9.Â Â Â Alleys. The minimum width of an alley shall be 30 feet (alleys are not
recommended for residential districts except under unusual conditions).
10.Â Â Â Easements Where There Are No Alleys. Where alleys are not provided,
nonbuildable easements of not less than 12Â½ feet in width shall be provided on
each side of all rear lot lines and on those side lines where necessary for
poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water, and heat mains.
Easements of greater width may be required along lines or across lots where
necessary for the extension of main sewers and similar utilities.
11.Â Â Â Width of Blocks. The width of blocks shall not be less than 200 feet and
not more than 300 feet, except that when such requirement would entail unusual
and substantial difficulties or hardship or when it is desired to provide a
development containing large residential lots, the Commission and the Council
may modify such requirements and allow the subdivider to plat blocks of other
widths.
12.Â Â Â Lot Lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation of this rule
will give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
13.Â Â Â Size and Shape of Lots. The minimum dimensions for lots shall be 66 feet
for width and 100 feet for depth, and in no case shall a lot that is to be used
for residential purposes contain less area than is required by the lot area
regulation of the zoning district in which the property is located. In laying
out an arrangement of lots, the subdivider should, whenever possible, arrange
for wide, shallow lots and avoid long, narrow lots.
14.Â Â Â Corner Lots. All corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit
the maintenance of building lines on both the front end and side streets as
required by any applicable zoning regulations.
15.Â Â Â Building Lines. Building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential use of any character, and on commercial lots immediately adjoining
residential areas. Such building lines shall not be less than required by any
applicable zoning regulations.
16.Â Â Â Character of Development. The Commission shall confer with the subdivider
regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the
subdivision, and may require that certain minimum deed restrictions be placed
upon the property, which restrictions would prevent such construction which
would clearly depreciate the character and value of adjoining property. The
Commission may also require that the deed restrictions provide for the creation
of a property ownersâ€™ association which would be responsible for the
enforcement of the restrictions and for the protection and improvement of the
general welfare of the subdivision.
17.Â Â Â Improvements. Before any portion of the final plat of any subdivision is
finally approved for recording, the subdivider shall make and install
improvements as required in paragraphs A - I of this subsection, in that
portion of the plat which is to be finally recorded. In lieu of final
completion of the minimum improvements before the plat is finally approved, the
subdivider may post a bond, approved by the City Attorney, with the City, which
bond will insure to the City that the improvements will be completed by the
subdivider within one year after final approval of the plat. The amount of the
bond shall be not less than the estimated cost of the improvements, and the
amount of the estimate must be approved by a registered engineer. If the
improvements are not completed within the specified time, the Council may use
the bond or any necessary portion thereof to complete the same.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Grading and Improving Streets. The subdivider shall grade and improve
all streets and alleys (if any) within the subdivision. The surfacing of such
streets and alleys shall be done by the City, at City expense, and shall be of
such character as is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with
similar improvements in the surrounding areas, but in no case shall it consist
of less than a minimum granular base of six inches of crushed rock. The street
design shall be according to grade and shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains,
and bridges. The design and specifications for all road pavement, shoulders,
drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall
be approved by the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Grading and Improving Lots. The subdivider shall, whenever necessary,
grade any portion of the property subdivided into lots so that each lot that is
to be offered for sale will be usable and suitable for the erection of
residential or any structure thereon.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Sanitary Sewers. The subdivider shall install sanitary sewers and
provide a connection for each lot. Such installations shall be in accordance
with good engineering practices, shall be in compliance with City ordinance,
shall be shown on plats drawn by a registered engineer and shall meet the
sanitation provisions of the City, County, State Health Department, and the
State Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Storm Sewers. When deemed necessary by the Commission, the developer
shall install a storm sewer adequate to serve the platted area. The design of
the storm sewer system shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Water Mains. The City agrees to furnish materials necessary and to
install water mains and fire hydrants in the subdivided area. Such
installations shall also include service lines from the main to the curb stop.
Water service lines to the building served shall be constructed in accordance
with
Chapter 90 of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Other Improvements. Extension of electric and gas service to the
subdivision will be completed by the City. It is also desirable to install
other improvements such as sidewalks, telephone and cable lines, and similar
facilities in any subdivision. Whenever the Commission deems it necessary, they
may require that such improvements shall be installed before the plat is
approved.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Trees. The subdivider may plant trees in subdivisions whenever there
are no existing woodlands. In order to protect sidewalks, sewers and water
mains, the Commission may prevent the planting of trees on the parking area and
certain species that are subject to disease or pests or which may eventually
become nuisances because of the growth of their roots in the service utilities.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Sump Pumps. Where storm sewers are required, all lots adjacent thereto
shall be provided with connections for sump pumps to the main, prior to
approval of any plat. The inlet for such connections shall be installed on each
lot and not in the right-of-way. The location of such connections shall be
shown on either the preliminary or final plat.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Curb and Gutter Improvements. After sewer, water and other utilities to
be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed, the
subdivider shall construct curbs and gutters.
170.10Â Â Â INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The City shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The subdivider shall
furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the commencement of
any and all construction, and notify the City not less than 24 hours in advance
of readiness for required inspections.
170.11Â Â Â MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The subdivider shall be required to maintain all improvements on the individual
subdivided lots until acceptance of said improvements by the Council.
170.12Â Â Â UTILITIES.
The following shall apply to the provision of utilities:
1.Â Â Â Location. The Council may require that all utility facilities, including,
but not limited to telephone and CATV cables, be located underground throughout
the subdivision. All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the
subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat. Underground service
connections to the street property line of each platted lot shall be installed
at the subdividerâ€™s expense. At the discretion of the Council, the requirement
for service connections to each lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots
to be retained in single ownership and intended to be developed for the same
primary use.
2.Â Â Â Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities.
Such easements shall be at least 12 1/2 feet wide. Proper coordination shall be
established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the
establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 12 1/2 feet in width shall be provided along side lot lines
with satisfactory access to the street or rear lot lines. Easements shall be
indicated on the plat.
170.13Â Â Â MONUMENTATION.
Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
1.Â Â Â The surveyor shall confirm the prior establishment of control monuments at
each controlling corner on the boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being
surveyed. If no control monuments exist, the surveyor shall place the
monuments. Control monuments shall be constructed of reasonably permanent
material solidly embedded in the ground and capable of being detected by
commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment. The surveyor shall affix a cap
of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed or stencil cut marking of the
Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the top of each monument which the
surveyor places.
2.Â Â Â Control monuments shall be placed at the following locations:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Each corner and angle point of each lot, block, or parcel of land
surveyed.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Each point of intersection of the outer boundary of the survey with an
existing or created right-of-way line of a street, railroad, or other way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Each point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve on
each right- of-way line established.
3.Â Â Â If the placement of a monument required by this section at the prescribed
location is impractical, a reference monument shall be established near the
prescribed location. If a point requiring monumentation has been previously
monumented, the existence of the monument shall be confirmed by the surveyor.
4.Â Â Â At least a minimum number of two survey control monuments are required to
be placed before the recording of a subdivision provided the surveyor includes
in the surveyorâ€™s statement a declaration that additional monuments shall be
placed before a date specified in the statement or within one year from the
date the subdivision is recorded, whichever is earlier.
170.14Â Â Â RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
1.Â Â Â Procedure for Resubdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plat legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.Â Â Â Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision
plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller
building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land
allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such
streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
170.15Â Â Â VARIATIONS.
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of this chapter would result in real difficulties and substantial
hardships, the Commission may vary or modify such requirements so that the
subdivider is allowed to develop the property in a reasonable manner, but at
the same time the public welfare and interests of the City are protected and
the general intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved.
170.16Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS, AND PENALTIES.
No plat or subdivision within the City shall be filed or recorded with the
County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any validity until it complies
with the provision of these regulations, has been approved by the Council as
herein set forth, and further:
1.Â Â Â Building Permits. The City shall not issue building or repair permits for
any structure located on a lot in any subdivision, the plat of which has been
prepared after the date of the adoption of this Code of Ordinances but which
has not been approved in accordance with the provisions contained herein. An
original tract may be divided into two lots or tracts and not be subject to the
provisions of this section. If an original tract shall be divided into more
than two lots or tracts after the date of the adoption of this Code of
Ordinances, no building or repair permits shall be issued for any structure
located or proposed to be located on any of such tracts or lots, unless or
until a plat as required by this chapter has been fully approved by the
Council.
2.Â Â Â Any person or entity who violates any provision of this chapter may, in
addition to other sanctions or remedies available, be cited for a municipal
infraction.
