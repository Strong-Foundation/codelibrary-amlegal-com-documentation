substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance
onto the land, into a water of the State or into the atmosphere which creates
an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])
   3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of substances that
presents a danger to the public health or safety and includes, but is not
limited to, a substance that is toxic, corrosive, or flammable, or that is an

listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under
section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended to January 1,

ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied
by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the

on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for

new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
   2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands
at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard, or driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   3.   Installation. The connection of the building sewer into the public
sewer shall conform to the requirements of Division 4, Plumbing Rules and
Regulations, of the State Building Code, applicable rules and regulations of
the City, or the procedures set forth in A.S.T.M. Specification C-12. All such

prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Superintendent
before installation.
   4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least ten
(10) feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be
less, provided the water service line is located at one side and at least
twelve (12) inches above the top of the building sewer.
   5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four (4) inches.
   6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line and at a uniform grade of not less than the following:

      D.   Deviations: any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only
with the written approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with
properly curved pipe and fittings.
   7.   Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
   8.   Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   9.   Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in Division 4 of the State
Building Code except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to

commensurate with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent.
   12.   Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six (6)
inches on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall
rest on firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06 INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
   Grease, oil, sludge and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and
service stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities
when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper

impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07 SEWER TAP.
   Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the
“Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a “Y” saddle shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued and attached with stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no time shall a
building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless special written
permission is received from the Superintendent and in accordance with the
Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08 INSPECTION REQUIRED.
   All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid under ground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09 PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
   All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
96.10 ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
   Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within thirty (30) days after date
of official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into sewers
for their maintenance and repair.
   12.   Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials or substances which
react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances which are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05 RESTRICTED DISCHARGES - POWERS.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under

flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary
treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at the owner’s expense.
97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES.
   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.

   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods of the Examination of
Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should
be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are
determined from periodic grab samples).

   The City of Ogden, Iowa (hereinafter referred to as “Grantor”), hereby
grants a non-exclusive franchise to Black Hills/Iowa Gas Utility Company, LLC
d/b/a Black Hills Energy, a Delaware limited liability corporation (hereinafter
called “Grantee”), its lessees, successors and assigns. This renews the
franchise previously granted by Ordinance No. 190. Grantee is hereby granted
the right, privilege, franchise, permission and authority to lay, construct,
install, maintain, operate and extend in, along, over, above or across the
present and future streets, alleys, avenues, bridges, public rights-of-way and
public easements as are now within the present or future limits of said
Grantor, a natural gas distribution system and all facilities necessary for the
purpose of supplying natural gas or processed gas and other operations
connected therewith or incident thereto for all purposes to the inhabitants of
said Grantor and consumers in the vicinity thereof, and for the distribution of
natural gas from or through said Grantor to points beyond the limits thereof.
Such facilities shall include, but not be limited to, all mains, services,
pipes, poles, communication devices, conduits and all other apparatus and
appliances necessary or convenient for transporting, distributing and supplying
natural gas for all purposes for which it may be used, and to do all other
things necessary and proper in providing natural gas service to the inhabitants
of Grantor and in carrying on such business.
110.02 TERM.
   The rights and privileges granted hereunder shall remain in effect for a
period of twenty five (25) years from the effective date of this ordinance. †
 
Notes
EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 270 granting a natural gas franchise to Black
  Hills/Iowa Gas Utility Company was adopted on July 11, 2023
110.03 FRANCHISE FEES OR TAXES.
   1.   Grantor hereby establishes a franchise fee on Grantee and on every
natural gas company and every other person, firm or corporation, their
successors and assigns, owning, operating, controlling, leasing or managing a
natural gas plant or system and/or generating, manufacturing, selling,
distributing or transporting natural gas (hereinafter referred to as “Energy
Providers,” each, individually, an “Energy Provider”).
   Energy Provider shall collect from their customers located within the
corporate limits of the Grantor as depicted on the Map (as defined below)
including the Grantor and pay to the City an amount equal to _one_ percent (1%)
of gross receipts Energy Provider derive from the sale, distribution or
transportation of natural gas delivered within the present limits of the
Grantor. Gross receipts as used herein are revenues received from the sale,
distribution or transportation of natural gas, after adjustment for the net
write-off of uncollectible accounts and corrections of bills theretofore
rendered.
   2.   The amount paid by Energy Provider shall be in lieu of, and Energy
Provider shall be exempt from, all other fees, charges, taxes or assessments
which the Grantor may impose for the privilege of doing business within the
Grantor, including, without limitation, excise taxes, [occupation taxes],
licensing fees, or right-of-way permit fees, and in the event the Grantor
imposes any such fee, charge, tax or assessment, the payment to be made by
Energy Providers in accordance with this ordinance shall be reduced in an
amount equal to any such fee, charge, tax or assessment imposed upon the Energy
Provider. Ad valorem property taxes imposed generally upon all real and
personal property within the Grantor shall not be deemed to affect Energy
Providers’ obligations under this ordinance.
   3.   Energy Provider shall report and pay any amount payable under this
ordinance on a monthly basis. Such payment shall be made no more than thirty
(30) days following the close of the period for which payment is due. Initial
and final payments shall be prorated for the portions of the periods at the
beginning and end of any franchise granted by the Grantor, Iowa, to an Energy
Provider.
   4.   Energy Provider shall list the franchise fee collected from customers
as a separate item on bills for utility service issued to their customers. If
at any time the Iowa Utilities Board or other authority having proper
jurisdiction prohibits such recovery, Energy Provider will no longer be
obligated to collect and pay the franchise fee until an alternate lawful
franchise fee can be negotiated and implemented. In addition, with prior
approval of Grantor, Energy Provider may reduce the franchise fee payable for
natural gas delivered to a specific customer when such reduction is required to
attract or retain the business of that customer.
   5.   Within ten (10) days of the date of this ordinance, the Grantor shall
provide the Energy Provider with a map of its corporate limits (the “Map”). The
Map shall be of sufficient detail to assist Energy Provider in determining
whether their customers reside within the Grantor’s corporate limits. The Map
shall serve as the sole basis for determining Energy Provider’s obligation
hereunder to collect and pay the franchise fee from customers; provided,
however, that if the Grantor’s corporate limits are changed by annexation or
otherwise, it shall be the Grantor’s sole responsibility to (a) update the Map
so that such changes are included therein, and (b) provide the updated Map to
the Energy Providers. An Energy Provider’s obligation to collect and pay the
franchise fee from customers within an annexed area shall not commence until
the later: (a) of sixty (60) days after such Energy Provider’s receipt from the
Grantor of an updated Map including such annexed area, or (b) such time after
such Energy Provider’s receipt from the Grantor of an updated Map including
such annexed area as is reasonably necessary for such Energy Provider to
identify the customers in the annexed area obligated to pay the franchise fee.
   6.   The City shall provide copies of annexation ordinances to Energy
Provider on a timely basis to ensure appropriate franchise fee collection from
customers within the corporate limits of the City as set forth in Subsection 4
above.
   7.   The Grantor shall have access to and the right to examine, during
normal business hours, Energy Provider’s books, receipts, files, records and
documents as is reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of payments due
hereunder; provided, that the Grantor shall not exercise such right more than
twice per calendar year. If it is determined that a mistake was made in the
payment of any franchise fee required hereunder, such mistake shall be
corrected promptly upon discovery such that any under-payment by an Energy
Provider shall be paid within thirty (30) days of recalculation of the amount
due, and any over-payment by an Energy Provider shall be deducted from the next
payment of such franchise fee due by such Energy Provider to the Grantor;
provided, that neither party shall have the obligation to correct a mistake
that is discovered more than one (1) year after the occurrence thereof.
110.04 GOVERNING RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The franchise granted hereunder is subject to all conditions, limitations
and immunities now provided for, or as hereafter amended, and applicable to the
operations of a public utility, by state or federal law. The rates to be
charged by Grantee for service within the present or future corporate limits of
Grantor and the rules and regulations regarding the character, quality and
standards of service to be furnished by Grantee, shall be under the
jurisdiction and control of such regulatory body or bodies as may, from time to
time, be vested by law with authority and jurisdiction over the rates,
regulations and quality and standards of service to be supplied by Grantee.
Provided however, should any judicial, regulatory or legislative body having
proper jurisdiction take any action that precludes Grantee from recovering from
its customers any cost associated with services provided hereunder, then
Grantee and Grantor shall renegotiate the terms of this ordinance in accordance
with the action taken. In determining the rights and duties of the Grantee, the
terms of this ordinance shall take precedence over any conflicting terms or
requirements contained in any other ordinance enacted by the Grantor.
110.05 PROVISION FOR INADEQUATE ENERGY SUPPLIES.
If an energy supplier is unable to furnish an adequate supply of energy due to
an emergency, an order or decision of a public regulatory body, or other acts
beyond the control of the Grantee, then the Grantee shall have the right and
authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations limiting, curtailing or
allocating extensions of service or supply of energy to any customers or
prospective customers, and withholding the supply of energy to new customers,
provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each
class of customers or prospective customers, and shall be non-discriminatory as
between communities receiving service from the Grantee.
110.06 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GRANTEE’S FACILITIES.
   Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up and any and all excavations
made shall be done in such a manner as to cause only such inconvenience to the
inhabitants of Grantor and the general public as is reasonably necessary, and
repairs and replacements shall be made promptly by Grantee, leaving such
properties in as good as condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
   Grantee agrees that for the term of this franchise, it will use its best
efforts to maintain its facilities and equipment in a condition sufficient to
meet the current and future energy requirements of Grantor, its inhabitants and
industries. While maintaining its facilities and equipment, Grantee shall
obtain permits as required by ordinance and will fix its excavations within a
commercially reasonable time period, except that in emergency situations
Grantee shall take such immediate unilateral actions as it determines are
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare; in which case,
Grantee shall notify Grantor as soon as reasonably possible. Within a
reasonable time thereafter, Grantee shall request and Grantor shall issue any
permits or authorizations required by Grantor for the actions conducted by
Grantee during the emergency situation.
   Grantor will give Grantee reasonable notice of plans for street improvements
where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved that affects
Grantee’s facilities. The notice shall contain the nature and character of the
improvements, the rights-of-way upon which the improvements are to be made, the
extent of the improvements, and the time when the Grantor will start the work,
and, if more than one right-of-way is involved, the order in which the work is
to proceed. The notice shall be given to the Grantee as soon as practical in
advance of the actual commencement of the work, considering seasonable working
conditions, to permit the Grantee to make any additions, alterations, or
repairs to its facilities.
110.07 EXTENSION OF GRANTEE’S FACILITIES.
   Upon receipt and acceptance of a valid application for service, Grantee
shall, subject to its own economic feasibility criteria as approved by the Iowa
Utilities Board make reasonable extensions of its distribution facilities to
serve customers located within the current or future corporate limits of
Grantor.
110.08 RELOCATION OF GRANTEE’S FACILITIES.
   If Grantor elects to change the grade of or otherwise alter any street,
alley, avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or public place for a public
purpose, unless otherwise reimbursed by federal, state or local legislative act
or governmental agency, Grantee, upon reasonable notice from Grantor, shall
remove and relocate its facilities or equipment situated in the public rights-
of-way, at the cost and expense of Grantee, if such removal is necessary to
prevent interference with Grantor’s facilities.
   If Grantor orders or requests Grantee to relocate its facilities or
equipment for the primary benefit of a commercial or private project, or as a
result of the initial request of a commercial or private developer or other
non-public entity, and such removal is necessary to prevent interference with
such project, then Grantee shall receive payment for the cost of such
relocation as a precondition to relocating its facilities or equipment.
   Grantor shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works
projects and exercising its authority under this section so as not to
arbitrarily cause Grantee unreasonable additional expense. If alternative
public right-of-way space is available, Grantor shall also provide a reasonable
alternative location for Grantee’s facilities. Grantor shall give Grantee
written notice of an order or request to vacate a public right-of-way;
provided, however, that its receipt of such notice shall not deprive Grantee of
its right to operate and maintain its existing facilities in such public right-
of way until it (a) if applicable, receives the reasonable cost of relocating
the same and (b) obtains a reasonable public right-of-way, dedicated utility
easement, or private easement alternative location for such facilities.
110.09 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Grantor acknowledges that certain information it might request from Grantee
pursuant to this ordinance may be of a proprietary and confidential nature, and
that such requests may be subject to the Homeland Security Act or other
confidentiality protections under state or federal law. If Grantee requests
that any information provided by Grantee to Grantor be kept confidential due to
its proprietary or commercial value, Grantor and its employees, agents and
representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of such information, to the
extent allowed by law. If Grantor is requested or required by legal or
administrative process to disclose any such proprietary or confidential
information, Grantor shall promptly notify Grantee of such request or
requirement so that Grantee may seek an appropriate protective order or other
relief.
110.10 FORCE MAJEURE.
   It shall not be a breach or default under this ordinance if either party
fails to perform its obligations hereunder due to force majeure. Force majeure
shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 1) physical events such as
acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, freezing, storms,
floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to
machinery, equipment or distribution or transmission lines; 2) acts of others
such as strikes, work-force stoppages, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars;
3) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order,
law, statute, ordinance, executive order, or regulation promulgated by a
governmental authority having jurisdiction; and (4) any other causes, whether
of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise not reasonably within the control of
the affected party to prevent or overcome. Each party shall make reasonable
efforts to avoid force majeure and to resolve such event as promptly as
reasonably possible once it occurs in order to resume performance of its
obligations hereunder; provided, however, that this provision shall not
obligate a party to settle any labor strike.
110.11 HOLD HARMLESS.
   Grantee, during the term of this ordinance, agrees to save harmless Grantor
from and against all claims, demands, losses and expenses arising directly out
of the negligence of Grantee, its employees or agents, in constructing,
operating, and maintaining its distribution and transmission facilities or
equipment; provided, however, that Grantee need not save Grantor harmless from
claims, demands, losses and expenses arising out of the negligence of Grantor,
its employees or agents.
110.12 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
   All rights, privileges and authority granted to Grantee hereunder shall
inure to the benefit of Grantee’s lessees, successors and assigns, subject to
the terms, provisions and conditions herein contained, and all obligations
imposed upon Grantee hereunder shall be binding upon Grantee’s lessees,
successors and assigns.
110.13 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.
   This ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the Grantor and
Grantee. No provision of this ordinance shall inure to the benefit of any third
person, including the public at large, so as to constitute any such person as a
third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms
hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action for any person not a
party hereto.
110.14 SEVERABILITY.
   If any clause, sentence or section of this ordinance is deemed invalid by
any judicial, regulatory or legislative body having proper jurisdiction, the
remaining provisions shall not be affected.
110.15 NON WAIVER.
   Any waiver of any obligation or default under this ordinance shall not be
construed as a waiver of any future defaults, whether of like or different
character.
110.16 REPEAL CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   This ordinance, when accepted by Grantee as provided below, shall constitute

ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.

chapter.
114.03 QUALIFICATIONS OF COMPANY AND GRANT OF AUTHORITY.
   The regulatory ordinance codified herein which grants to the company the
nonexclusive right to construct, operate and maintain a cable television system
in the City was passed and adopted by the Council after a full, open and public
proceeding. The proceeding was held after public notice was given and afforded
all interested parties the opportunity to comment upon the legal, character,
financial, technical and other qualifications of the company. Having received
at said proceeding all comments regarding the qualifications of the company,
the City found that the company possesses the necessary legal, technical,
character, financial and other qualifications and that the company’s
construction arrangements are adequate and feasible. Therefore, the City grants
to the company a nonexclusive franchise, right and privilege to construct,
erect, operate, modify and maintain in, upon, along, across, above and over and
under the highways, streets, alleys, sidewalks, public ways and public places
now laid out or dedicated and all extensions thereof, and additions thereto in
the City, poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other
television conductors and fixtures necessary for the maintenance and operation
in the City of a cable television system for the purpose of distributing
television and radio signals, and other electronic impulses in order to furnish
television and radio programs, and various communications and other electronic
services to the public. The right so granted includes the right to use and
occupy said streets, alleys, public ways and public places and all manner of
easements for the purposes set forth in this chapter.

   The franchise shall terminate twenty-five (25) years from the date of grant,
subject to renewal for periods of reasonable duration on the same terms and
conditions as contained in this chapter, or on such different or additional
terms and conditions as may be lawfully specified by the Council and as are
consistent with the requirements of Rule 76.31 of the FCC.
   The company’s application for franchise renewal shall be granted provided:
   1.   The company shows that its cable television service during the

interests of its service area; and
   2.   The company has not demonstrated a callous disregard of the law and all
pertinent regulations.
114.05 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED GENERALLY.

by the City and to such reasonable regulations as the City shall hereafter by

the system by the company shall be in full compliance with such portions of the
National Building and Electric Code as may be applicable and as the same may be
amended and revised from time to time, and in full compliance with all other

156.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in
Chapter 364, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to
exercise any power and perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City or of its residents,
and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of its residents.
   2.   Findings of Facts.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Ogden are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Department of Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect
and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Ogden and its
residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and
comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in Section 156.02(2)(A) of this ordinance with provisions designed
to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
156.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.  
   1.   Lands to Which Ordinance Apply. The provisions of this chapter shall

authorized shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance. The applicant shall
be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land
surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished
fill, building floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection
measures were accomplished in compliance with he provisions of this ordinance,
prior to the use or occupancy of any structure.
156.05 FLOODPLAIN MANGEMENT STANDARDS.
   1.   General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant
will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination.
   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the
proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where (i) the
bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than one hundred
(100) square miles, and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a
channel modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2
(1)b, Iowa Administrative Code.
      A.   All development within the special flood hazard areas shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0
ft. above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers or extended foundations may be allowed subject to
favorable consideration by the City Council), where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding.
      All new residential structures located in areas that would become
isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means
of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood.
However, this criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines
there is sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property.
When estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the
criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
      C.   Non-residential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.
When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
      D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
         (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the “lowest floor” (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            a.   A minimum of two (2) openings, with positioning on at least
two (2) walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
            b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
         Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access and low damage potential storage.
         (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (3)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating,
air conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case on non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation.
(Ord. 266 – Mar. 22 Supp.)
         (4)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
(Ord. 266 - Mar. 22 Supp.)
      E.   Factory-Built Homes.
         (1)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
         (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.

areas located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
      K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
         (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are
incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 sq. ft. in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than 1 foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
            b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
            c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
            d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
            e.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
            f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of 156.05(1)(D)(1) of this ordinance.
         (2)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
      L.   Recreational Vehicles.
         (1)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of 156.05
(1)(E) of this ordinance regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and,
            b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (2)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of 156.05(1)(E) of this ordinance regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
      M.   Pipeline River and Stream Crossings. Pipeline river and stream
crossings shall be buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently
protected to prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
      N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the elevation of
the 500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
156.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.  
   1.   The City Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this ordinance that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the City Council Shall be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinance and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
ordinance.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this ordinance. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this ordinance.
      E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
156.07 NONCONFORMING USES.  
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this ordinance, but which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, may be continued subject to
the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any
future use of the building premises shall conform to this ordinance.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
      C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty
(50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred,
unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude
its continued designation.
   2.   Except as provided in 156.05II(1)(B), any use which has been permitted
as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
156.08 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
    Violations of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with
any of the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates
this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 (five hundred dollars) or
imprisoned for not more than 30 (thirty) days. Nothing herein contained prevent
the City of Ogden from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy violation.
156.09 AMENDMENTS
   The regulations and standards set forth in this ordinance may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

165.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the
design, development and improvement of all new subdivisions and resubdivisions
so that existing developments will be protected and so that adequate provisions
are made for public services and to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare.
165.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and terms are defined:
   1.   “Building line” means a line between which and an abutting street or
public alley no buildings or structure may be erected.
   2.   “Metes and bounds” means the method used to describe a tract of land
intended to be used for dwelling or other purposes, so that it can be recorded
in the County Recorder’s office, as contrasted with the description of a part
of a properly approved and recorded subdivision plat by the lot and block
number.
   3.   “Plat” means a map, drawing, or chart of a subdivision.
   4.   “Subdivision” means the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land
into three (3) or more lots, plots, sites, or other divisions of land within
the City or within two (2) miles from the corporate limits of the City, for the
purpose of either immediate or future sale or of building development. It also
includes resubdivision of land or lots.
165.03 PLAT APPROVAL AND ACCEPTANCE.
   Procedures for plat approval and acceptance are as follows:
   1.   Preliminary Approval by Council. Whenever the owner of any tract or
parcel of land is required by law to secure the approval of the Council to any
plat or subdivision, said owner shall file ten (10) copies of said preliminary
plat together with any other required information, with the Clerk. Such
preliminary plat shall contain such information and data as outlined in Section
165.04(1).
   2.   Study of Preliminary Plat by the Council. The Council shall study such
preliminary plat and other information submitted to see if it conforms with the
requirements of this chapter and shall approve or reject such plat and plan
within sixty (60) days after the date of the submission thereof to the Council.
The approval of the preliminary plat and plan constitutes authorization to
proceed with the preparation of the final plat, but the final plat must be
submitted to the Council for approval as provided in the following section.
   3.   Final Plat of Subdivision. The subdivider shall also file with the
Clerk for submission to the Council, for its approval or rejection, ten (10)
copies of the final plat and plan of the subdivision which shall contain the
data and information outlined in Section 165.04(2) of this chapter.
   4.   Filing in Office of Clerk. After approval of the final plat and plan by
the Council, two (2) copies of such final plat and plan shall be filed in the
office of the Clerk.
165.04 INFORMATION REQUIRED IN PLATS.
   Plat information requirements are as follows:
   1.   Preliminary Plat. In seeking to subdivide land, the owner shall submit
ten (10) copies of a preliminary plat to the Council before submission of the
final plat. The preliminary plat shall be drawn to scale and shall show the
proposed location and width of streets, lot lines, building lines, and areas of
each proposed lot. The plat shall also show surrounding streets, lots, water
courses, sewers and water mains. The scale of such preliminary plat shall not
be less than one (1) inch to one hundred (100) feet. Wherever the land is so
rolling or rugged that the preliminary location and grades of streets and
sewers cannot be properly considered without the aid of a topographical map,
the Council may require the developer to provide a topographical map of the
property showing contour intervals of not less than five (5) feet. Any plat not
containing all information specified above shall not be considered by the
Council. A filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) is required to cover
processing costs.
   2.   Final Plat. The final map on a reproducible original (mylar) and ten
(10) prints thereof shall be submitted to the Council. It shall show:
      A.   The boundaries of the property.
      B.   The lines of all proposed streets and alleys, with their widths and
names, and any other areas intended to be dedicated to public use; the names of
the streets shall be a continuation of the existing method of naming streets in
the City.
      C.   The lines of adjoining streets and alleys, with their widths and
names.
      D.   All lot lines, building lines, and easements, with figures showing
their dimensions.
      E.   All dimensions, both linear and angular, necessary for locating
boundaries of the subdivided area or of the lots, streets, alleys, easements,
and building line setbacks, and any other similar public or private uses. The
linear dimensions shall be expressed in feet and decimals of a foot.
      F.   Radii, arcs, and chords, points of tangency, central angles for all
circulinear streets, and radii for all rounded corners.

      H.   Title and description of property subdivided, showing its location
and extent, points of compass, scale of plan, and name of subdivider and of
registered land surveyor staking the lots.
      I.   Profiles may be required of any streets.
      J.   Any private restrictions shall be shown on the plat or reference
made to them thereon; and plats shall contain proper acknowledgments of owners
and mortgagees accepting said platting and restrictions.
165.05 ATTACHMENTS TO PLATS.
   Final plats shall be accompanied by the following documents:
   1.   A statement by the owner and spouse, if any, that the subdivision is
with the owners’ free consent and is in accordance with the desire of the
owners. This statement must be signed and acknowledged by the owner and spouse
before some officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of deeds.
   2.   A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment
of deeds.
   3.   An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of title
of the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the proprietors
and holders of mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the land being platted
and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing the
encumbrances.
   4.   Resolution and certificate for approval by the Council and signature of
the Mayor and Clerk.

certified taxes and certified special assessments or that the land is free from
certified taxes and that the certified special assessments are secured by bond
in compliance with Section 354.12 of the Code of Iowa.
165.06 MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT.
   No preliminary or final plat or plan of a subdivision shall be approved by
the Council unless it conforms to the minimum standards and requirements
contained in this chapter.
   1.   Acre Subdivision. Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one
(1) or more acres and there are indications that such lots will eventually be
subdivided into small building plots, consideration must be given to the street
and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional streets can
be opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
   2.   Relation to Adjoining Street System. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where
adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for
public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall not be
less than the minimum street widths established herein. The street and alley
arrangement must also be such as to cause no hardship to owners of adjoining
property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient
access to it. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley
shall be platted.
   3.   Streets in Relation to Railroads. When the area to be subdivided
adjoins a railroad right of-way, no street shall be dedicated which is parallel
or approximately parallel to the railroad, unless it is one hundred (100) feet
or more from the line of the railroad right-of-way.
   4.   Street Right-of-way Width. The minimum width of street right-of-ways
shall be sixty-six (66) feet.
   5.   Street Width. The minimum width of streets shall be twenty (20) feet,
except in those cases where topographical conditions, existing streets, or
special conditions make a street of less width more suitable. Under these
conditions the Council may waive the minimum requirements.
   6.   Street Jogs at Intersections. At street intersections, street jogs with
centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be
prohibited, except where topographic or other physical conditions make such
jogs unavoidable.
   7.   Street Angles at Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly at
right angles as possible, and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle less than sixty (60) degrees.
   8.   Dead-end Streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited except where a street
is planned to continue past the subdivider’s property. A dead-end street shall
terminate in a temporary circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of
ninety (90) feet, unless the Council approves an equally safe and convenient
space. No dead-end street shall be longer than six hundred (600) feet in
length. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length and shall
be provided with a turn-around with a minimum right-of-way diameter of one
hundred thirty (130) feet. The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured along
its centerline from the turn-around to the intersecting point.
   9.   Alleys. The minimum width of an alley in a residential block shall be
twenty (20) feet (alleys are not recommended for residential districts except
under unusual conditions). Alleys will be required in the rear of all business
lots and shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide.
   10.   Easements Where There Are No Alleys. Where alleys are not provided,
easements of not less than ten (10) feet in width shall be provided on each
side of all rear lot lines and on those side lines where necessary for poles,
wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water, and heat mains.
Easements of greater width may be required along lines or across lots where
necessary for the extension of main sewers and similar utilities.
   11.   Length of Blocks. No blocks shall be longer than one thousand (1,000)
feet between street lines. Blocks over seven hundred fifty (750) feet in length
shall provide a cross walk near the center of the block. The right-of-way
through such blocks shall not be less than ten (10) feet in width.
   12.   Width of Blocks. The width of blocks shall not be less than two
hundred (200) feet and not more than three hundred (300) feet, except that when
such requirement would entail unusual and substantial difficulties or hardship
or when it is desired to provide a development containing large residential
lots, the Council may modify such requirements and allow the subdivider to plat
blocks of other widths.
   13.   Lot Lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation of this rule
will give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
   14.   Size and Shape of Lots. The minimum dimensions for lots shall be
sixty-six (66) feet for width and one hundred (100) feet for depth. In laying
out an arrangement of lots, the subdivider should, whenever possible, arrange
for wide, shallow lots and avoid long, narrow lots.
   15.   Corner Lots. All corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to
permit the maintenance of building lines on both the front end and side streets
as required by any applicable ordinances.
   16.   Building Lines. Building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential use of any character, and on commercial lots immediately adjoining
residential areas. Such building lines shall not be less than required by
applicable regulations for Restricted Residential Districts.
   17.   Character of Development. The Council shall confer with the subdivider
regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the
subdivision, and may require that certain minimum deed restrictions be placed
upon the property, which restrictions would prevent such construction which
would clearly depreciate the character and value of adjoining property. The
Council may also require that the deed restrictions provide for the creation of
a property owners’ association which would be responsible for the enforcement
of the restrictions and for the protection and improvement of the general
welfare of the subdivision.
   18.   Improvements. Before any portion of the final plat of any subdivision
is finally approved for recording, the subdivider shall make and install
improvements as required in subsection A-H of this subsection, in that portion
of the plat which is to be finally recorded. In lieu of final completion of the
minimum improvements before the plat is finally approved, the subdivider may
post a bond, approved by the City Attorney, with the City which bond will
insure to the City that the improvements will be completed by the subdivider
within one (1) year after final approval of the plan. The amount of the bond
shall be not less than the estimated cost of the improvements, and the amount
of the estimate must be approved by a registered engineer. If the improvements
are not completed within the specified time, the Council may use the bond or
any necessary portion thereof to complete the same.
      A.   Grading and Improving Streets. The subdivider shall grade and
improve all streets and alleys (if any) within the subdivision. The surfacing
of such streets shall consist of not less than six (6) inches of Portland
cement concrete. The street design shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer.
      B.   Grading and Improving Lots. The subdivider shall, whenever
necessary, grade any portion of the property subdivided into lots so that each
lot that is to be offered for sale will be usable and suitable for the erection
of residential or any structure thereon.
      C.   The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer mains and provide a
connection for each lot. Such installations shall be in accordance with good
engineering practices, shall be shown on plans drawn by a registered engineer
and shall meet the sanitation provisions of the City, County, State Health
Department and the State Department of Natural Resources.
      D.   Storm Sewers. Where deemed necessary by the Council, the developer
shall install a storm sewer adequate to serve the platted area. The design of
the storm sewer system shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer.
      E.   The subdivider shall install water mains and fire hydrants in the
subdivided area. Such installations shall be in accordance with the standards
and specifications of the City, City Water Department and the State Department
of Natural Resources, and fire hydrant locations should meet the approval of
the City Water Department and City Fire Chief. The design of the water mains
shall be certified by a registered professional engineer.
      F.   The subdivider shall install curb and gutter on all streets within
the subdivision. Curb and gutter shall be constructed of Portland cement
concrete. The design shall be certified by a registered professional engineer.
      G.   Other Improvements. It is also desirable to install other
improvements such as sidewalks, electric lines, street lights, gas mains and
similar facilities in any subdivision. Whenever the Council deems it necessary,
they may require that such improvements shall be installed before the plat is
approved. The Council may require that all utility lines except electric lines
of nominal voltage in excess of 15,000 volts, be installed underground. The
subdivider shall be responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the
utility companies for installation of such facilities. If overhead utility
lines or wires are permitted, they shall be placed in the easements provided in
the lots. In their determination on whether or not to require underground
utilities, the Council may consider that soil, topographical, or other
conditions make such installations within the subdivision unreasonable or
impractical. Utilities shall be provided in the lot easements wherever
possible. When it is necessary to install utilities in street rights-of-way,
the following requirements shall apply:
         (1)   Time of Completion. After grading is completed and approved and
before any pavement base is applied, all of the in-street underground work
(water mains, gas mains, etc., and all service connections) shall be completely
installed and approved through the length of the street and across the flat
section. Where the utility mains are outside the pavement area, the subdivider
may be allowed to omit the installation of service connections provided that at
such time as these service connections are needed, they may be jacked across
the street without breaking or weakening the existing pavement.
         (2)   Service Connections. Where rock is known to exist beneath the
pavement area and at such depth as to interfere with the jacking of service
connections, the complete installation of service connections before any base
is applied shall be required. In cases where underground utilities must be
provided within the right-of-way streets, they shall not be installed under the
paved portions of such streets.
      H.   The subdivider shall plant trees on the parkings in all streets in
subdivisions whenever there are no existing woodlands or as deemed necessary by
the commission. In order to protect sidewalks, sewers and water mains, the
Council may prevent the planting of certain species that are subject to disease
or pests or which may eventually become nuisances because of the growth of
their roots in the service utilities.
165.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   Enforcement provisions are as follows:
   1.   Filing of Plat. No plat of any subdivision within the City or within
two (2) miles of the corporate limits of the City, as provided in Chapter
354.9, Code of Iowa, shall be entitled to record in the County Recorder’s
office or have any validity until it shall have been approved in the manner
prescribed herein.
   2.   Building Permits. The Clerk shall not issue building or repair permits
for any structure located on a lot in any subdivision, the plat of which has
been prepared after the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this
chapter but which has not been approved in accordance with the provisions
contained herein. An original tract may be divided into two (2) lots or tracts
and not be subject to the provisions of this section. If an original tract
shall be divided into more than two (2) lots or tracts after the date of the
adoption of such ordinance, no building or repair permits shall be issued for
any structure located or proposed to be located on any of such tracts or lots,
unless or until a plat as required by this chapter has been fully approved by
the Council.
   3.   Public Improvements. The Council shall not permit any public
improvement over which it has any control to be made or any money expended for
improvements in any area that has been subdivided or upon any street that has
been platted after the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this
chapter unless such subdivision or street has been approved in accordance with
the provisions contained therein.
165.08 VARIATIONS.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is one such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of Section 165.06, subsections 2, 11, 12, 14 and 18 would result in
real difficulties and substantial hardships, the Council may vary or modify
such requirements so that the subdivider is allowed to develop the property in
a reasonable manner, but at the same time the public welfare and interests of
the City are protected and the general intent and spirit of this chapter are
preserved.
