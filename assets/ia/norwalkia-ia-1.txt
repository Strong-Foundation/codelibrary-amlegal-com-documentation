expiration of the ten-day reclaiming period.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.04 NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.
If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05 FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
The owner, lienholder or claimant shall pay all towing and storage fees as
established by the storage facility, whereupon the vehicle shall be released.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])

Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the expense
of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing and notification required, in
accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner of the motor
vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety (90) days, and then shall be
deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09 DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor vehicle
for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle or otherwise demolish such motor

Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances, to guarantee the payment of bills for
service.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
92.10 TEMPORARY VACANCY.
A property owner may request water service be temporarily discontinued and shut
off at the curb valve when the property is expected to be vacant for an
extended period of time. There shall be a fee, as established in
Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances, for shutting the water off at the curb
valve and for restoring service. During a period when service is temporarily
discontinued as provided herein there shall be no minimum service charge. The
City will not drain pipes or pull meters for temporary vacancies.
92.11 ADJUSTMENT TO CHARGES.
In the event that excessive water usage occurs by reason of malfunction,
accident or circumstances deemed to warrant reduction or adjustment of charges,
the Community Services Director, upon written application, may make such
adjustment to the combined service account as deemed fair and equitable. For
new construction, the Community Services Director has the authority to adjust
the charge to the contractor for water and minimum sewer charges.
92.12 WATER SHORTAGE.  
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for
systematically managing water demand through conservation measures and measures
designed to limit water use during a system constraint or drought related or
other shortage.
   2.   Definitions.
      A.   The Water Shortage Stages begin at State I (least restrictive) and
advance to Stage IV (most restrictive). The Stages become increasingly
restrictive for water usage in a response to the severity of the shortage.
      B.   Water Shortage: The Public Works Department will establish
departmental policies that define when the various stages are to be triggered.
These policies will serve as a general guide for water shortage stage
implementation. Water shortage steps may be skipped and policies adapted as
needed depending on conditions of the Norwalk Water System and weather
patterns.
   3.   General Prohibition.
      A.   No person shall cause, use, or permit the use of water from the City
water system in a manner contrary to any provision of this section.
      B.   No person shall cause, use, or permit the use of water from the City
water system in excess of any limit or in violation of any policy established
by the Public Works Director and Mayor as hereby authorized by the City
Council.
   4.   Authority. The Public Works Director may declare a Stage I or Stage II
shortage when an emergency shortage exists. The Mayor may declare a Stage III
or Stage IV shortage when an emergency shortage exists. The implementation of
the respective authority identified hereinabove. The implementation shall cease
upon a Declaration by the respective authority.
   5.   Water Emergencies.
      A.   Stage I: Voluntary 25% reduction in turf irrigation. Upon
declaration of a Stage I Water Shortage, the following restrictions shall apply
to the use of water from the City's water system: the City will increase public
communication and education efforts aimed at water conservation, will encourage
the community to conserve water wherever possible and otherwise promote the
efficient use of water. During a Stage I shortage, water customers are
encouraged, in addition to normal water conservation, to specifically follow
the voluntary water conservations measures set forth below:
         (1)   Request a city wide 25% reduction in lawn irrigation.
         (2)   Encourage customers to optimize their irrigation systems so
water is not directed onto impervious surfaces and turf is not overwatered.
         (3)   Recommend customers irrigate on alternate days, by a system
under which even numbered addresses water only on even days of the month, and
odd numbered addresses water only on odd numbered days of the month.
         (4)   Customers who irrigate should do so early in the morning, prior
to 6:00 am for less evaporation.
      Enforcement: There will be no enforcement at this stage.
      B.   Stage II: Voluntary 50% reduction in outdoor water use. Upon
declaration of a Stage II Water Shortage, the following restrictions shall
apply to the use of water from the City's water system: the City will increase
public communication and education efforts aimed at water conservation, will
encourage the community to conserve water wherever possible and otherwise
promote the efficient use of water. During a Stage II shortage, water customers
are encouraged, in addition to normal water conservation, to specifically
follow the voluntary water conservation measures set forth below:
         (1)   Request a city wide 50% reduction in outdoor water use.
         (2)   Remind customers to optimize their irrigation systems so water
is not directed onto impervious surfaces and turf is not overwatered.
         (3)   Reinforce the recommendation for customers to irrigate on
alternate days and early in the morning.
         (4)   Encourage wise use of water during outdoor activities including:
washing cars, playing in the sprinkler, playing with water toys, and filling
swimming pools.
         (5)   Encourage wise use of water indoors including: identifying and
repairing leaking fixtures, washing only full loads in dishwashers and washing
machines, and taking shorter showers.
         (6)   Suspend high water use, non-essential municipal operations.
      Enforcement: There will be no enforcement at this stage.
      C.   Stage III: Turf irrigation prohibited and no use of automatic
irrigation systems. Upon declaration of a Stage III Water Shortage, the
following restrictions shall apply to the use of water from the City's water
system: the City will increase public communication and education efforts aimed
at water conservation, will encourage the community to conserve water wherever
possible and otherwise promote the efficient use of water. During a Stage III
shortage, water customers are mandated, in addition to normal water
conservation, to specifically follow the mandatory water conservation measures
set forth below:
         (1)   All actions required in a Stage II Water Shortage, not in
conflict with these Stage III Actions.
         (2)   Require customers to further reduce water consumption by
suspending all turf irrigation and the use of all automatic irrigation systems.
      Enforcement: Customers observed by City personnel in violation of this
policy will be notified by a tag left on the property. If such activities are
not suspended within 48 hours, water service will be terminated and the
published termination fee, as determined in Chapter 177 of this Code of
Ordinances, will apply. Water service will be restored only upon receipt by the
City of Norwalk of an undertaking by the customer that the customer understands
and will comply with the mandatory conservation measures. Any subsequent
violations will result in further termination of service and will be deemed an
unauthorized use of water and shall be considered a repeat offense.
      D.   Stage IV: Mandatory water rationing. Upon declaration of a Stage IV
Water Shortage, the following restrictions shall apply to the use of water from
the City's water system: the City will increase public communication and
education efforts aimed at water conservation, will encourage the community to
conserve water wherever possible and otherwise promote the efficient use of
water. During a Stage IV shortage, water customers are mandated, in addition to
normal water conservation and to specifically follow the mandatory water
conservation measures set forth below:
         (1)   All actions required in a Stage II Water Shortage and a Stage
III Water Shortage not in conflict with these Stage IV Actions.
         (2)   Water rationing measures will be implemented and enforced by the
application of an Emergency Water Shortage Rate. In order to implement such a
rate, the Des Moines Water Works shall set a target level for demand consistent
with its current capacity and shall use such target to establish a Rationing
Factor. All customers will be asked to reduce their consumption to a level at
or below the Stage IV Monthly Water Ration amount and consumption above such
level, will be charged at the Emergency Water Shortage Rate intended to
accurately reflect the additional expense incurred by the City to deliver water
service to its citizens during the shortage.
      Enforcement: Stage IV Monthly Water Rationing means for each customer the
typical off-peak consumption of such customer multiplied by an announced
Rationing Factor. Typical off-peak consumption shall be computed as of the date
that the Stage IV is invoked as the mean monthly consumption of the customer
for the immediately preceding months of March, April, and May. The Rationing
Factor shall be a percentage as announced by Des Moines Water Works and
designed to effectively reduce consumption to the level as required by the
prevailing circumstances. While Stage IV is in effect, all water used beyond
the Stage IV Monthly Water Ration for each customer will be billed at the
Emergency Water Shortage Rate. Emergency Water Shortage Rate shall be four
times the rate otherwise applicable to each customer.
      Customers observed by City personnel in violation of this policy will be
notified by a tag left on the property. If such activities are not suspended
within 48 hours, water service will be terminated and the published termination
fee, as determined in Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances, will apply. Water
service will be restored only upon receipt by the City of Norwalk of an
undertaking by the customer that the customer understands and will comply with
the mandatory conservation measures. Any subsequent violations will result in
further termination of service and will be deemed an unauthorized use of water
and shall be considered a repeat offense.
   6.   Relief from Compliance.
      A.   Within 20 days after the date of a first notice violation, a person
may file an application for relief from any provision of this Ordinance. The
City Manager or his or her designee shall grant, conditionally grant, or deny
the application.
      B.   In determining whether to grant relief and the nature of any relief,
the City Manager or his or her designee shall take into consideration all
relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:
         (1)   Water uses during construction; and
         (2)   Adjustments to water use caused by emergency health or safety
hazards; and
         (3)   Alternative water reduction measures being proposed by the
applicant.

CHAPTER 94
BENEFITED WATER DISTRICTS
 
94.01 Purpose 94.03 Procedure
94.02 Intent  94.04 Northwest Service Area Benefited District
 
94.01 PURPOSE.
The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a procedure
to be utilized to recover the cost of design and construction of major water
main facilities in those instances in which a significant number of the
properties to be benefited by such facilities are not sufficiently developed to
permit the recovery of those costs through the special assessment process as
provided in Chapter 384, Division IV of the Code of Iowa. The City hereby
declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as herein provided, to recover
the costs for design and construction of such major water main facilities from
property owners who connect to such facilities subsequent to their
construction.
94.02 INTENT.
It is the intent of this chapter to set forth the method of recovery of
proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect their
properties to major water main facilities subsequent to their construction, so
that in the event that all property, other than street and road right-of-way,
which lies within the benefited district is connected to the major water main
facilities during their expected useful life, then those properties shall bear,
in the aggregate, up to 100 percent of the cost for design and construction of
such facilities, including legal, administrative, and interest expenses
associated therewith.
94.03 PROCEDURE.
   1.   In the event the Council determines the necessity for construction of a
major water main facility, and determines that the utilization of a connection
fee is the most equitable manner in which to recover the City’s costs
associated therewith, the Council shall cause a “Notice of Public Hearing on
the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish a Benefited District and a
Connection Fee Schedule” to be published in a newspaper of general circulation
within the City as hereinafter provided. In addition to indicating the date,
time, and place of the public hearing, the notice shall:
      A.   Indicate the nature and extent of the major water main facility or
facilities under consideration for construction, as well as the estimated cost
or costs for the design and construction of same;
      B.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district to
be served by the major water main facility or facilities; and
      C.   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by
property owners within the benefited district who connect to said facilities,
expressed in dollars per acre of land area served or such other method as the
City shall determine to be equitable for the benefited district.
The notice shall also state that the proposed connection fee ordinance is on
file, along with a plat of the area to be served, and both are available for
public inspection in the office of the Clerk. The notice shall be published not
more than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled date of the
public hearing, and shall be mailed to each property owner within the benefited
district as shown by the records of the County Auditor.
   2.   At the public hearing, the owners of property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
      A.   The necessity for the project;
      B.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major water
main facilities;
      C.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
      D.   The proposed connection fee.
   3.   Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
      A.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
      B.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major water main
facilities from the proposed project and the properties served thereby from the
benefited district proposed; or
      C.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.
   4.   The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the Council’s discretion,
that single family residences within the benefited district, in existence or
under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, and located within
the corporate limits of the City, are eligible for connection to the major
water main facility. In that event, the ordinance shall include the following
provisions:
      A.   That the owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major water
main facility upon approval of their application for connection, payment of the
connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at the owner’s expense, of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the City; and
      B.   That the owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major water
main facility upon approval of their application for connection, division of
said parcel into a residence parcel and a remainder parcel, payment of the
connection fee for the residence parcel, and construction, at the owner’s
expense, of appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the
City The connection fee for the remainder parcel shall be payable at such time
as the remainder parcel shall be connected to the major water main facility.
For purposes of this chapter, a parcel may be divided once. For purposes of
this section, division of the property into a residence parcel and a remainder
parcel may be accomplished by submitting a drawing showing a graphical
depiction of the two parcels including dimensions accurate to within a distance
of one-foot, a legal description of the entire parcel and a legal description
of the residence parcel with such accuracy as to allow the City to determine a
reasonable description of the remainder parcel. For purposes of this section,
the division of property does not require a subdivision of the property or a
plat of survey.
The connection fee ordinance may also provide, at the Council’s discretion,
that water service can be provided to recreational and park facilities and to
commercial and industrial parcels and facilities, in the same manner and under
the same procedures set forth in this section for single family residences
within the benefited district.
All other property located within the corporate limits of the City and within a
benefited district shall be eligible for connection to the major water main
facility upon approval of an application for connection by the owner thereof,
as hereinafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for such property,
provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for development, and,
where applicable, all water main improvements necessary to serve said property
have been constructed, at the owner’s expense, and accepted by the City.
   5.   After adoption, publication and recording by the Clerk of a connection
fee ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within
the benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major water
main facility, shall make application to the City for such connection. The
submittal of construction plans to the City for water main improvements on
property being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to
the City for purposes of this chapter. The water connection fee shall be due
and payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the
major water main facility. No connection shall be made to a major water main
facility until such application has been approved and until the required
connection fee has been paid. The water connection fee shall be paid before the
City will approve the final plat of property subject to the connection fee.
   6.   The water connection fee shall be in an amount equal to the maximum
acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof, within the benefited
district under common ownership which can be lawfully served through such
proposed connection, multiplied by the per-acre connection fee or such other
fee basis as determined for the benefited district established in the
connection fee ordinance for that benefited district. The connection fee
ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with annual interest
adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later years pay interest
on the connection fee for their property. The rate of interest applicable to
the connection fee established in each benefited district shall not exceed the
rate of interest applicable to special assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and
Section 384.60(3) of the Iowa Code in effect on the date that the connection
fee was established for that district by enactment of a connection fee
ordinance.
   7.   Property outside of the benefited district would be eligible for
connection to a major water main facility only upon the approval of an
application for connection by the owner thereof, a determination by the City
that sufficient capacity exists in the major water main facility to serve such
area outside of the boundaries of the benefited district and following payment
of a fee calculated on the same basis as if the property were located within
the benefited district. Without approval of the City and payment of the
applicable fee, no property outside of the benefited district may connect to
the major water main facility constructed to serve the benefited district. The
City may waive the requirement for payment of the applicable fee.
   8.   The water connection fee required by this chapter shall be due and
payable to the City and is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees
for connection required under the plumbing code or other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances.
   9.   In the event any property owner connects his or her property within a
benefited district or property outside of a benefited district to a major water
main facility without having made application therefor or without having
received approval thereof or without having paid the required connection fee
established by a connection fee ordinance, the City shall be entitled to
disconnect such private water connection until such time as the property owner
has made and received approval of his or her application, and/or has paid the
required connection fee.

wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s
are determined from periodic grab samples).

The City has and will incur certain capital expenses relating to the provision
of sanitary sewer services to the citizens of the City. A portion of these
expenses is being incurred for the purpose of accommodating future growth of
the City. The purpose of this chapter is to establish capital charges to be
paid by developers and builders representing a proportional equitable share of
the expenses incurred by the City for expanding its sewer services to
accommodate growth. These capital charges are not intended to recover the cost
for distribution system needs.
100.02 SEWER DISTRICT CREATED.
One sewer district is hereby created which includes all land within the
corporate limits of the City of Norwalk, Warren County, Iowa.
100.03 PAYMENT OF CAPITAL CHARGES.
Every developer, prior to final plat approval, shall be required to pay a
capital fee for the sanitary sewer utilities as described herein. This fee
shall be in addition to all other fees and/or charges arising out of connecting
to the City’s sewer utility except for any other such fees adopted pursuant to
Section 384.38(3) of the Code of Iowa. Additionally, every builder, upon
application for a building permit, shall be required to pay a capital fee as
described herein.
100.04 SEWER CAPITAL CHARGES.
The City’s sewer capital charges shall be as follows:
   1.   For a single family residential development in a newly platted area
where the final plat is filed after the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, the effective capital charge shall be based on a per
unit flat fee as shown in Section
100.05. Fifty percent (50%) of the fee shall be paid prior to the approval of
the final plat by the City, with the remainder due at the time an application
for building permit is made.
   2.   For a single family residential unit, where the final plat was approved
by the City prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, a fee as established in
Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances, shall be paid at the time an
application for building permit is made.
   3.   For a non-single family residential unit, a per unit fee, as reflected
in Section
100.05, shall be paid at the time an application for building permit is made.
   4.   For nonresidential development, a minimum charge, or alternatively, a
per-fixture unit charge, whichever is greater, as shown in Section
100.05, shall be paid at the time an application for building permit is made.
(See Fixture Units Table in the Appendix to this Code of Ordinances for
determining fixture units.)

101.01 DEFINITIONS.
The following words have the following definitions when used in this chapter,
and in any resolution and order adopted pursuant hereto, unless the context
requires otherwise or unless such word is expressly defined otherwise:
   1.   “Connection” means the physical act or process of directing or allowing
the flow of storm and surface waters to the storm sewer or drainage line, or
joining onto an existing side sewer, for the purpose of connecting private
impervious surface or other storm and surface water sources or systems to the
public storm and surface water system. It also includes creation or maintenance
of an impervious surface that causes or is likely to cause an increase in the
quantity or decrease in quality or both from the natural state of storm water
runoff, and which drains, directly or indirectly, to the storm and surface
water system.
   2.   “Date of imposition” or “imposition date” means July 1 of each fiscal
year or such other date designated by the Council at which time a charge is
imposed and becomes the legal obligation of the user. The obligation may
include the cost of services to be provided during the billing period or for
services previously provided to the same person under this chapter.
   3.   “Days” means calendar days unless otherwise specified.
   4.   “Equivalent Service Unit” or “ESU” means a measurement unit based on
the impervious surface area of an average improved single family dwelling lot
or parcel within the City (as determined by a statistical sampling performed by
the City). Except as provided in Section
101.04, one equivalent service unit shall be deemed to be 3,000 square feet of
impervious surface. See subsection 101.05(1), “Flat Rate Uses” for further
clarification.
   5.   “Impervious surface area” means all land area that has been altered
from its natural state such that it does not allow the infiltration and
retention of water equivalent to that of undisturbed soil. This includes, but
is not limited to: pavement, buildings, decks, parking areas, and compacted
gravel areas. Impervious surface does not include improved streets, roads and
sidewalks within the public right-of-way; bike paths; railroad beds; or quarry
excavation areas and temporary service roads in the excavation areas. Rather,
such facilities are deemed to be part of the public surface water drainage
conveyance system or to constitute non-impervious surfaces.
   6.   “Improved single dwelling parcel” means a lot or parcel on which a
single family dwelling or duplex exists at any time during the same years as
the imposition of the charge.
   7.   “Occupant” means the person residing or doing business on the property.
In a family or household situation, the occupants responsible for the
obligations herein imposed are the adult heads of the household, jointly and
severally. In a dwelling or office sharing situation, the adult occupant
legally responsible for the management or condition of the property is
responsible.
   8.   “Owner” means the legal owner of record as shown on the tax rolls of
Warren County, or where there is a recorded land sale contract, the purchaser
thereunder.
   9.   “Person” means any individual, public or private corporation, political
subdivision, governmental agency, municipality, partnership, association, firm,
trust, or any other legal entity whatsoever.
   10.   “Rule” means any written standard, directive, interpretation, policy,
regulation, procedure or other provision adopted by the Council as a resolution
and order to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
   11.   “Storm and Surface Water Drainage System” means any combination of
publicly owned storm and surface water quantity and quality facilities,
pumping, or lift facilities, storm and secondary drain pipes and culverts, open
channels, creeks and rivers, force mains, laterals, manholes, catch basins and
inlets, including the grates and covers thereof, detention and retention
facilities, laboratory facilities and equipment, and any other publicly owned
facilities for the collection, conveyance, treatment and disposal of storm and
surface water within the City, to which sanitary sewage flows are not
intentionally admitted.
   12.   “User” means any person who uses property which maintains connection
to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the City for surface
water management. The occupant of occupied property is deemed the user. If the
property is not occupied, the person who has the right to occupy it is deemed
the user.
101.02 STORM WATER UTILITY ESTABLISHED.
Pursuant to the authority of Section 384.84 of the Code of Iowa, the Council
hereby establishes a storm water utility in the City. The entire City, as
increased from time to time, shall constitute a single Storm and Surface Water
Drainage System District.
101.03 CHARGES AND FEES IN GENERAL.
The Council may adopt, by ordinance, charges, rates, and fees for the use of
the City’s Storm and Surface Water System, and for services provided by the
City relating to that system. Charges may include delinquency and interest
charges and penalties. Such charges and fees shall be just and equitable based
upon the actual costs of operation, maintenance, acquisition, extension and
replacement of the City’s system, the costs of bond repayment, regulation,
administration, and services of the City. Except as specifically provided by
ordinance, all charges and service fees shall be due and payable in advance of
provision of service. All billing and collection procedures shall be the same
as for water and sanitary sewer usage and may be billed on the same bill.
101.04 STORM WATER UTILITY USER CHARGE.
   1.   There hereby is established a Storm Water Utility System User Charge.
This charge is imposed on every user within the City of the Storm and Surface
Water Drainage System on the imposition date. The charge may be required to be
paid in advance of the provision of service for the billing period. The charge
due for the billing period shall be the obligation of the user of the public
storm system on the imposition date, notwithstanding whether the user is the
addressee of the bill.
   2.   The charge shall be the personal obligation of the user on the
imposition date, regardless of whether that person has any ownership interest
in the property. This charge shall constitute a debt due the City as of the
date of imposition.
   3.   Any person who has paid the full amount due in advance of receiving
service shall be entitled to a refund if the person ceases to be the user. The
refund shall be effective on the date the property is vacated or sold and based
on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The refund is waived
unless a written request for refund is filed within thirty (30) days of
vacating or selling the property. The request shall include documentation
reasonably deemed adequate by the City. Notwithstanding any other provision,
the new user shall be responsible for the remaining balance of the service
charge, which may be billed immediately or added to the bill for the next
period.
   4.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the real
property, as shown in the records of the County Assessor, is the occupant.
   5.   The Storm Water Utility User Charge shall be imposed upon any person
who uses or discharges to the public storm and surface water drainage system
by:
      A.   Maintaining impervious surface connected to (directly or indirectly)
and capable of discharge to the public surface water management systems; or
      B.   Actually discharging storm or surface water into the system; or
      C.   For which a specific request for storm and surface water management
service has been made.
Said charge shall be charged for all users of properties within the boundaries
of the City. A property, whether unimproved or containing impervious surface,
is presumed to discharge storm water to the Storm and Surface Water Drainage
System, and to generate a demand for storm and surface water drainage services,
unless that property has an on-site disposal system which meets the standard of
Section
101.09 and any rules adopted thereunder.
101.05 CALCULATION OF EQUIVALENT SERVICE UNITS AND AMOUNT OF CHARGE.
This section shall be used to determine the number of Equivalent Service Units
(ESUs) for a property for purposes of determining the amount of Storm Water
Utility (SWU) service charges and the water quantity component of the SWU.
There are two types of uses: flat rate uses and measured uses. These are
defined as follows:
   1.   Flat Rate Uses. Improved properties that qualify under this section as
flat rate uses shall be charged at the rate of one (1) ESU per dwelling unit.
The following uses shall be defined as “flat rate” uses:
      A.   A “Flat Rate Use Residence” is a residential structure not attached
to another residential structure on one or more parcels of land, providing
there are not more than two residential structures on one parcel. Flat Rate Use
Residences shall have impervious surfaces totaling no more than 6,000 square
feet in area. This definition also includes trailers, mobile homes, and
manufactured homes, if on separate parcels. Two separate dwelling units on a
single parcel shall be charged one (1) ESU per dwelling unit. Three or more
residential dwelling units on one parcel, whether attached or unattached, shall
be considered a multiple family residential use, and shall be a measured use,
as defined below.
      B.   A “Duplex” is two dwelling units joined to each other with a common
wall, or one above the other, on one or two parcels. The units may be under one
ownership, or owned separately. Each dwelling unit of the duplex shall be
charged one (1) ESU.
      C.   “Trailer Parks and Mobile Home Parks” includes trailers and mobile
homes on a single tax lot (even if there are more than two per tax lot) under
one ownership, where spaces are leased or rented for a mobile home or trailer
to be placed. Each space in a trailer park or mobile home park shall be charged
one (1) ESU whether or not there is a trailer or mobile home on the space.
Other impervious areas contained within the boundaries of the trailer park or
mobile home park shall not be measured. The owner of a taxed lot shall be
deemed the user.
      D.   An “Unimproved Parcel” is defined as parcel of land less than 7.5
acres with no impervious surfaces or a parcel of land larger than 7.5 acres
with less than 10 percent of impervious surface. Unimproved parcels shall be
charged 0.137 ESUs per acre.
   2.   Measured Uses. Properties that are not Flat Rate Uses are Measured
Uses. For such uses, the impervious surfaces of the property, as defined by
rule, shall be estimated by the City. The area shall be estimated using one or
more of the following: aerial photographs, assessment records, building
permits, construction plans, site visits, ad valorem property tax records,
storm and surface water system connection permits, field surveys or other
sources deemed reliable by the City. This area shall then be divided by 3,000
square feet, the area on one (1) Equivalent Service Unit within the City, and
then rounded to the nearest whole number. The minimum value shall be ESU.
The ESUs for all of the uses in this subsection shall be determined by
measuring the impervious area. All estimates made by the City are subject to
appeal pursuant to Section
101.11. If an appeal is not properly made, then the estimation of the City
shall be deemed correct.
      A.   The total charge for a “Multi-Family Residential Use” is calculated
for the entire complex by estimation of the total impervious surface area,
including the garages and common areas. The total ESUs shall be divided equally
among all units if the units have separate water billings. If the complex is
billed under one water billing, the recipient of that bill shall be deemed the
user and receive the total ESU charge for the complex.
      B.   “Commercial, Industrial, Institutional” categories include the
entire range of office, manufacturing service, sales restaurant, day care,
nursery, warehouse, churches, schools, utilities, public service buildings,
parks, hospital, nursing home, rest home, retirement home and other similar
uses.
      C.   A “Measured Use Residence” is a residential property with impervious
surfaces totaling more than 6,000 square feet.
   3.   General Policies.
      A.   Condominiums. The total charge for a condominium shall be calculated
for the entire complex by measurement of the total impervious surface area,
including the garages and common areas. The total ESUs shall be divided equally
among all units. “Units” are living units and do not include supporting uses,
such as garages, even though they may be on separate parcels.
      B.   No Limit on Charge for a Measured Use. Flat Rate Use residences and
duplexes are not individually estimated. All other uses are individually
estimated. If a use is an estimated use, its charge shall not be limited to one
ESU, even if it is residential.
      C.   Community Facilities. The flat rate category includes typical
residential uses within a parcel or single ownership, as defined above. If a
community or neighborhood recreation center or similar facility exists within a
subdivision, even if associated with the single family or duplex properties,
that property shall be measured and charged separately.
      D.   Seasonal Impervious Area. Properties which have areas that are
impervious for only a portion of the year shall constitute seasonal impervious
area. For example, a greenhouse that is covered six months and open with a
pervious floor for six months. If an impervious area is in place for more that
one month per year, it shall be included in the impervious area measurement,
unless exempted under the policy for “Spreading of Runoff to Pervious Surfaces”
(paragraph 4(D) of this section).
      E.   Miscellaneous.
         (1)   No credits, exemptions, or reductions shall be given for
impervious surfaces that are submerged for a portion of the year.
         (2)   A Flat Rate Use residence (or duplex unit) and garage, under one
ownership, shall be charged one ESU even if on two adjacent parcels.
         (3)   Swimming pools (not including the impervious deck around the
swimming pool) are exempted from SWU fees providing the filter drains are
connected to the sanitary sewer system.
         (4)   No waiver shall be given for small impervious areas on a large
pervious property.
   4.   Exclusion From Impervious Surface Measurement
      A.   Roads. Public roads shall not be included in the measurement of
impervious surface areas. All private roads are to be included in the
measurement of impervious surface areas, except private roads that serve flat
rate uses (single family, duplex and trailer park properties). “Private roads”
are defined as all roads and driveways which have not been dedicated to the
public and accepted for public use, and which are defined as an impervious
surface under other City rules.
      B.   Determination of Impervious Surfaces – Roadways. All roadways,
whether dirt, gravel, or paved, are considered impervious, and unless a part of
an exempted category of road, or a part of a flat rate use, shall be included
in the impervious area measurement. A “roadway” is defined as an area intended
for the purpose of providing access for motor vehicles. Motor vehicles include
automobiles. Roadways include such things as roads, streets and driveways.
      C.   Determination of Impervious Surfaces - Parking and Storage Areas.
         (1)   All parking and storage areas, whether dirt, gravel or paved,
are deemed impervious. A “parking area” is defined as an area where motor
vehicles are parked temporarily. This includes such areas as public and private
parking lots (regardless of frequency of use) and storage areas.
         (2)   A dirt or gravel area that is not accessed by motor vehicles, or
is not otherwise highly compacted, is considered pervious. This includes such
uses as landscaping, and gravel or dirt areas accessed only by foot traffic, or
small vehicles, as defined above.
         (3)   A user may submit information for City review showing that the
conditions of paragraph (2) above are valid. The City shall review such
information and may perform a site inspection. If, based upon objective,
verifiable information presented, or upon the site inspection performed, the
City may modify the ESUs for the property to conform to the actual impervious
surface. Failure to permit the City to perform a site inspection of the
property shall be grounds to deny an application for review under this
subsection.
      D.   Spreading of Runoff to Pervious Surfaces. Impervious areas shall be
excluded from measurement and charge if the runoff is spread to a pervious area
that does not otherwise receive rainfall. For properties which meet the
criteria of this paragraph, all or part of the impervious area may be excluded
from measurement and charge, as appropriate. For such property, the following
criteria shall apply:
         (1)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide
documentation as required by the City to demonstrate that the criteria are met.
         (2)   The area of impervious area that can be exempted is limited to
the area of the pervious area where the runoff is effectively spread.
         (3)   To qualify, the runoff from an impervious area must not be
concentrated but must remain as “sheet flow,” or be spread so it is in sheet
flow; the runoff must pass through the pervious area before it is collected in
a drain or channel system and carried away; and there cannot be any barriers
such as a concrete foundation preventing the sheet flow runoff from passing
through the impervious area.
   5.   Exemption From SWU Service Charges.
      A.   Users of properties for which all storm water is disposed of on-
site, as defined by City standards, may request an exemption from SWU service
charges. No partial exemptions for disposal of only a portion of the storm and
surface waters on-site, shall be allowed. In order to qualify for service
charge exemption, the user must design, construct and maintain an on-site
facility that keeps all storm and surface water for the full range of storms
during the year. This applicant for exemption must pay an initial inspection/
review fee. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “property” means a
parcel of land, or a group of adjacent parcels working in cooperation. The term
“on-site disposal” means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near
vicinity of the parcel requesting the exemption.
      B.   In order to qualify for the exemption, the on-site system must
encompass the entire property (except for incidental impervious areas as
defined below), must be completely separated from the public system, and must
provide adequate on-site disposal. Incidental area such as sidewalks, decks,
and driveway aprons, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total impervious
area. On-site disposal facilities that may qualify are dry wells, injection
wells, retention basins with percolation/evaporation capacity, and retention
basins with capacity large enough to accommodate the total of all storms
through the year. Many of these may have a possible adverse effect on
groundwater, and some techniques may require approval of State, Federal and
local agencies.
      C.   To qualify, an applicant must submit a request to the City for a
waiver of monthly service charges relating to the property. This request shall
include a certification from an engineer, or other evidence acceptable to the
City, that shows the system is separate and will dispose of the full range and
volume of storm water through the year on-site. The applicant shall also submit
a maintenance plan for assuring the system will function as designed. The
application must be signed by the property owner. An inspection/review fee
shall be paid at the time of application. If the application is denied, the
inspection/review fee will be credited to the service charges due. If the
request for the waiver is made as part of the construction plans, this fee
shall be waived. A decision denying an exemption may be appealed following the
procedures in Section
101.11. If approved, the waiver will be effective for the next billing cycle.
      D.   The City retains the right to inspect the on-site measures to assure
they are functioning as designed. If at any time the measures are found to not
be effective, the exemption shall cease.
   6.   Credits For Water Quantity Portion of the SWU.
New developments that provide on-site retention, disposal, or detention, or
provide off-site conveyance system enlargements are entitled to a credit in SWU
fees. To be eligible, new development, or portions of new development, must
include design and construction of a facility that meets one of the following
standards:
      A.   Retention facility sized to accommodate the full volume of storm
water through the year with no overflow or release into the SWU system.
Eligible facilities shall be exempt from SWU fees.
      B.   A disposal facility which keeps all storm and surface water
separated from the public system, and disposes of it on-site for the full range
of storms during the year, including the winter, through on-site disposal (dry
wells, injection wells, percolation/evaporation basins). Eligible facilities
shall be exempt from SWU fees
      C.   A detention facility which meets or exceeds the standards defined in
City rules for on-site storm water detention facilities. Eligible facilities
shall be entitled to a reduction of one-half of the actual number of ESUs
calculated.
      D.   Upsizing of the downstream conveyance system. Credit shall be
determined by the City on case by case basis.
The term “on-site” means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near
vicinity of that for which the credit or reduction is requested. To be eligible
for a credit (reduction) of SWU fees, the request must be submitted prior to,
or a part of, the development process, but in all cases the request must be
made prior to the payment of the SWU fees. To be eligible for a credit, the
request can be made at any time in writing to the City. The request shall
demonstrate the property meets one of the above conditions. For on-site
facilities, the City reserves the right to inspect the facilities installed at
any time. If it is found that the system no longer functions, then the SWU fees
that were waived will become due and payable.
101.06 RATES.
The monthly rates for the service charge per ESU shall be established pursuant
to ordinance and shall be based upon those factors outlined in Section
101.04. The storm water service charge is as established in
Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances. All ESU records for all properties
within the City shall be kept on file in the City Clerk’s office and shall be
available during normal office hours for examination.
101.07 BILLING.
   1.   The City shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to every
user in the City. Mailing to the owner of record as shown in the assessor
records shall satisfy this requirement. The billing period shall be the same as
for water usage.
   2.   The recipient has twenty (20) days from the billing date to file a
notice of non-occupancy. The notice shall indicate the relationship of the
recipient to the property (e.g., owner, lessor, mortgagee), whether on the
imposition date the property was occupied, and if so, by whom.
   3.   Upon receipt of the notice, the City shall determine who is obligated
for payment. Based on this determination, the City shall:
      A.   Issue a new bill to the occupant if the property was occupied by
someone other than the original recipient;
      B.   Reissue the bill to the recipient if it is found that the person was
the occupant;
      C.   Issue a bill to the owner as the user, if the property was not
occupied.
The City may take into account any reasonably reliable information available to
it, including utility or water district records.
   4.   Failure to file the notice so that it is actually received by the City
within the 20 days of the mailing date of the bill shall conclusively establish
that the original addressee was the use on the imposition date.
   5.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person may
agree in writing to be responsible for payment of the charge. Upon filing of
such a writing with the City, subsequent bills shall be sent to that person,
and that person shall be deemed to be the user.
   6.   It is a violation of this chapter to knowingly provide false
information to the City regarding any fact related to billing of a storm water
utility service charge or other charge of the City.
101.08 DELINQUENCY, COLLECTION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   1.   Charges imposed under this chapter are deemed delinquent when not paid
in full by the due date provided in a billing for the charge.
   2.   It is unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to
discharge wastewater into the City’s Storm Water Utility System. It is also
unlawful and a violation of this chapter to maintain a connection to or use the
City’s Storm Water Utility System without paying the appropriate charges and
fees established in this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant hereto. Even if
no billing is received, such charges shall be due and owing and the user is
obligated to pay any charges in a timely fashion.
   3.   Delinquent charges may be collected pursuant to the same procedure as
with delinquent water bills by the City without further action or authorization
by the Council.
   4.   In addition to remedies provided for collection of a debt, the City may
seek a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting continued occupancy of
premises, requiring disconnection of the premises from the public storm water
utility system, and termination of water and sewer service to the user’s
premises.
   5.   In a collection action under this chapter, the City shall be entitled
to its costs and reasonable attorney fees, including at trial and on appeal, if
it is the prevailing party.
   6.   In addition to the right of the City to bring a civil action to collect
any delinquent charges or enforce any provision of this chapter, the City may
take any of the following actions to secure payment:
      A.   The City may refuse to issue any permit to any person who is
delinquent in any payment due under this chapter.
      B.   The City may terminate sanitary sewer service to premises used by
the user.
      C.   The City may terminate water service to the premises used by the
user.
If the City terminates service as provided in this section, the cost of such
disconnection shall be added to the amount of any other delinquent charges and
shall be recoverable in the same manner as are such charges.
   7.   Where a lien against the property can be imposed when the owner is
liable, it shall exist from the date the bill was last brought current in the
same manner as with a lien for water service.
101.09 REQUEST FOR USE RECLASSIFICATION.
   1.   Any user of the public storm water utility system may disconnect
property served by the system from service and terminate further user charges
by utilizing the procedure in this section.
   2.   Any user of the public storm water utility may remove all or part of
the impervious surface on the property served by the system and apply for use
reclassification by utilizing the procedure in this section.
   3.   A person desiring to disconnect property from the system shall make
application on a form provided by the City and pay the fee, is any, established
therefor. The application shall be signed by the owner of the property, shall
provide evidence of demolition or removal of any impervious surface on the
property, or of installation of an approved on-site storm and surface water
retention or infiltration system serving the property. Such on-site system
shall be designed and operated to retain or dispose of on-site all storm and
surface waters generated by the property, through the full range of storm
events prescribed by City rule. The Council may adopt additional criteria and
administrative procedures to provide for disconnection from storm water utility
service, and suspension or termination of user charges.
   4.   Upon receipt of a complete application for disconnection or
reclassification, and verification of information thereon, and installation of
the on-site system or demolition of impervious area as provided in this
section, the City shall issue a permit for disconnection or reclassification.
Whether performed by the City or other person, the City shall inspect the
disconnection.
   5.   The City may inspect the on-site system at any time. If at any time the
system fails to perform to the standard specified above, the City shall notify
the owner to correct the system. If the system is not corrected to meet on-site
retention or infiltration standards within thirty (30) days of such notice, the
City may treat such deficiency as a reconnection to the storm water utility
system and as a specific request for storm water utility service. Service fees
shall then relate back to the earliest date on which the system failed to meet
applicable performance standards for on-site retention or disposal.
   6.   If at any time after reclassification an impervious surface is added to
the property, the City shall consider such an addition as a reconnection to the
storm water utility and as a specific request for storm water utility service.
101.10 ADOPTION OF RULES.

the responsible party.
      E.   An unreasonable delay in allowing the Inspector access to a property
is a violation of this chapter.
      F.   If the Inspector has been refused access to any part of the property
from which an illegal connection and/or illicit discharge is occurring,
suspected or imminent, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter, or to protect the overall

103.03 GENERAL ADOPTION.
The provisions of this chapter are enacted to aid in the enforcement of the
pretreatment regulations set forth in this chapter and may be placed in a
separate portion of the municipal or county code of any WRA participating
community which adopts these provisions. Each WRA participating community by
enacting this chapter designates the WRA and its operating contractor as the
enforcement agency under this chapter. Employees, agents and officers of the
WRA and of its operating contractor, while acting to enforce this chapter for
the WRA, are empowered to make such inspections, issue such orders or permits
and take such actions within the corporate boundaries of the city as are
authorized by this chapter. The WRA or its operating contractor is also
authorized to impose and collect all fees or penalties authorized by this
chapter, and are authorized to directly bill and collect from contributors
penalties, fees charges and surcharges from all users within the city. A user's
failure to pay any fee, charge, penalty or surcharge is a municipal infraction
and shall also be grounds to discontinue sewer service to the user, all as
hereafter more particularly provided. The enforcement of this chapter in the
city is not dependent upon passage of this chapter or a similar ordinance by
other WRA participating communities.
103.04 INTENT AND CONSTRUCTION.
This chapter seeks to implement provisions of the Act, the general pretreatment
regulations found at 40 CFR, Part 403, and the Iowa Administrative Code,
chapter 567, sections 62.4 and 62.8. This chapter is to be construed and
applied in accordance with the Clean Water Act amendments, the general
pretreatment regulations, the Iowa Administrative Code and the purpose and
policy provision set forth in section
103.05 of this division.
103.05 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   1.   This chapter regulates the use of sanitary sewers; private wastewater
disposal; the installation and connection of building sewers; and the discharge
of wastewater or waste into the POTW. This chapter sets forth uniform
requirements for discharges into the POTW, and the deposit of wastewater and
waste hauled to the WRF or to other locations approved by the WRA director for
disposal and treatment.
   2.   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      A.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may
interfere with the operation of the system or interfere with sludge management
and disposal.
      B.   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may pass
through the system inadequately treated and ultimately into receiving water,
the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system.
      C.   Protect workers' safety and health and protect against damage to the
POTW.
      D.   Provide for equitable distribution of treatment and industrial
pretreatment costs resulting from pollutants introduced into the POTW.
103.06 JURISDICTION.
The sections of this chapter are applicable in their entirety to all users who
contribute wastewater, directly or indirectly, into the POTW without regard to
whether the physical facilities of such users are situated within or outside
the corporate limits of the city.
103.07 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any particular
person or particular circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not
affect other provisions or application of this chapter which can be given
effect without the invalid provision or application. To this end the provisions
of this chapter are severable.
103.08 INTERPRETATION.
This chapter shall be construed and interpreted to conform with 40 CFR I, and
it is the intent of this chapter that it comply with the federal regulations.
103.09 - 103.17 RESERVED
DIVISION 2: WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND PRETREATMENT
103.18 USER REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   The following requirements shall apply to all users of the POTW:
      A.   All users shall promptly notify the WRA director in advance of any
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge.
      B.   New or increased contributions of pollutants or changes in the
nature of pollutant discharged to the POTW shall require prior approval by the
WRA director.
      C.   Industrial users shall notify the WRA director, the Environmental
Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR 261. The notification shall comply with the requirements set forth in 40
CFR 403.12(p).
      D.   Discharge of any pollutants without the notice and approval required
by this section is prohibited. Upon the receipt of notice required by this
section, the WRA director shall within 180 days or less approve the discharge
if he or she finds the proposed discharge meets applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements and would not cause the WRA to violate its National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. The WRA director shall deny
permission for the discharge if he or she finds applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements are not met or the discharge would cause a violation
of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the WRF. In
lieu of denial of permission for discharge, the WRA director may allow such
discharge or contribution upon conditions which would not violate applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements and would not cause a violation of the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the WRF.
      E.   Food Service Establishments shall be regulated first under Division
5 of this ordinance but may be required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit
and be subject to the requirements of Divisions 1-4 if the WRA Director
determines that additional pretreatment is required in order to comply with
Fat, Oil, & Grease discharge limits.
   2.   Any part of this section notwithstanding, upon receipt of the notice
required by this section, the WRA director may require, in addition to the
requirements of this section, that an industrial user obtain a permit under
this chapter.
   3.   Users who are determined to be industrial users as herein defined and
who refuse to apply for or obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall be
subject to termination of sewer services as provided in section
103.71 hereof.
103.19 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.

contained in 40 CFR I, subchapter N, part 405-471 shall comply with the
standards and applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. New
sources of categorical discharge shall meet National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards in the shortest feasible time, but in no case longer than 90 days
from the commencement of discharge. Failure to comply shall be a violation of
this chapter and subject the user to enforcement action. The WRA is required to
notify all known affected categorical users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. Failure of the WRA to notify a user shall not
relieve the user of the duty, if any, to comply with National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards.
103.22 STATE REQUIREMENTS.
State of Iowa requirements and limitations on discharges pursuant to this
chapter shall apply when they are more stringent than U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency or WRA requirements and limitations unless allowed by the
Iowa department of natural resources.
103.23 CITY’S RIGHT TO REVISION.
The city, acting at the direction of the WRA, reserves the right to establish
more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW than those
contained in this chapter if deemed necessary to comply with the purpose and
policy objectives presented in section
103.05 of this chapter.
103.24 PRETREATMENT.
   1.   A user discharging or with potential to discharge any waste into the
POTW as set forth in section
103.19,
103.20 or
103.21 of this division shall be required by the WRA director to construct,
install and operate, at the user's sole expense, such pretreatment facilities
as may be required in order to:
      A.   Reduce the objectionable characteristics or constituents of
wastewater to within the maximum limits provided for in sections
103.19,
103.20,
103.21 and
103.22 of this chapter.
      B.   Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such wastewater.
      C.   Reduce the pollutants to such concentration and flows as may be
contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit.
      D.   Prevent the discharge of liquid waste containing FOG, sand in
excessive amounts, any flammable waste, or other harmful pollutants. All traps
or similar devices shall be of a type and capacity needed to perform
effectively and shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. All traps or devices shall be provided and maintained in efficient
operating condition at all times. Materials removed from traps shall be
considered unacceptable for disposal at the WRF unless specifically approved by
the WRA director.
   2.   All plans, specifications, technical operating data and other
information pertinent to the proposed operation and maintenance of pretreatment
facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the WRA director prior to
construction. Design and installation of such facilities shall be subject to
the requirements of all applicable codes, chapters and laws, including local
zoning regulations. The review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall, in no way, relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
WRA director under this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operations shall be reported to and be acceptable to
the WRA director prior to the user's initiations of the changes.
   3.   Users shall continuously maintain all pretreatment facilities required
by this chapter in satisfactory and effective operating condition at the sole
expense of such user.
   4.   No section contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or
prohibit a separate or special agreement between the WRA and any user whereby
wastewater containing waste of unusual strength, character or composition may
be accepted for treatment, subject to additional payment by such user;
provided, however, that such agreement shall have the prior approval of the WRA
Board, shall not conflict with the Iowa department of natural resources and
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements, and shall be consistent with
subsection 2 of
103.20 and sections
103.21 and
103.22 of this chapter, and subsection 6 of this section.
   5.   The WRA director may reject any waste which, in the opinion of the
director, may cause interference or pass through.
6.   Users shall obtain the specific approval of the WRA director prior to
discharging any waste resulting from a pretreatment facility to the POTW. The
WRA director may develop a documentation system to track the transportation and
final disposition of any pretreatment waste. Pretreatment waste regulated by
this subsection shall include waste generated as a result of pretreatment
processes used to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permits, air pollution permits, wastewater discharge permits, soil/groundwater
reclamation processes, and pollutants resulting from a spill of any liquid or
solid material or the cleanup of any such spill. Pretreatment waste is
prohibited from disposal to the water of the state except as specifically
permitted by the Iowa department of natural resources.
103.25 DILUTION PROHIBITED.
Users shall not increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or with any other pollutant-
specific limitation developed by the WRA or its Operating Contractor.
103.26 SPILL CONTAINMENT.
   1.   Users having the ability to cause interference or pass through or to
discharge a slug shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW
of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
constructed, installed, operated and maintained at the user's sole cost and
expense.
   2.   Users meeting the criteria in subsection 1 of this section shall
develop a spill containment plan. The plan shall require the approval of the
WRA director and shall contain the following:
      A.   A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
      B.   A description of stored chemicals.
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the WRA of slug discharges,
including any that would violate the discharge prohibitions in section
103.19 of this division. Notification procedures shall comply with subsections
3 and 4 of this section.
      D.   A description of procedures and structures necessary to prevent
adverse impacts upon the POTW from accidental spills including inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      E.   A schedule for the completion or implementation of necessary
procedures and structures. Complete implementation and installation of any
procedures or structures shall be according to the shortest possible schedule,
but in no case longer than one year. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to
modify and operate its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
   3.   Users shall immediately telephone and notify the WRA of any accidental
or deliberate discharge of pollutants which violates section
103.19 of this division or which is a slug load. Any discharge into the POTW of
a substance which is a listed or characteristic waste under section 3001 of
RCRA must be immediately reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Regional Director, the Iowa department of natural resources, and the WRA.
Notifications required in this subsection shall include the name of caller,
location and time of discharge, pollutant concentration, volume and the
corrective actions taken.
   4.   Users shall submit a written report to the WRA director within five
days following such an accidental or deliberate discharge describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Users shall submit follow-up reports as may be required by
the WRA director. Such report shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such
report relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which
may be imposed by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or
deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the
city, result in the revocation of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit.
   5.   Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of pretreatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
to the user's pretreatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   6.   Users required to have a spill containment plan must permanently post a
notice in English and the language of common use on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if a prohibited
discharge occurs. Users shall ensure that all employees who are in a position
to cause, discover, or observe such an accidental discharge are advised of the
emergency notification procedures.
103.27 TREATMENT UPSETS.
Users shall inform the WRA director within one hour of becoming aware of an
upset in operations that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance with
the pollutant limits in this chapter. Users shall provide a follow-up written
report to the WRA director within five days. The report must demonstrate that
the pretreatment facility was being operated in a prudent and appropriate
manner and shall contain:
   1.   A description of the upset, its cause, and impact on the user's
compliance status.
   2.   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored.
   3.   All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence
of such an upset.
103.28 TREATMENT BYPASS.
   1.   Under this chapter, bypass is prohibited unless it is unavoidable to
prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage or no feasible
alternatives exist such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention
of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
   2.   The user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause a violation
of pretreatment standards, but only if it is for essential maintenance to
ensure efficient operation.
   3.   Notification of bypass shall be submitted in accordance with the
following:
      A.   Anticipated bypass. If the user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior written notice, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, to the WRA director.
      B.   Unanticipated bypass. The user shall immediately notify the WRA
director and submit a written report to the WRA within five days. This report
shall specify the following:
         (1)   A description of the bypass, its cause, and the duration.
         (2)   Whether the bypass has been corrected.
         (3)   The steps being taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and
prevent a reoccurrence of the bypass.
   4.   Proper notification shall not relieve the user of liability for
treatment costs and fees or other remedies as provided for in section
103.24 of this division.
103.29 FEES.
To provide for the recovery of costs from users of the POTW and for the
implementation of the pretreatment program established by this article, the

DIVISION 3: INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
103.39 CLASSES OF PERMIT.
Discharge permit classifications shall be as follows:
   1.   Class A permit issued to a user discharging 25,000 gallons per day or
more of process wastewater (excludes sanitary, non-contact cooling, and boiler
blowdown).
   2.   Class B permit issued to a user discharging less than 25,000 gallons
per day of process wastewater.
103.40 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   All new industrial users shall notify the WRA director of the nature
and characteristics of their proposed discharge 180 days prior to commencing
discharge. A notification form prescribed by the WRA shall be used for this
purpose
   2.   Significant users shall discharge wastewater, either directly or
indirectly, into the POTW only after obtaining a wastewater discharge permit
from the WRA director. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve
a user of the obligation to obtain other permits required by federal, state, or
local law.
   3.   Other users, including waste haulers, shall obtain permits as required
by the WRA director.
103.41 PERMIT APPLICATIONS; BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS; COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.
Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit or categorical users
submitting a baseline monitoring report shall submit the following information
as required by 40 CFR 403.12 or by the WRA director:
   1.   Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit must submit an
application form prescribed by the WRA and accompanied by the application fee.
All new significant users must submit such application 180 days prior to the
date of any wastewater discharge.
   2.   Existing users subject to new National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards must, within 180 days after the effective date of the standard,
submit a baseline monitoring report prescribed by the WRA. New users subject to
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards must submit a baseline monitoring
report prescribed by the WRA at least 90 days prior to commencement of
discharge to the POTW. A baseline monitoring report shall include:
      A.   Name, address, and location of the facility, if different from the
mailing address.
      B.   Name of the operator and owners of the facility.
      C.   A list of all environmental control permits held by or for the
facility.
      D.   A description of the operations including the average rate of
production, applicable Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes,
schematic process diagrams, and points of discharge to the POTW from regulated
processes.
      E.   Daily average and daily maximum flow measurements for regulated
process waste streams and non-regulated waste streams where necessary.
      F.   The categorical user shall identify the pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process and shall submit the results of sampling
and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required)
of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards from each regulated process.
      G.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample
immediately downstream of any pretreatment facility or immediately downstream
of each regulated process if no pretreatment exists and prior to mixing with
other waste to compile that data necessary to comply with this requirement. If
non-regulated wastewater is mixed with regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment, the user must measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to
evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6
(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the
WRA director. Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with 40
CFR 136 or other verified method approved by the WRA director.
      H.   The time, date, and place of sampling, methods of analysis, and
certification that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work
cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
      I.   Historical data may be allowed by the WRA director so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
      J.   Certification by an authorized representative of the user as
referenced in section
103.51 and certified to by a qualified professional indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance or additional pretreatment is required for
the user to meet pretreatment standards and requirements.
      K.   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet
pretreatment standards, requirements, discharge limits as set forth in section
103.19,
103.20,
103.21 of this chapter, or any other limit set by the WRA director, the user
shall supply a compliance schedule indicating the shortest time schedule
necessary to accomplish installation or adoption of such additional
pretreatment or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later
than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
The following conditions apply to this schedule:
         (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards. Such schedule shall include, where
applicable, but shall not be limited to dates for the hiring of an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing construction, beginning operation, and conducting routine
operations.
         (2)   No increment referred to in subsection (2)k.i of this section
shall exceed nine months, nor shall the total compliance period exceed 18
months.
         (3)   No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
WRA director, including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the

the user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than
nine months elapse between such progress reports to the WRA director.
      L.   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants required, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The WRA director may
waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user who demonstrates that
flow-proportional sampling is not feasible. In such cases, samples may be
obtained through time-proportional techniques or through a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that such sampling will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
   3.   New significant users not subject to categorical standards shall submit
analysis of wastewater representative of the effluent discharged to the POTW as
required in subsections (2)g-i of this section for all parameters deemed
necessary by the WRA director.

The WRA director may deny a wastewater discharge permit to any user whose
discharge of material to the POTW, whether shown upon application, including
test results submitted by the applicant, or determined after inspection or
testing conducted by the WRA or its operating contractor, is not in conformity
with this chapter or whose application is incomplete or does not comply with
the requirements of section
103.41 of this division.
103.49 PERMIT VIOLATIONS.
Any violation of the terms, conditions, or limits of a user's wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall subject
the user to all enforcement procedures outlined in this chapter.
103.50 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
Under this division, periodic compliance reports are required as follows:
   1.   Significant users shall submit to the WRA director, during the months
of January and July, a report indicating the nature, concentration, and flow of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by permit or pretreatment
standards for the preceding six-month period. This report shall include a
record of the monthly average flows and the daily flow for each analysis date
during the reporting period. At the discretion of the WRA director and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, etc., the WRA director may agree to alter the months during which the
reports are to be submitted. More frequent reports may be required by the WRA
director.
   2.   The WRA director may impose mass limitations on users. In such cases,
the report required by subsection 1 of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. All
analyses shall be performed using Environmental Protection Agency approved
methods using sampling techniques approved by the Iowa department of natural
resources.
   3.   Users shall meet the certification and signatory requirements in
section
103.51 of this division for each report submitted under this section. Where the
WRA itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow
data, the industrial user will not be required to submit a periodic compliance
report.
   4.   A user must notify the WRA director of all violations identified as a
result of self-monitoring to the POTW by telephone, during normal business
hours, within 24 hours of the time the user becomes aware of such violation.
The user must also submit the results of repeat analyses to the WRA within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation, together with a complete report on
all steps taken to resolve the violation. The user need not repeat the analyses
if:
      A.   The WRA performs sampling of the industrial user at a frequency of
at least once per month; or
   B.   The WRA performs sampling of the user between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results
of this sampling.
   5.   A user who monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
WRA or who self-monitors in addition to WRA monitoring, using Environmental
Protection Agency methods or standard methods, shall report the monitoring
results to the WRA director in accordance with subsections 1, 3, and 4 of this
section.
103.51 CERTIFICATIONS AND SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   All applications or reports submitted by a user pursuant to this
division shall contain the following certification statement:
      “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
   2.   All applications and reports shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the user as defined in section
103.01 of this chapter. A user shall maintain a current and accurate
authorization on file with the WRA director.
103.52 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   1.   When required by the WRA director pursuant to this division, each
permitted user shall at its expense provide and operate monitoring facilities
to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer or
internal drainage systems. The WRA director may require the placement of such
monitoring facilities at the end of each process where pollutants are used,
produced, or treated. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on
the user's premises and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
   2.   When required by the wastewater discharge permit and within 90 days of
written notification, a user shall install a sampling chamber for each separate
discharge of the building sewer in accordance with plans and specification
approved by the WRA director. A user shall provide ample room in or near such
sampling chamber to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. Each user shall at its expense maintain all sampling and measuring
equipment in a safe and proper operating condition at all times, which
equipment shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to authorized
representatives of the WRA. Users shall certify all flow measuring devices to
be in proper working condition at a frequency specified in the permit or in
writing by the WRA director, using a qualified technician acceptable to the WRA
director. Sampling shall be in accordance with the following:
      A.   Each sampling chamber shall contain a flume unless another device is
approved by the WRA director, with a recording and totalizing device for
measurement of the liquid quantity.
      B.   At the discretion of the WRA director, metered water supply to a
user may be used as the volume quantity where it is substantiated that the
metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where
a measurable adjustment agreed to by the director is made in the metered water
supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. Separate meters may be used to
subtract water which is not discharged to the POTW or is discharged to a sewer
other than the sampled location.
      C.   Samples shall be taken at a frequency and volume determined by the
WRA director and shall be properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance
with Environmental Protection Agency approved methods. The sample shall be
composited in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. A
time proportioned 24-hour sample may be used if flow proportioned sampling is
determined by the WRA director to be impractical. Grab samples shall be used
where appropriate.
   3.   A user must inform the WRA director prior to breaking a sampler seal,
used by the WRA to detect sample tampering, unless necessary to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage. A user shall not place
additional seals or locks upon a sampler which may be used by the WRA without
first obtaining approval from the WRA director.
103.53 INSPECTION, SAMPLING, AND RECORD KEEPING AUTHORITY.
Under this division, users shall be deemed to have given the following
authorities to the WRA and its operating contractor:
   1.   Users shall permit authorized representatives or agents of the WRA to
enter upon all properties and all parts of the premises, or upon properties of
users with wastewater discharge permits, for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination, records copying, or the performance of any of
their duties. This shall include the right to set up, on the user's property,
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance
monitoring, or metering operations as may be required in pursuance of the
implementation and enforcement of this chapter.
   2.   Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements in the security measures so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, WRA or operating contractor personnel will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   3.   All users subject to any of the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall maintain copies of reports and records of all information as required in
40 CFR 403.12(o) resulting from any monitoring activities required by this
chapter for a minimum of three years and shall make such records available for
inspection and copying by the WRA and its operating contractor. This period of
retention shall be extended until the completion of any unresolved negotiation,
hearing, or litigation involving a purported violation.
103.54 CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS, DATA AND INFORMATION.
   1.   Except as provided in this section, documents, data and information
obtained from user reports, questionnaires, permit applications and inspections
pursuant to this division shall be made available to the public or other
governmental agencies without restriction. If the user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate that the release of such information would divulge
information concerning processes or methods of production entitled to
protection under law as trade secrets of the user or would give advantage to
competitors and serve no public purpose, the WRA director may determine that
such information should be kept confidential and not made available for public
examination, but such information shall be available to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency or the Iowa department of natural resources.
   2.   Decisions by the WRA director to deny confidential status for
information may be appealed using the procedures in section
103.55 of this division. In determining whether information is confidential,
the provisions of Iowa Code Ch. 22 shall prevail.
   3.   Effluent data and enforcement actions by the WRA or its operating
contractor will not be considered confidential records or information.
103.55 APPEAL OF DENIAL OF CONFIDENTIAL STATUS.
   1.   Any person aggrieved by the WRA director's decision to release
information or data obtained as provided in subsection 1 of
103.54 of this division and who can demonstrate a direct and substantial
interest in the information or data sought to be kept confidential may appeal
the WRA director's decision. A request for appeal shall be filed in writing
with the WRA director not less than five days after the WRA director's decision
to deny confidential status to such information or data. The appeal request
shall include a statement of the basis upon which the request for confidential
status is made, as well as the appealing party's interest in the information or
data sought to be kept confidential. The WRA director may request additional
information from the appealing party.
   2.   Based upon the information provided by the appealing party, the WRA
director shall make a determination with respect to the confidentiality of the
information or data at issue. The WRA director shall notify the parties, in
writing, of the WRA director's decision within 7 days after receipt of the
appeal.
   3.   If still aggrieved by the WRA director's determination on appeal, a
party may file an action in Polk County district court, seeking a declaratory
ruling with respect to the confidentiality of such documents, data and
information, or seeking an injunction to prevent the disclosure of same.  
   4.   During the pendency of an appeal to the WRA director, the documents,
data or information at issue shall be kept confidential. However, if during the
pendency of such appeal, a request for examination or copying of such
documents, data or information is made of the WRA or its operating contractor
pursuant to I.C. Ch. 22, the WRA or its operating contractor will notify the
appealing party of such request for disclosure and will keep confidential the
requested documents, data or information, pending action by the appealing party
to defend its confidentiality request. In that notification, the appealing
party requesting confidentiality will be given not more than 5 calendar days
within which to file suit in Polk County district court seeking the entry of a
declaratory order and/or injunction to protect and keep confidential such
documents, data or information. If the appealing party fails to initiate suit
within the time requested, the WRA director shall release the documents, data
or information at issue for public examination.
   5.   If during the pendency of such appeal, a lawsuit is initiated pursuant
to I.C. Ch. 22 seeking the release of such documents, data or information, the
appealing party shall take action to defend its confidentiality request in said
lawsuit. If the appealing party fails to defend its confidentiality request in
said suit, the WRA director shall release the documents, data or information at
issue for public examination.
103.56 – 103.64 RESERVED
DIVISION 4: ENFORCEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER REGULATIONS
103.65 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
The WRA will annually publish, in the largest daily newspaper published in the
WRA community, a list of users who at any time during the previous 12 months
were in significant noncompliance as defined in section
103.66 of this division.
103.66 SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   1.   Any violation of pretreatment requirements under this chapter (i.e.
including but not limited to those relating to limits, sampling, analysis,
reporting, meeting compliance schedules, and regulatory deadlines) is an
instance of noncompliance for which the user is liable for enforcement,
including penalties and injunctive relief. Instances of significant
noncompliance are user violations which meet one or more of the following
criteria:
      A.   Violations of wastewater discharge limits as follows:
         (1)   Chronic violations. Sixty-six percent or more of the
measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a
six-month period (any magnitude of exceedance).
         (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations. Thirty-three percent
or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same
average limit by more than the TRC in a six-month period. (e.g., limit x TRC =
the point at which a violation becomes a TRC violation). There are two groups
of TRCs as follow:
 
Group I for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, FOG) TRC = 1.4
Group II for all other pollutants                   TRC = 1.2
 
         (3)   Any other violation of a wastewater discharge permit limit
(average or daily maximum) that the WRA director believes has caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges, interference, including slug loads, or
pass through or which endangers the health of city, WRA or operating contractor
personnel or the public.
         (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health/welfare or to the environment and has resulted in
the WRA's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge.
      B.   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, contained in a
wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order, for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance by 90 days or more after
the schedule date.
      C.   Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-monitoring
data, or any other report required by the WRA within 45 days from the due date.
      D.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
      E.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of Best Management Practices, that the WRA director considers to be
significant.
   2.   When a user is in significant noncompliance, the WRA director is
directed to:
      A.   Report the information to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
as part of the annual pretreatment performance summary of permitted user
noncompliance.
      B.   Include the user in the annual public notification according to
section
103.65 of this division.
      C.   Address significant noncompliance through appropriate enforcement
actions or document in a timely manner the reasons for withholding enforcement.
103.67 ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS.
   1.   The WRA director may issue a written notice to the user giving the
specific nature of violations which shall include the frequency, magnitude and
impact of the violation upon the POTW. The notice may also include the
following:
      A.   An order requiring a plan of action for preventing reoccurrence of
the violation.
      B.   An order requiring specific action for accomplishing remediation.
      C.   An order requiring the user to respond in writing within 30 days.
   2.   The WRA director is empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances
of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with the user responsible for any noncompliance. Such orders will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct noncompliance within a time
period specified by the order.
   3.   The WRA director may issue enforceable orders or schedules to require
compliance with pretreatment standards including appropriate interim limits.
Such orders and schedules may be incorporated as a revision to an existing
wastewater discharge permit and shall not require the consent of the user.
103.68 ACTIONS AUTHORIZED.
   1.   Where there has been noncompliance with any section of this chapter,
the WRA director may request the WRA operating contractor's attorney, or the
attorney retained by the WRA for that purpose, to bring an action in equity or
at law to seek the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both,
or such other relief as may be appropriate, to compel the user's compliance
with this chapter.
   2.   In addition to other remedies provided under this section or other
sections of this chapter, in any action brought at the request of the WRA
director to enforce this chapter, the WRA operating contractor's attorney or
the attorney retained by the WRA is authorized to seek to recover all actual
damages suffered by the city or the WRA, including all actual damages and
losses related to costs of repair and remediation of the POTW, costs of
investigation and administration reasonably related to any particular violation
and attorneys' fees.
103.69 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   1.   Each violation of any section of this chapter or of a permit issued
under this chapter is declared to be a municipal infraction. Each day that a
violation of a section of this chapter continues, and each day that a violation
of a permit issued under this chapter continues, shall be considered a separate
municipal infraction.
   2.   Any person who knowingly makes a false statement, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or a wastewater discharge
permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter, commits a municipal
infraction punishable by a civil penalty as hereafter provided by Chapter 4 of
this code.
   3.   Any person who fails to perform an act required by the provisions of
this chapter, or who commits an act prohibited by the provisions of this
chapter, commits an environmental violation and shall be guilty of a municipal
infraction, punishable by a civil penalty as provided by Chapter 4 of this
code. Violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement referred to in 40 CFR
403.8 is an environmental violation punishable by a civil penalty as provided
by Chapter 4 of this code.
State law reference(s)--Authority for enhanced penalties in pretreatment
violations, Iowa Code § 364.22(1).
103.70 PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS.
   1.   The WRA director may decline to reissue a permit to any user who has
failed to comply with this chapter or any order or previous permit issued under
this chapter unless such user first files a satisfactory bond payable to the
WRA in a sum not to exceed the value determined by the WRA director to be
necessary to achieve compliance giving due consideration to the number and
magnitude of previous violations, potential need for remediation and stating
the reasons which support the amount of the bond in a written order directed to
the user, but in no case shall the bond be required to be greater than
$100,000.00. The user shall use a bond form prescribed by the WRA.
   2.   The WRA director may require any user, including any permitted or non-
permitted waste generator which sends its wastewater by truck to the WRF, to
obtain a bond payable to the WRA with reasonable surety in a penal sum which
will adequately cover treatment costs, surcharges, fees, or any other charges
associated with discharge of wastewater to the POTW in the amount as listed in
section
103.114. The user shall use a bond form prescribed by the WRA.
(Ord. 22-23 – Dec. 22 Supp.)
103.71 REVOCATION OF DISCHARGE PERMIT; TERMINATION OF SEWER SERVICE.
   1.   Grounds for revocation of discharge permit and/or for termination of
sewer service. Any user who violates this chapter, any condition of its
wastewater discharge permit, or any of the following is subject to having its
discharge permit revoked and/or its sewer service terminated in accordance with
the procedures of this section:
      A.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
      B.   Failure of the user to report substantial changes in process
activity or in volume or character of pollutants being discharged into the POTW
at least 90 days prior to such change.
      C.   Tampering with monitoring equipment.

interference or pass through.
      J.   Failure to obtain a wastewater discharge permit as required by this
chapter after notification by the WRA director that such permit is required.
      K.   Failure to pay actual costs for negligent damage, or actual costs
and penalties charged for grossly negligent or intentional damage, to the POTW
not addressed elsewhere in this chapter.
(Ord. 22-23 – Dec. 22 Supp.)
   2.   Procedure for revocation of discharge permit and for termination of
sewer service. The procedure for revocation of a discharge permit and
termination of sewer service shall be as follows:
      A.   Any permit issued to a user pursuant to this chapter may be revoked,
and sewer service terminated, by written order of the WRA director, specifying
the grounds for such revocation and termination as outlined in subsection 1 of
this section, which order shall not take effect until hearing thereon as
hereafter provided. Upon determining that grounds exist for an order to revoke
a user's discharge permit and terminate sewer service, the WRA director shall
cause a notice of hearing to be prepared, specifying the violations of
subsection 1 of this section which are deemed to have occurred, and the time,
date and place that such hearing will be held. The notice shall be sent to the
user by regular mail addressed to the user's address listed on the wastewater
discharge permit a minimum of ten days prior to the date set for hearing, and
shall be deemed delivered when placed in the mail.
      B.   Sewer service may be terminated by written order of the WRA
director, specifying the grounds for such revocation and termination as
outlined in subsection 1 J of this section, which order shall not take effect
until hearing thereon as hereafter provided. Upon determining that grounds
exist for an order to terminate sewer service, the WRA director shall cause a
notice of hearing to be prepared, specifying the violation of subsection 1 J of
this section which is deemed to have occurred, and the time, date and place
that such hearing will be held. The notice shall be sent to the user by regular
mail addressed to the user's address a minimum of ten days prior to the date
set for hearing, and shall be deemed delivered when placed in the mail.
      C.   If after such a hearing the WRA director makes a finding based on
substantial evidence that violations under subsection 1 of this section have
occurred as alleged, the director may issue an order immediately revoking the
permit, if a permit had previously been issued, and terminating sewer service
to the user's premises. The determination to revoke such permit and terminate

103.121 TREATMENT FEES FOR HAULED WASTES.
   1.   A treatment fee shall be charged per pound of hauled waste disposed of
at the WRF and assessed based on the waste type, pollutant loading, approved
disposal location, and location of the source material. The fee for treatment
shall include electrical, chemical, labor, equipment, fuel, maintenance, and
any capital costs associated with the treatment processes utilized. The
treatment fee shall reflect a total cost per gallon or per pound of hauled
waste equaling the sum of the total cost of pollutants per gallon or per pound
plus, if applicable, total cost of flow per gallon, based on: (1) the
parameters of chemical oxygen demand (COD), estimated biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and/or total solids (TS), volatile solids
(VS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), oil and grease (O&G), and, if applicable,
total phosphorus (TP) contained in trucked waste to the WRF; (2) net weight of
the wasteload in pounds; and (3) the treatment surcharge component rate per
pound of pollutant as found in section
103.29 of this chapter. Wasteloads disposed of at an unapproved location at the
WRF, or containing pollutant concentrations different from typical pollutant
concentrations or from original disclosures made during the wasteload approval
process, may be subject to the following additional costs: treatment fees,
charges, or fines may also be applied pursuant to section
103.29.
   2.   Treatment costs shall be reviewed and updated annually per the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. The WRA shall provide 30 days’
notice prior to assessing updated disposal rates with such notices posted, at a
minimum, on the WRA website. The treatment fee for loads originating outside of
the WRA participating communities shall be 1.5 times the fee for loads
originating within the WRA participating communities unless otherwise approved
by the WRA director.
   3.   Wasteload disposal weights shall be computed and recorded at the WRF
truck scales and the resulting treatment fees shall be paid by the waste hauler
or waste generator, at the WRA’s discretion, on the basis of monthly billings
by the operating contractor. Limits of credit shall not exceed 60 days. Abuse
of such credit shall be grounds for liability on the waste hauler or waste
generator’s bond and for refusal of disposal services to any waste hauler or
waster generator under this chapter.
   4.   Waste haulers and waste generators may elect to have their routine
waste streams tested for actual concentration at their expense as set forth in
section
103.29 and as approved by the WRA director. When a waste hauler or waste
generator has elected to test for actual concentration, the treatment fee will
be based on the actual concentration whether it be higher or lower than the
average concentration treatment fee. Said testing will be done at least semi-
annually or as required by the WRA director.

104.04 Middle Creek Benefited District
 
104.01 PURPOSE.
The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a procedure
to be utilized to recover the cost of design and construction of major sanitary
sewer facilities in those instances in which a significant number of the
properties to be benefited by such facilities are not sufficiently developed to
permit the recovery of those costs through the special assessment process as
provided in Chapter 384, Division IV of the Code of Iowa. The City hereby
declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as herein provided, to recover
the costs for design and construction of such major sanitary sewer facilities
from property owners who connect to such facilities subsequent to their
construction.
104.02 INTENT.
It is the intent of this chapter to set forth the method of recovery of
proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect their
properties to major sanitary sewer facilities subsequent to their construction,
so that in the event that all property, other than street and road right-of-
way, which lies within the benefited district is connected to the major
sanitary sewer facilities during their expected useful life, then those
properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up to 100 percent of the cost for
design and construction of such facilities, including legal, administrative,
and interest expenses associated therewith.
104.03 PROCEDURE.
   1.   In the event the Council determines the necessity for construction of a
major sanitary sewer facility, and determines that the utilization of a
connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to recover the City’s
costs associated therewith, the Council shall cause a “Notice of Public Hearing
on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish a Benefited District and
a Connection Fee Schedule” to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City as hereinafter provided. In addition to indicating
the date, time, and place of the public hearing, the notice shall:
      A.   Indicate the nature and extent of the major sanitary sewer facility
or facilities under consideration for construction, as well as the estimated
cost or costs for the design and construction of same;
      B.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district to
be served by the major sanitary sewer facility or facilities; and
      C.   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by
property owners within the benefited district who connect to said facilities,
expressed in dollars per acre of land area served or such other method as the
City shall determine to be equitable for the benefited district.
The notice shall also state that the proposed connection fee ordinance is on
file, along with a plat of the area to be served, and both are available for
public inspection in the office of the Clerk. The notice shall be published not
more than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled date of the
public hearing, and shall be mailed to each property owner within the benefited
district as shown by the records of the County Auditor.
   2.   At the public hearing, the owners of property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
      A.   The necessity for the project;
      B.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major sanitary
sewer facilities;
      C.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
      D.   The proposed connection fee.
   3.   Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
      A.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
      B.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities from the proposed project and the properties served thereby from the
benefited district proposed; or
      C.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.
   4.   The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the Council’s discretion,
that single family residences within the benefited district, in existence or
under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, and located within
the corporate limits of the City, are eligible for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility. In that event, the ordinance shall include the
following provisions:
      A.   That the owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, payment of
the connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at the owner’s expense, of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the City; and
      B.   That the owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, division of
said parcel into a residence parcel and a remainder parcel, payment of the
connection fee for the residence parcel, and construction, at the owner’s
expense, of appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the
City. The connection fee for the remainder parcel shall be payable at such time
as the remainder parcel shall be connected to the major sanitary sewer
facility. For purposes of this chapter, a parcel may be divided once. For
purposes of this section, division of the property into a residence parcel and
a remainder parcel may be accomplished by submitting a drawing showing a
graphical depiction of the two parcels including dimensions accurate to within
a distance of one foot, a legal description of the entire parcel and a legal
description of the residence parcel with such accuracy as to allow the City to
determine a reasonable description of the remainder parcel. For purposes of
this section, the division of property does not require a subdivision of the
property or a plat of survey.
The connection fee ordinance may also provide, at the Council’s discretion,
that sanitary sewer service can be provided to recreational and park facilities
and to commercial and industrial parcels and facilities, in the same manner and
under the same procedures set forth in this section for single family
residences within the benefited district.
All other property located within the corporate limits of the City and within a
benefited district shall be eligible for connection to the major sanitary sewer
facility upon approval of an application for connection by the owner thereof,
as hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for such property,
provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for development, and,
where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements necessary to serve said
property have been constructed, at the owner’s expense, and accepted by the
City.
   5.   After adoption, publication and recording by the Clerk of a connection
fee ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within
the benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major sanitary
sewer facility, shall make application to the City for such connection. The
submittal of construction plans to the City for sanitary sewer improvements on
property being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to
the City for purposes of this chapter. The sewer connection fee shall be due
and payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the
major sanitary sewer facility. No connection shall be made to a major sanitary
sewer facility until such application has been approved and until the required
connection fee has been paid. The sewer connection fee shall be paid before the
City will approve the final plat of property subject to the connection fee.
   6.   The sewer connection fee shall be in an amount equal to the maximum
acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof, within the benefited
district under common ownership which can be lawfully served through such
proposed connection, multiplied by the per-acre connection fee or such other
fee basis as determined for the benefited district established in the
connection fee ordinance for that benefited district. The connection fee
ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with annual interest
adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later years pay interest
on the connection fee for their property. The rate of interest applicable to
the connection fee established in each benefited district shall not exceed the
rate of interest applicable to special assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and
Section 384.60(3) of the Iowa Code in effect on the date that the connection
fee was established for that district by enactment of a connection fee
ordinance.
   7.   Property outside of the benefited district would be eligible for
connection to a major sanitary sewer facility only upon the approval of an
application for connection by the owner thereof, a determination by the City
that sufficient capacity exists in the major sanitary sewer facility to serve
such area outside of the boundaries of the benefited district and following
payment of a fee calculated on the same basis as if the property were located
within the benefited district. Without approval of the City and payment of the
applicable fee, no property outside of the benefited district may connect to
the major sanitary sewer facility constructed to serve the benefited district.
The City may waive the requirement for payment of the applicable fee.
   8.   The sewer connection fee required by this chapter shall be due and
payable to the City and is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees
for connection required under the plumbing code or other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances.
   9.   In the event any property owner connects his or her property within a
benefited district or property outside of a benefited district to a major
sanitary sewer facility without having made application therefor or without
having received approval thereof or without having paid the required connection
fee established by a connection fee ordinance, the City shall be entitled to
disconnect such private sewer connection until such time as the property owner
has made and received approval of his or her application, and/or has paid the
required connection fee.

CHAPTER 107
BENEFITED STORMWATER DRAINAGE DISTRICTS
 
107.01 Purpose 107.03 Elizabeth Holland Park Benefited Stormwater Drainage
               District
107.02 Intent  107.04 Colonial Parkway Regional Stormwater Drainage District
 
107.01 PURPOSE.
The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a procedure
to be utilized to recover the cost of designing and constructing major
stormwater drainage facilities. In those instances in which a significant
number of the properties to be benefited by such facilities are not
sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of those costs through the
special assessment process as provided in Chapter 384, Division IV of the Code
of Iowa. The City hereby declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as
herein provided, to recover the costs of designing and constructing such major
stormwater drainage facilities from property owners who develop property within
the drainage basin where said improvements are located.
107.02 INTENT.
It is the intent of this chapter to set forth an equitable method of recovery
of proportional cost shares from those property owners within the drainage
basin, other than streets and road right-of-ways, and parks, which specifically
benefit from the facilities being constructed. A connection fee will be
collected from property owners within the drainage basin in aggregate amounts
of up to 100% of the total cost of designing and constructing major stormwater
drainage facilities, including the cost of land acquisition, legal,
administrative, and interest expenses associated therewith. When establishing a
District, the City Council may consider exempting certain properties within the
drainage basin if the property is already developed and providing for
stormwater management on site.
   1.   PROCEDURE. In the event the Council determines the necessity of
constructing a major stormwater drainage facility, and determines that the
utilization of a connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to
recover the City’s costs associated therewith, the Council shall cause a
“Notice of Public Hearing on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish
a Benefited District and a Connection Fee” to be published in a newspaper
having general circulation in the City as hereinafter provided. In addition to
indicating the date, time, and place of the public hearing, the notice shall:
      A.   Indicate the nature and extent of the major stormwater drainage
facility or facilities constructed or under construction for construction, as
well as the estimated cost or costs for the design and construction of the
same; and
      B.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district to
be served by the major stormwater drainage facility or facilities; and
      C.   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by
property owners within the benefited district who connect to and/or benefit by
the said facilities, expressed in dollars per acre of land area served or such
other method as the City shall determine to be equitable for the benefited
district.
The notice shall state that the proposed connection fee ordinance is on file,
along with a plat of the area to be served, and both are available for public
inspection in the office of the City Clerk. The notice shall be published not
more than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled date of the
public hearing, and shall be mailed to each property owner within the benefited
district as shown by the records of the County Auditor.
   2.   At the public hearing, the owners of the property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
      A.   The necessity for the project;
      B.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major
stormwater drainage facilities;
      C.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
      D.   The proposed connection fee.
   3.   Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall consider the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
      A.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
      B.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major stormwater
drainage facilities from the proposed project and the properties served thereby
from the benefited district proposed; or
      C.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.
   4.   The major stormwater drainage connection fee shall be in an amount
equal to the maximum area of contiguous property or fraction thereof within the
benefited district under common ownership which can be lawfully served through
such proposed connection, subject to the provisions of this section for
determination of the applicable area for calculation of the connection fee
multiplied by the per acre connection fee or such other fee basis as determined
for the benefited district established in the connection fee ordinance for that
benefited district. The connection fee ordinance may provide for a graduated
connection fee, with annual interest adjustments, such that property owners who
connect in later years pay interest on the connection fee for their property.
The rate of interest applicable to the connection fee established in each
benefited district shall not exceed the rate of interest applicable to special
assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and Section 384.60(3) of the Iowa Code in
effect on the date that the connection fee was established for that district by
enactment of a connection fee ordinance.
   5.   After adoption, publication and recording of a connection fee ordinance
for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within the benefited
district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who propose to
connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major stormwater drainage
facility, shall make application to the City for such connection. The submittal
of construction plans to the City for stormwater drainage improvements on
property being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to
the City for purposes of this chapter. The stormwater connection fee shall be
due and payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to
the major stormwater drainage facility. No connection shall be made to a major
stormwater drainage facility until such application has been approved and until
the required connection fee has been paid. The stormwater connection fee shall
be paid at time of final plat for residential developments and at the time of
Site Plan approval for non-residential developments.
   6.   Property outside of the benefited district would be eligible for
connection to a major stormwater drainage facility only upon the approval of an
application for connection by the owner thereof, a determination by the City
that sufficient capacity exists in the major stormwater drainage facility to
serve such area outside of the boundaries of the benefited district and
following payment of a fee calculated on the same basis as if the property were
located within the benefited district. Without approval of the City and payment
of the applicable fee, no property outside of the benefited district may
connect to the major stormwater drainage facility constructed to serve the
benefited district. The City may waive the requirement for payment of the
applicable fee.
   7.   The stormwater connection fee required by this chapter shall be due and
payable to the City and is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees
for connection required under the plumbing code or other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances.
   8.   Major stormwater drainage facilities for purposes of the connection
fees established under this chapter may include, but not limited to storm
sewers, culverts, intakes, manholes, drainage swales and channels, pump
stations, detention facilities, flood protection facilities, and river and
stream restoration or stabilization.
   9.   The following properties shall be exempt from, and not subject to, the
connection fee for major stormwater drainage facilities, unless a plat was
approved with conditions of being included in a connection fee district or the
property owner has requested to be included in the connection fee district:
      A.   Platted lots with a residential dwelling unit constructed before, or
under construction on, the effective date of the ordinance.
      B.   Residential dwellings on unplatted property constructed before, or
under construction on, the effective date of the ordinance to a maximum area of
1 acre.
      C.   Property with an approved final plat on the effective date of the
ordinance establishing the benefited district for the area where the property
is located, provided any future division of a parcel shall subject the non-
developed portion of the parcel to the connection fee.
      D.   Non-residential buildings on platted lots constructed before, or
under construction on, the effective date of the ordinance, provided any future
division of a parcel shall subject the non-developed portion of the parcel to
the applicable connection fee.
      E.   Non-residential development on an unplatted property constructed
before, or under construction on, the effective date of the ordinance.
   10.   All property shall be subject to the major stormwater drainage
connection fee as follows:
      A.   Newly platted property - the gross area of the plat less any street
right-of-way and area to be dedicated as public park.
      B.   Site Plan - the gross area of the site plan less any street right-
of-way, area to be dedicated as public park, and any area for which the
connection fee was previously paid.
   11.   In each benefited district, the City may enter into an agreement with
a property owner for the property owner to construct a designated major
stormwater drainage facility. Such agreement may provide the City to waive the
applicable connection fee to the extent of documented construction costs
incurred by the property owner to construct said major stormwater drainage
facility. Said agreement may provide that the City may reimburse the property
owner for costs of the major stormwater drainage facilities, in excess of the
waived connection fee, in an amount not to exceed the then applicable statutory
limit of the amount the City can pay to a private property owner. Such
agreement shall provide that the property owner waives and agrees not to
recover any additional costs incurred by the property owner above and beyond
the waiver of the applicable connection fee and payment as provided herein.
   12.   It is within the discretion of the City Council when to construct a
major stormwater drainage facility as designated in a benefited stormwater
drainage district. The City shall not be obligated to construct a major
stormwater drainage facility in response to any request for said stormwater
drainage facility. If a property owner requests the City to construct a major
stormwater drainage facility, the property owner, as a condition of that
request, must agree to provide all easements and access necessary for
construction of the stormwater drainage facility on property owned or
controlled by the requesting party at no cost to the City.
   13.   Any person violating the provisions of this chapter by connecting to a
major stormwater drainage facility without having complied with the provisions
of this chapter shall be punished as provided in
Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances of the City.

112.04 EQUAL PROTECTION.
In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization
or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than the
Grantee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of
constructing or operating a cable system or providing cable service to any part
of the service area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably
comparable to those contained herein, in order that one operator not be granted
an unfair competitive advantage over another and to provide all parties equal
protection under the law.
112.05 CONDITIONS OF STREET OCCUPANCY.
All transmissions and distribution structures, poles, lines and equipment
installed or erected by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be so
located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of public ways,
and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own
property which adjoins any of said public ways.
112.06 RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
If during the course of Grantee’s construction, operation or maintenance of the
cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the Grantee, the
Grantee shall, at its own expense, replace and restore such public way to a
condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the public way existing
immediately prior to such disturbance.
112.07 RELOCATION AT REQUEST OF CITY.
Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than five (5)
business days, the Grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate in the public way or remove from the public
way any property of the Grantee when lawfully required by the City by reason of
traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street
construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers,
drains, gas or water pipes or any other type of structures or improvements by

its property. If public funds are available to any company using such street,
easement or right-of-way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the
foregoing, such funds shall also be made available to the Grantee, provided
that such funds are made available by the City.
112.08 RELOCATION AT REQUEST OF THIRD PARTY.
The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the
moving of buildings, provided: (a) the expense of such temporary raising or
lowering of the wires is paid by the person requesting the same, including, if
required by the Grantee, making such payment in advance; and (b) the Grantee is
given not less than ten (10) business days’ advance notice to arrange for such
temporary wire changes.
112.09 TRIMMING OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY.
The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees and other natural growth
overhanging any of its cable system in the service area so as to prevent the
branches of the trees from coming in contact with the Grantee’s wires, cables
and other equipment. The Grantee shall be permitted to charge persons who own
or are responsible for such trees or natural growth for the cost of such
trimming, provided that similar charges are assessed by and paid to the
utilities or the City for tree trimming. The Grantee shall reasonably
compensate the City or property owner for any damages caused by such trimming
or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense, reasonably
replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any construction of the
cable system undertaken by the Grantee. Such replacement shall satisfy any and
all obligations the Grantee may have to the City or property owner pursuant to
the terms of this section.
112.10 USE OF GRANTEE’S EQUIPMENT BY CITY.
Subject to any applicable State or Federal regulations or tariffs, the City
shall have the right to make additional use, for any public purpose, of any
poles or conduits controlled or maintained exclusively by or for the Grantee in
any public way; provided that (a) such use by the City does not interfere with
a current or future use by the Grantee; (b) the City holds the Grantee harmless
against and from all claims, demands, costs or liabilities of every kind and
nature whatsoever arising out of such use of said poles or conduits, including
but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs; and (c) at Grantee’s
sole discretion, the City may be required either to pay a reasonable rental fee
or otherwise reasonably compensate Grantee for the use of such poles, conduits
or equipment; provided, however, Grantee agrees that such compensation or
charge shall not exceed those paid by it to public utilities pursuant to the
applicable pole attachment agreement or other authorization relating to the
service area.
112.11 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
Construction, installation and maintenance of the cable system shall be
performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be
performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or other Federal, State
and local regulations. The cable system shall not unreasonably endanger or
interfere with the safety of persons or property in the City.
112.12 AERIAL AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION.
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise
shall construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution
facilities underground; provided that such facilities are actually capable of
receiving Grantee’s cable and other equipment without technical degradation of
the cable system’s signal quality. In those areas of the service area where the
transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities
providing telephone communications and electric services are both aerial and
underground, the Grantee shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate
and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities or any part
thereof aerially or underground. All construction practices shall be in
accordance with all applicable sections of the National Electric Code.
112.13 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
The Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable system as necessary, as
desirable or as required pursuant to the terms hereof within the service area.
Whenever the Grantee receives a request for service from at least fifteen (15)
subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of
its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its cable system to such
subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for system extension, other than the
usual connection fees for all subscribers, provided that such extension is
technically feasible, and will not adversely affect the operation, financial
condition or market development of the cable system, or as provided for under
Section
112.14 of this chapter.
112.14 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual
circumstances, such as a subscriber’s request to locate the cable drop
underground, existence of more than one hundred fifty (150) feet of distance
from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers or a density of
less than fifteen (15) subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk
or distribution cable, cable service or other service may be made available on
the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of
material, labor and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of
capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and
subscribers in the area in which cable service may be expanded, the Grantee
will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile,
multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential
subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunk or distribution
cable and whose denominator equals fifteen (15) subscribers. Potential
subscribers will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a
pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the capital
contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid
in advance.
112.15 SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
The Grantee shall provide without charge one outlet of basic service to the
City’s office building(s), fire station(s), police station(s) and public school
building(s) that are passed by its cable system. The outlets of basic cable
service shall not be used to distribute or sell cable services in or throughout
such buildings, nor shall such outlets be located in common or public areas
open to the public. Users of such outlets shall hold Grantee harmless from any
and all liability or claims arising out of their use of such outlets, including
but not limited to those arising from copyright liability. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the Grantee shall not be
required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the
feeder cable to said buildings or premises exceeds one hundred fifty (150)
cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and so long as it will not
adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market development of
the cable system to do so, or unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees
to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 cable feet. In
the event that additional outlets of basic cable service are provided to such
buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees associated
therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials. Upon request of
the Grantee, the building owner may also be required to pay the service fees
associated with the provision of basic cable service and the additional outlets
relating thereto.
112.16 FRANCHISE FEE.
The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee equal to one percent (1%) of
basic revenues (as defined in Section
112.01 of this chapter) received by the Grantee from the operation of the cable
system on an annual basis. The franchise fee payment shall be due and payable
ninety (90) days after the close of the preceding calendar year. Each payment
shall be accompanied by a brief report from a representative of the Grantee
showing the basis for the computation. The City may request an adjustment of
the franchise fee not more than once per calendar year, provided, however, that
such request shall be made in writing and received by the Grantee no later than
July 31 of each calendar year. In the event that written notice is received by
the Grantee on or before July 31, then the franchise fee adjustment shall
commence January 1 of the following year. In no event shall the franchise fee
payments required to be paid by Grantee exceed five percent (5%) of
subscribers’ gross revenues received by Grantee in any 12-month period. The
period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall
be ten (10) years from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due. Unless
within ten (10) years from and after said payment due date the City initiates a
lawsuit for recovery of such franchise fee in a court of competent
jurisdiction, such recovery shall be barred, and the City shall be stopped from
asserting any claims whatsoever against the Grantee relating to any such
alleged deficiencies.
112.17 RATES AND CHARGES.
The City may not regulate the rates for the provision of cable service and
other services, including but not limited to ancillary charges relating
thereto, except as expressly provided herein and except as authorized pursuant
to Federal and State law including but not limited to the Cable Act and FCC
Rules and Regulations relating thereto. From time to time, and at any time,
Grantee has the right to modify its rates and charges including but not limited
to the implementation of additional charges and rates; provided, however, the
Grantee shall give notice to the City of any such modifications or additional
charges thirty (30) days prior to the effective date thereof. The Grantee shall
not provide cable service in metropolitan Des Moines, Iowa, at a charge or rate
less than the charge or rate provided in the service area. The cable service
provided in the service area will be comparable to that provided other service
areas in metropolitan Des Moines. In the event that basic cable service rate
increases are subject to approval of the City, the Grantee may, at its
discretion and without consent of the City, increase rates relating to the
provision of basic cable service by an amount which is at least equal to five
percent (5%) per year.
112.18 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the City that
relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and
comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act. In addition to the
procedures set forth in said Section 626, the City agrees to notify the Grantee
of its preliminary assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related
community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of the Grantee
under the then current franchise term. The City further agrees that such a
preliminary assessment shall be provided to the Grantee prior to the time that
the four-month period referred to in Subsection (c) of Section 626 is
considered to begin. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
section, the Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the
then current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and
opportunity to comment, the City and Grantee may agree to undertake and
finalize negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise and the
City may grant a renewal thereof.
112.19 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
The Grantee’s right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate,
without the prior consent of the City, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust,
by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title or
interest of the Grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure
indebtedness.
112.20 TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE.
The City may perform technical tests of the cable system during reasonable
times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
business operations of the Grantee or the cable system in order to determine
whether or not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and
applicable State or Federal laws. Except in emergency circumstances, such tests
may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not
to be less than two (2) business days, and providing a representative of the
Grantee an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event that such
testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially failed to comply with a
material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne
by the Grantee. In the event that such testing demonstrates that Grantee has
substantially complied with such material provisions hereof, the cost of such
testing shall be borne by the City. Except in emergency circumstances, the City
agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no more than two (2) times per
year in the aggregate, and that the results thereof shall be made available to
the Grantee upon the Grantee’s request.
112.21 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
The Grantee agrees that the City may review such of its books and records,
during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as are reasonably
necessary to monitor compliance with the terms hereof. Such records shall
include, but shall not be limited to, any public records required to be kept by
the Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Grantee shall not be
required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or
confidential in nature. The City agrees to treat any information disclosed by
the Grantee to it as confidential and only to disclose it to employees,
representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to
enforce the provisions hereof.
112.22 PERIODIC REVIEWS.
The Council may require a review for the specific purpose of determining the
community need of an educational and governmental channel. The Grantee shall
fully cooperate with the City and shall provide such non-confidential
information and documents the City may need to make its determination. In the
event the City deems an educational and governmental channel is needed in the
community, the City shall provide notice to the Grantee of this need. The City
understands the Grantee will need eighteen (18) months to budget for the
necessary technical enhancements needed to carry the channel on the cable
system.
112.23 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense,
during the term of the franchise, Comprehensive General Liability Insurance in
the amount of $1,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury and property
damage. Said insurance shall designate the City as an additional insured. Such
insurance shall be non-cancelable except upon thirty (30) days’ prior written
notice to the City.
112.24 INDEMNIFICATION.
The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless and defend the City,
its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages
and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury
(including accidental death) which arise out of the Grantee’s construction,
operation or maintenance of its cable system, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
112.25 ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION.
In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with the
terms of the franchise, it shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact
nature of the alleged noncompliance. Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from
receipt of the notice to: (a) respond to the City contesting the assertion of
noncompliance; or (b) to cure such default; or (c) in the event that, by the
nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty-day
period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of
the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. In
the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice as described herein
or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within sixty (60) days
after the Grantee is notified of the alleged default, the City shall schedule a
public meeting to investigate the default. Such public meeting shall be held at
the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Council, provided such time is not
less than five (5) business days therefrom. The City shall notify the Grantee
of the time and place of such meeting and provide the Grantee with an
opportunity to be heard. Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the
event the City, after such meeting, determines that the Grantee is in default
of any provision of the franchise, the City may:
   1.   Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under the
franchise, if any, including without limitation any bonds or other surety;
provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in such
amount as the City reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the default;
   2.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief;
   3.   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked;
   4.   Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy as an alternative to damages; or
   5.   Pursue any other legal or equitable remedies permitted by Federal and
State law.
The Grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly
with any provision of the franchise by reason of any failure of the City to
enforce prompt compliance. The Grantee shall not be held in default or
noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or
penalty relating thereto where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are
caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages or other events reasonably beyond
its ability to control.
112.26 DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED.
The following documents are incorporated herein by this reference, and in the
case of a conflict or ambiguity between or among them, the document of latest
date shall govern:
   1.   Any enabling ordinance in existence as of the date hereof;
   2.   Any franchise agreement between the Grantee and the City reflecting the
renewal of the franchise, if any.
112.27 PREEMPTION.
If the FCC or any other Federal or State body or agency exercises any paramount
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the franchise, then to the extent such
jurisdiction shall preempt and supersede or preclude the exercise of the like
jurisdiction by the City, the jurisdiction of the City shall cease and no
longer exist.
112.28 ACTIONS BY THE CITY.
In any action by the City or representative thereof mandated or permitted under
the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely
manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required
under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

119.01 PURPOSE.  
State of Iowa licensed massage therapists and businesses offering Massage
Therapy services perform an important service in addressing the health and
well-being of Norwalk residents. Unfortunately, there are businesses that
advertise they provide Massage Therapy and/or other therapeutic services, but
they engage in various illegal activities, which may include prostitution and/
or human trafficking. It is not the intention of this chapter to discourage
legitimate, licensed massage therapists or Massage Therapy Businesses from
providing their services within Norwalk. The purpose of this chapter is to
identify and address businesses that engage in the practice of Massage Therapy
without valid licenses and/or are involved in illegal activities. Businesses
providing Massage Therapy, but also conducting various types of illegal
activity, are harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of the City and
negatively impact the Massage Therapy profession. The implementation of this

businesses that engage in illegal activity.

during the time period for which a permit is issued under this chapter. In
making its request, the special event promoter shall suggest particular areas
within the City limits which the special event promoter believes would be

permits during the time period in question. If the City Council agrees with the
suggested limitation of areas for which a peddler, solicitor or transient
merchant permit may be issued during the time period for which a permit is
issued under this chapter, the City Council shall adopt a resolution providing
for the modification of the issuance of peddler, solicitor and transient
merchant permits as requested in the application hereunder. In adopting its
resolution, the City Council shall be required to find that the permitted
special event is of City-wide interest, promotes the well-being and reputation
of the City, and that the issuance of a peddler, solicitor or transient
merchant permit on a City-wide basis concurrent with the permitted special
event would detract from the benefits provided by the permitted special event.
If the City Council adopts the resolution as previously required, the exclusion
for yard sales contained in the second to the last sentence of the definition
of “transient merchant” set forth in Section
122.02(3) of this Code of Ordinances shall not be available during the time
period for which the issuance of a peddler, solicitor or transient merchant
permit is so restricted.

collector street including, but not limited to North Avenue, Main Street,
Lakewood Drive, Wakonda Drive, Wright Road, Cherry Street/Parkway, Lexington
Drive, Colonial Parkway, and Colonial Circle, shall first make application to
the City by completing a Street Closure Permit application and submitting the
application to the City Clerk’s office at least thirty (30) days prior to the
event.
   2.   The application must include a map of the specific area to be used and
blocked off from, unless otherwise agreed to by the City, cross intersection to
cross intersection. Upon submission, the application shall be brought before
the City Council for final determination regarding the granting or denial of
the permit. The Council may also place additional conditions upon the granting
of a permit to address security, sanitation or other concerns. With the
exception of certain extraordinary community events, no individual or
organization shall be allowed to make more than two applications for a street
closure in any 12-month period.
   3.   A fee, as established in
Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances, shall be submitted with each street
closure permit application.
   4.   Street closures are limited to six (6) hours; between nine o’clock (9:
00) a.m. and eleven o’clock (11:00) p.m. Sunday through Thursday, or between
nine o’clock (9:00) a.m. and twelve-thirty o’clock (12:30) a.m. Friday and
Saturday. The applicant must comply with all Federal, State, County and City
laws, ordinances and regulations, including all regulations adopted and
established by the City.
   5.   The applicant for a street closure permit shall submit an insurance
plan with the application and a certificate of insurance shall be submitted to
the City Clerk. The certificate of insurance will show one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) in liability coverage with the City named as an additional
insured.
(Ord. 19-21 – Jan. 20 Supp.)
   6.   While the granting of a street closure permit does not grant the right
to the applicant to serve beer or other alcoholic beverages upon public streets
or property, if permission is granted to the applicant, the applicant shall
also submit a separate liquor liability insurance, with a maximum of $1,000,000
per occurrence, at any time alcoholic beverages are sold or dispensed at an
event.
141.03 NEIGHBORHOOD BLOCK PARTY.
   1.   For the purpose of this section “neighborhood block party” means an
event open to a specific, defined neighborhood or area where no admission fee
is charged for attendance; where alcoholic beverages are not sold; where a
street is not closed more than six (6) hours; where the use of kybos/porta
potties is not necessary; and where no street closure permit is needed.
   2.   Any organization, private or public, or individual desiring to
exclusively use a street or part thereof for a neighborhood block party shall
complete a block party application and submit the same to the City Clerk’s
office at least thirty (30) days prior to the event. The application must
include a map of the specific area to be used and blocked off and shall, unless
otherwise directed by the City, be from cross intersection to cross
intersection so that no traffic can turn onto the closed street.
(Ord. 19-21 – Jan. 20 Supp.)
141.04 CONSENT OF NEIGHBORS.
The application for street closures and block parties shall be accompanied by a
petition designating the proposed areas of the street to be used and the time
of the proposed use. The petition shall be signed by owners representing not
less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the affected properties (commercial and
residential) abutting the area of the street to be closed. The applicants shall
provide at least 72-hour notice of the event to all residents and commercial
tenants, owners, and lessees and provide a copy to the City Clerk’s office.
141.05 BARRICADES REQUIRED.
Standard, orange and white, safety barricades are required to be erected for
both street closures and neighborhood block parties. The barricades must be
sufficient so as to completely close the street. A minimum of two per traffic
lane, evenly spaced so that vehicles are not able to detour around the closed
street segment, shall be used. Saw horses, ropes, and flags and other homemade
barricades are not permitted as alternatives. It is strongly encouraged that
someone in the group be responsible for always maintaining the proper position
of the barricades, as their mobility is a risk. For additional safety, it is
also recommended that the block party be held no less than one hundred (100)
feet inside the barricaded area. Following the event, the barricades will be
removed from the roadway or street by the applicant and the area shall be
cleared of all debris. The City can provide barricades if available.
Arrangements must be made with the Community Services Department for pickup and
return of the barricades. City staff will determine if special services are
required such as police coverage, sanitation requirements (dumpsters, porta-
potties), and other equipment.
141.06 ASSUMPTION OF RISK.
The applicant, for both street closures and neighborhood block parties, shall
exclusively assume the risk of all uses authorized by said permit including the
establishment of barricades, restoration of streets or property used, policing
of said property, injuries, medical insurance and all matters that may arise
directly or indirectly with reference to the aforesaid uses and shall hold the
City harmless from any claims, causes of action commenced or alleged by reason
of any of the activities of the applicant or permit holder as the case may be.
141.07 VIOLATIONS.
In the event of the violation of the terms or a condition of the permit herein
authorized, the City of Norwalk, Iowa, through its authorized agent, may
terminate said event without notice and cancel future events with reference to
said activities, and this chapter shall not in any way be construed to
authorize interference with the enforcement of State statutes, or ordinances,
rules and regulations of the City of Norwalk, Iowa, through its authorized
personnel. The City shall not be held accountable or liable for any of its acts
with reference to enforcement or attempted enforcement of this chapter.

directed by the Public Works Director, the work permit holder shall remove all
temporary barriers and warning devices.
142.13 EMERGENCY EXCAVATION WORK.
   1.   Urgent Work. When traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the
traveling public or the public interest, require that the excavation work be
performed as emergency work, the Public Works Director shall have the authority
to order that an adequate crew and facilities be employed by the work permit
holder for twenty- four (24) hours a day until the work is completed.
   2.   Emergency Action. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent
the making of such excavations as may be necessary for the preservation of life
or property or for the urgent location of trouble in a facility, or for making
emergency repairs, provided that the person making such excavation shall apply
to the Public Works Director for such a work permit on the first working day
after such work is commenced.

or unless other arrangements are made to the satisfaction of the Public Works
Director.
   2.   The work permit holder shall support and protect all pipes, conduits,
poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the
excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect
them under, over, along or across said work. The work permit holder shall
secure approval of the method of support and protection from the owner of the
facility. In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or apparatus or
any substructures or facility should be damaged, including any pipe coating or
other encasement or devices, the work permit holder shall promptly notify the
owner thereof.
   3.   All facilities damaged by the work permit holder shall be repaired by
the agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be paid
by the work permit holder. It is the intent of this chapter that the work
permit holder shall assume all liability for damage to facilities or
substructures and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such
facility or substructure damage and such assumption of liability is a
contractual obligation of the work permit holder.
   4.   The only exception shall be such instances where damage is exclusively
due to the negligence of the owning utility. The City shall not be made a party
to any action because of this chapter.
   5.   The work permit holder is responsible for researching the existence and
location of all underground facilities and substructures and for protecting the
same against damage.
142.17 ABANDONMENT OF SUBSTRUCTURES.

this chapter and order that all work stop for any one or all of the following
reasons:
   1.   For conducting or accomplishing permitted work in such a manner as to
materially and adversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons
residing in, owning property in, or working in the neighborhood of the property
where such work has occurred.
   2.   For conducting or accomplishing permitted work in a manner that is
materially detrimental to the public welfare, or other property, or
improvements within the neighborhood or the City.
   3.   For violation or failure to comply with any provision of this chapter.
142.19 APPEAL.
   1.   Any person aggrieved by an order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Public Works Director in the enforcement of this chapter
may, within thirty (30) calendar days thereof, appeal such action to the
Utility Advisory Commission by filing with the City Clerk an appeal specifying
the grounds thereof. The Public Works Director shall forthwith transmit to the
Utility Advisory Commission all papers constituting the record upon which the

The failure of City officials to observe or foresee hazardous or unsightly
conditions, or to impose other additional conditions or requirements on
approved applicants or work permit holder, or to deny or revoke a work permit
or approval, or to stop work in violation of this chapter, shall not relieve
the work permit holders of the consequences of their actions or inactions or
result in the City, its officers or agents, being liable therefor, or on
account thereof.

SITE GRADING REGULATIONS
 
145.01 Purpose       145.05 Requirements
145.02 Applicability 145.06 Grading Standards
145.03 Exempted Work 145.07 Drainage Standards
145.04 Procedures    145.08 Application Fee
 
145.01 PURPOSE.
This chapter sets forth rules and regulations to control grading, which
includes excavation, grading, and earthwork construction, including fills and
embankments as well as removal of trees and shrubs; establishes the
administrative procedure for issuance and review of permits; and provides for
approval of plans and inspection of grading construction.
145.02 APPLICABILITY.
Property which is part of a development project subject to site plan review,
subdivision or special use permit which has been approved by the City is exempt
from this chapter, except that no grading, unless specifically exempted by this
chapter, shall occur on the subject property prior to obtaining approval of the
development plan. Grading activities on property which is not part of an
approved development project subject to site plan review, subdivision or
special use permit, shall be subject to the grading review process described in
Section
145.04. No grading, unless specifically exempted by this chapter, shall occur
on the subject property prior to obtaining a grading permit.
145.03 EXEMPTED WORK.
A grading permit is not required for any of the following work which is carried
out on an individual tract or on a single lot within a subdivision:
   1.   An excavation below finished grade for basements and footings of a
building, retaining wall or other structure authorized by a valid building
permit. This shall not exempt any fill made with the material from such
excavation or exempt any excavation having an unsupported height greater than
five (5) feet after the completion of such structure.
   2.   Cemetery graves.
   3.   Excavations for utilities.
   4.   Excavating or stockpiling of rock, sand, gravel, aggregate, or clay
where established and provided for by law, provided such operations do not
affect a lateral support or increase the stresses upon any adjacent or
contiguous property.
   5.   Gardening and landscaping.
   6.   Exploratory excavations under the direction of soil engineers,
engineering geologists, or in connection with an environmental, archaeological,
or paleontological investigation, or mitigation.
   7.   An excavation which is less than two (2) feet in depth or which does
not create a cut slope greater than five (5) feet in height and steeper than
one and one-half horizontal to one vertical.
   8.   A fill less than one foot in depth and placed on natural terrain with a
slope flatter than five horizontal to one vertical or less than three (3) feet
in depth, not intended to support structures, which does not exceed fifty (50)
cubic yards on any one lot and does not obstruct a drainage course.
   9.   Any City, County, State or Federal improvement project which has been
approved by the City.
   10.   Agricultural drainage improvements including farm ponds.
145.04 PROCEDURES.
No person shall perform any grading or excavation on property that is not part
of an approved development project until such person has obtained grading
review approval and received a grading permit. The applicant shall submit the
appropriate filing fee and application for a grading permit on forms provided
by the City. All grading permit applications, along with all requested site
plans, engineering reports or other supporting documents, are subject to review
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and shall be issued by the Zoning
Administrator. All permits are subject to existing Federal laws and
regulations, State statutes and regulations, City policies and ordinances, and
other applicable laws.
145.05 REQUIREMENTS.
All site grading work and grading permit requirements shall be in accordance
with the International Building Code and the Statewide Urban Design and
Specifications (SUDAS) and City Design Standards. Should there be a conflict
between any of these ordinances or standards, the most restrictive provision
shall be followed.
145.06 GRADING STANDARDS.
   1.   In general, property shall be graded so that it drains to an approved
piping or drainage system or street approved by the City. Alternative drainage
will only be allowed where, due to existing topography, street drainage would
be very difficult to achieve and would not be feasible as determined by the
City.
   2.   No excavation or grading shall be done on property which causes the
removal of earth from the property which limits the City’s ability to develop
the property pursuant to its comprehensive plan.
   3.   All proposed developments shall be graded so that storm water runoff is
directed away from proposed building sites to an approved piping system, to
swales in drainage easements along property lines, to public rights-of-way, or
to another approved drainage course as determined by the City.
   4.   No storm water runoff from a development shall flow onto other adjacent
lands in a higher volume, with greater velocity or in a different location than
under natural conditions if so doing may cause damage to the adjacent land.
   5.   The property owner shall design for overland flow of storm water from
adjacent properties where the existing off site land slopes to the site.
   6.   Grading plans shall, to the greatest extent possible, maintain the
natural gradient and contours of the site and include measures to preserve
natural features including, but not limited to, trees, natural swales, and rock
outcrops. Manufactured slopes shall be rounded and shaped to simulate the
natural terrain. No manufactured slope shall have a slope steeper than three
(3) horizontal to one (1) vertical (3:1). Shallower slope angles may be
required if detailed soils and geologic investigations indicate such.
   7.   No filling will be allowed on lands which lie either wholly or in part
within the flood plain of a river, stream, creek or lake unless such fill is
approved under the terms of a permit granted by the applicable Federal, State
or County agency or the City.
   8.   Trees and shrubs within the proposed subdivision or property to be
graded shall be saved whenever feasible as determined by the City. Protective
fences shall be placed and maintained around the drip lines of trees or other
measures instituted so as to protect trees and shrubs including their root
systems during period of excavation or construction activities. Cutting and
filling soil within the drip line of a tree shall be prohibited. Soil
compaction caused by any type of equipment shall not be allowed to occur over
the root zone of trees to be saved.
   9.   Temporary erosion control measures, acceptable to the City, shall be
installed prior to any vegetation disturbance with approved permanent erosion
control measures to follow immediately thereafter. Temporary and permanent
erosion control measures shall be maintained at all times.
   10.   In order to minimize a “stair step” effect on streetscapes, the
transitional slope areas along the side lot lines in the front yard shall be
softened by reducing the slope or by contouring the top and toe of the slope
into the front yards of each lot.
145.07 DRAINAGE STANDARDS.
   1.   To the maximum feasible extent, all natural drainage courses serving
major drainage areas and containing significant vegetation which may constitute
a significant wildlife habitat, as determined by the City, should remain in
their natural state. Alterations to the above drainage courses may be allowed
if the application of this section will result in upstream or downstream
flooding hazards for which there is no other feasible means of mitigation
consistent with the findings.
   2.   All grading work in drainage facilities shall be in accordance with the
City’s Design Standards.
   3.   The overall drainage system shall be completed and made operational at
the earliest possible time during construction or shall otherwise be provided
for in a manner acceptable to the City. If a development is to be phased, the
approved drainage facilities will be completed or otherwise provided for in a
manner acceptable to the City before the completion of the first phase.
   4.   A drainage plan, including text, maps and diagrams, may be required as
part of any formal application for development under these regulations. The
City shall review these submissions for completeness, adequacy and conformance
with applicable standards.
145.08 APPLICATION FEE.
The fee for a grading permit shall be as established in
Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances.

CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
 
165.01 Findings              165.05 Enforcement
165.02 Application Procedure 165.06 Hold Harmless
165.03 Inspection Procedures 165.07 Appeal
165.04 Monitoring Procedures
 
165.01 FINDINGS.
   1.   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(“NPDES”) permit program (Program) administered by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of storm water from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)
(MS4 Permit). The City of Norwalk (City) is subject to the Program and is
required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 Permit; the City’s MS4 Permit is
on file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection
during regular office hours.
   2.   The Program requires certain individuals engaged in construction
activities (applicant or applicants) to submit an application to the IDNR for a
State NPDES General Permit #2. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter,
every applicant bears final and complete responsibility for compliance with a
State NPDES General Permit #2 and a City Construction Site Erosion and Sediment
Control (COSESCO) Permit and any other requirement of State or Federal law or
administrative rule.
   3.   As a condition of the City’s MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to
undertake primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the
Program by adopting a COSESCO ordinance designed to achieve the following
objectives:
      A.   Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation,
state agency or political subdivision (“applicant”) required by law or
administrative rule to apply to the IDNR for a State NPDES General Permit #2
shall also be required to obtain from the City a CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND
SEDIMENT CONTROL permit (City COSESCO Permit) in addition to and not in lieu of
the State NPDES General Permit #2; and
      B.   The City shall have primary responsibility for inspection,
monitoring and enforcement procedures to promote applicants’ compliance with
State NPDES General Permits #2 and City COSESCO Permits.
   4.   No State or Federal funds have been made available to assist the City
in administering and enforcing the Program. Accordingly, the City shall fund
its application, inspection, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities
entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to
the Program by virtue of State and Federal law, and/or other sources of funding
established by a separate ordinance.
   5.   Terms used in this chapter shall have the meanings specified in the
Program.
165.02 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   1.   All persons required by law or administrative rule to obtain a State
NPDES General Permit #2 from the IDNR are required to obtain a City COSESCO
Permit.
   2.   Applications for City COSESCO Permits shall be made on forms approved
by the City.
   3.   An applicant for a City COSESCO Permit shall pay fees as follows:
      A.   An application fee at the time of application as established in
Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances.
      B.   For each additional inspection required by this chapter, the
applicant shall pay an inspection fee as established in
Chapter 177 of this Code of Ordinances.
      C.   Failure of the applicant to pay an inspection fee within thirty (30)
days of billing shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   4.   An applicant in possession of a State NPDES General Permit #2 issued by
the IDNR shall immediately submit to the City full copies of the materials
described below as a basis for the City to determine whether to issue a City
COSESCO Permit:
      A.   Applicant’s plans, specifications and supporting materials
previously submitted to the IDNR in support of applicant’s application for the
State NPDES General Permit #2;
      B.   Applicant’s authorizations issued pursuant to applicant’s State
NPDES General Permit #2; and
      C.   A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) prepared in
accordance with this chapter.
   5.   Every SWPPP submitted to the City in support of an application for a
City COSESCO Permit:
      A.   Shall comply with all current minimum mandatory requirements for
SWPPPs promulgated by the IDNR in connection with issuance of a State NPDES
General Permit #2; and
      B.   Shall, if the applicant is required by law to file a Joint
Application Form, PROTECTING IOWA WATERS, IOWA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
AND U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, comply with all mandatory minimum
requirements pertaining to such applications; and
      C.   Shall comply with all other applicable State or Federal permit
requirements in existence at the time of application; and
      D.   Shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer or landscape
architect or a professional in erosion and sediment control or a representative
of the local Soil and Water Conservation District, credentialed in a manner
acceptable to the City; and
      E.   Shall include within the SWPPP a signed and dated certification by
the person preparing the SWPPP that the SWPPP complies with all requirements of
this chapter.
   6.   In addition to the SWPPP requirements stated in subsection 5
immediately above which constitute minimum mandatory requirements imposed by
the Program, every SWPPP submitted to the City in support of an application for
a City COSESCO Permit shall comply with the Statewide Urban Design and
Specifications (SUDAS) standard design criteria, including but not limited to
design, location, and phased implementation of effective, practicable storm
water pollution prevention measures, and shall also:
      A.   Assure that all temporary erosion and sediment controls shall not be
removed until the City has determined that the site has been permanently
stabilized; and
      B.   Assure that all disturbed sites be permanently stabilized with 70%
perennial cover as measured by the USDA line transect method; and
      C.   Identify methods to prevent sediment damage to adjacent properties
and sensitive environmental areas such as water bodies, plant communities,
rare, threatened and/or endangered species habitat, wildlife corridors,
greenways, etc.; and
      D.   Include measures to control the quantity and quality of storm water
leaving a site before, during and after construction; and
      E.   Provide for stabilization of all waterways and outlets; and
      F.   Protect storm sewer infrastructure from sediment loading/plugging;
and
      G.   Specify precautions to be taken to contain sediment when working in
or crossing water bodies; and
      H.   Assure stabilization of disturbed areas, including utility
construction areas, as soon as possible; and
      I.   Protect outlying roads from sediment and mud from construction site
activities, including tracking; and
      J.   Provide for disposal of collected sediment and floating debris; and
      K.   Assure that when working near sensitive waters, the specific
practices itemized immediately below are utilized:
         (1)   During construction:
            a.   All exposed soil areas with a slope of 3:1 or steeper, that
have a continuous positive slope to a sensitive water, should have temporary
erosion protection or permanent cover within three (3) days after the area is
no longer actively being worked; all other slopes that have a continuous
positive slope to a sensitive water should have temporary erosion protection or
permanent cover within seven (7) days after the area is no longer actively
being worked, and
            b.   Temporary sediment basin requirements should be used for
common drainage locations that serve an area with five (5) or more acres
disturbed at one time; and
         (2)   Buffer zone : provide for the maintenance at all times of an
undisturbed buffer zone consisting of not less than 20 linear feet from the
special water (not including tributaries); exceptions from this for areas, such
as water crossings or limited water access, are allowed if the applicant fully
documents in the SWPPP the circumstances and reasons that the buffer
encroachment is necessary; all potential water quality, scenic and other
environmental impacts of these exceptions should be minimized and documented in
the SWPPP for the project; and
         (3)   Enhanced temperature controls: design the permanent storm water
management system such that the discharge from the project will minimize any
increase in the temperature.
            a.   Minimize new impervious surfaces; and/or
            b.   Other methods that will minimize any increase in the
temperature of the sensitive waters.
   7.   Issuance by the City of a City COSESCO Permit shall be a condition
precedent for the issuance of a City building permit or site plan approval.
   8.   For so long as a construction site is subject to a State NPDES General
Permit #2 or a City COSESCO Permit, the applicant shall provide the City with
current information as follows:
      A.   The name, address and telephone number of the person on site
designated by the owner who is knowledgeable and experienced in erosion and
sediment control and who will oversee compliance with the State NPDES General
Permit #2 and the City COSESCO Permit;
      B.   The name(s), address(es) and telephone number(s) of the contractor
(s) and/or subcontractors(s) that will implement each erosion and sediment
control measure identified in the SWPPP.
      C.   Applicant’s failure to provide current information shall constitute
a violation of this chapter.
   9.   Developers can transfer State NPDES General Permit #2 and the City
COSESCO Permit responsibility to homebuilders, new lot owners, contractors and
subcontractors. Transferees must agree to the transfer in writing, must agree
to fulfill all obligations of the SWPPP, the State NPDES General Permit #2 and
the City COSESCO Permit. Absent such written confirmation of transfer of
obligations, the developer remains responsible for compliance on any lot that
has been sold. A developer shall notify the City of any application to the DNR
for release of any property from a General Permit #2 pursuant to 567 IAC 64.6
(b) or any similar successor provision.
   10.   Upon receipt of an application for a City COSESCO Permit, the City
shall either find that the application complies with this chapter and issue a
City COSESCO Permit in accordance with this chapter, or that the application
fails to comply with this chapter, in which case the City shall provide a bill
of particulars identifying non-compliant elements of the application.
165.03 INSPECTION PROCEDURES.

POST-CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
 
166.01 Findings and Purpose            166.03 Maintenance and Repair of Storm
                                       Water Facilities
166.02 Procedure for Post-Construction 166.04 Enforcement by Legal or
                                       Administrative Action
 
166.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The U.S. EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(“NPDES”) permit program (“Program”) administered by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of storm water from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4).
The City's MS4 Permit is on file at the office of the City Clerk and is
available for public inspection during regular office hours.
   2.   As a condition of the City's MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to
develop, implement, and enforce a program to address storm water runoff from
new construction and reconstruction projects for which State NPDES General
Permit #2 storm water permit coverage is required by adopting a Post-
Construction Storm Water Management Ordinance designed:
      A.   To require water quality and quantity components be considered in
the design of new construction and implemented when practical; and
      B.   To promote the use of storm water detention and retention, grass
swales, buffer strips, and proper operation and maintenance of these
facilities; and
      C.   To allow use of bio-retention swales and riparian buffers where
practical and the soils and topography are suitable to ensure such measures
will be effective in accomplishing the purpose of this chapter; and
      D.   To prohibit construction activities from commencing until the plans
for post-construction runoff controls have been submitted to the City; and
      E.   To allow the City to have the ability to access private property for
the purpose of enforcement procedures to promote compliance with the State
NPDES General Permits #2 which require post-construction compliance by
applicants.
   3.   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the City
with inspections, monitoring and/or enforcing the Program. Accordingly, the
City shall fund its inspection, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities
entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to
the Program by virtue of state and federal law, and/or other sources of funding
established by a separate ordinance.
   4.   For use in this chapter the term “applicant” means any person, firm, or
entity applying for a permit to develop, grade, or construct within the
corporate limits of the City.
166.02 PROCEDURE FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION.
   1.   Each applicant who is required to have coverage under General Permit
No. 2 for a site shall install post-construction storm water management
facilities as set forth herein and as approved by the City during site plan,
platting, or construction plans.
   2.   Each applicant or its successor person(s) or entity shall be
responsible for maintaining all storm water management facilities as approved
by the City.
   3.   For sites equal to or greater than one acre, each applicant must
provide to the City as-built plans detailing dimensions and elevations as well
as a certification that storm water management facilities were built as part of
the approved development that includes the site. For sites less than one acre
that are part of a common plan of development and for which the applicant
establishes that storm water management facilities were or will be built to
address all properties (either collectively or individually) within the
development, each applicant must provide to the City a copy of the Notice of
Discontinuation for General Permit No. 2 applicable to the property.
   4.   Each applicant must include in their site design those storm water
management facilities that will convey drainage through the property to one or
more detention and/or treatment areas such that no development shall cause
downstream property owners, water courses, channels, or conduits to receive
storm water runoff from the proposed development site at a peak flow rate
greater than that allowed by the policy or standard in effect at the time of
approval of the development unless such requirements are waived by the City.
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the City from changing the policies or
standards in the future, nor from requiring the site to comply with the new
requirements.
   5.   Each applicant shall comply with all other applicable City, state or
federal permit requirements as they apply to the City or the property.
   6.   At the discretion of the City, the applicant may satisfy the post-
construction storm water management requirements by ensuring the conveyance of
the storm water discharge from the property to a regional detention facility.
For purposes of this chapter, a “regional detention facility” shall be wet or
dry detention basins, which are designed to accept storm water runoff from two
or more sites that are required to obtain a State NPDES General Permit No. 2
and that otherwise complies with all City, state or federal permit requirements
as they apply to storm water management requirements for those sites.
166.03 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STORM WATER FACILITIES.
   1.   Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a storm water management
facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of
the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on
all subsequent owners of land served by the storm water management facility.
The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for
periodic inspection by the City, or its contractor or agent, to ensure that the
facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and
any other provisions established by this chapter. The easement agreement shall
be recorded by the City in the land records.
   2.   Maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be ensured
through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by
the City and recorded into the land record at the time of final plat approval.
As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often
maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the storm water management
facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections by the
applicant, owner, or assigns to ensure proper performance of the facility.
   3.   The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect any property subject
to regulation under this section as often as is necessary to document
maintenance and repair needs and determine compliance with the requirements of
this chapter. If a responsible party owning, controlling or possessing a
property has security measures that require identification and clearance before
entry to its property, such responsible party shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access by the City. By way of specification but not
limitation:
      A.   A responsible party shall allow the City ready access to all parts
of the property for purposes of inspection, examination, and copying of records
related to compliance with this chapter.
      B.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction that obstructs the safe and
easy access to property to be inspected shall be promptly removed by the
responsible party at the written or oral order of the City and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the responsible
party.
      C.   An unreasonable delay in allowing the City access to a property is a
violation of this chapter.
   4.   Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a storm water
management facility shall make records of the installation and of all
maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least three (3)
years. Copies of the as-built plans and records of all self inspections,
maintenance, and repairs shall be kept on-site and shall be made available to
the City during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon
request.
   5.   In the event that a storm water management facility is found by the
City to be non-compliant with the plans as submitted and approved or is found
to be in need of maintenance, the responsible party will be notified in writing
of such deficiencies. Upon receipt of such notice, the responsible party shall
have fifteen (15) days to correct such deficiencies. After proper notice, and
if the responsible party fails to make the repairs or perform the maintenance,
the City may have such work performed and assess the owner(s) of the facility
for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall
be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the
property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by
the City.
166.04 ENFORCEMENT BY LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.
Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any particular
provision or section, any responsible party violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall be subject
to the civil penalties set forth in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances. Violation of any provision of this
chapter may also be enforced by action for injunctive relief.

discontinue the imposition of the extraneous flow charges for that sanitary
sewer customer and shall refund previous payments. Such refund shall be limited
to the number of monthly payments made or three (3) months, whichever is
smaller.
167.12 INSPECTION AND NOTICE.
The City may conduct periodic inspections of properties to confirm there are no
direct or indirect connections of the foundation drain to the sanitary sewer
system. If during an inspection the City determines there is a direct or
indirect connection as a result of a modification of the system to allow for a
direct or indirect connection, failure to maintain or replace a failed sump
pump that would allow an indirect or direct connection to the sanitary sewer
system, or such other cause as may allow a direct or indirect connection, the
City shall provide the property owner a written notice. The property owner
shall be provided thirty (30) days to cure the defect and to arrange for a re-
inspection by the City. If at the end of thirty (30) days the direct or
indirect connection has not been inspected and determined to have been removed,
the property shall be subject to the extraneous flow charge provisions under
this chapter. The payment shall continue until such time as the City determines
through inspection the direct or indirect foundation drain connection no longer
exists.

caused to be inspected any building and has found and determined that such
building is an unsafe or abandoned building, the Code Official shall commence
proceedings to cause the repair, vacation, or demolition of the building.
   2.   Notice and Order. The Code Official shall issue a notice and order
directed to the owner of the building. The notice and order shall contain:
      A.   The street address and a legal description sufficient for

structure shall be vacated within a time certain from the date of the order as
determined by the Code Official.

order; and that the demolition be completed within such time as the Code
Official shall determine is reasonable (not to exceed ninety days).
      D.   Statement advising that if any required repair or demolition work

cause the work to be done and charge the costs thereof against the property or
its owner.
      E.   Statement advising (i) that any person having any record title or
other legal interest in the building may appeal from the notice and order or

made in writing as provided in this chapter and filed with the Code Official
within fifteen (15) days from the date of service of such notice and order and/

record in the County Recorder’s office or elsewhere, either by certified mail
or personal service. Additionally, the property shall be placarded as an unsafe
or abandoned building. Should all reasonable attempts consistent with due
process of law to serve, locate, or ascertain all owners of record fail,
placarding the property shall be deemed adequate and legal notice to all such
persons. The inability of the Code Official to serve any owner or owners of
record shall not invalidate any proceedings hereunder as to any other person
duly served or relieve any person not served from any duty or obligation
imposed by the provisions of this chapter.
   4.   Method of Service. Service by certified mail in the manner herein
provided shall be effective on the date of mailing and service by placarding

time, date, and manner in which service was made. The declaration, together

Official. Proof of personal service shall be made by attaching a return of
service form executed in compliance with the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure
affixed to the copy of the notice and order retained by the Code Official.

order within the time specified therein, and no appeal has been properly and
timely filed, the Code Official shall file in the office of the County Recorder
a certificate describing the property and certifying (i) that the building is
an unsafe or abandoned building and (ii) that all owners of record have been
notified. Whenever the corrections ordered shall thereafter have been completed
or the building demolished so that it no longer exists as a dangerous building
on the property described in the certificate, the Code Official shall file a
new certificate with the County Recorder certifying that the building has been
demolished or all required corrections have been made so that the building is
no longer dangerous, whichever is appropriate.
   7.   Repair, Vacation and Demolition. The following standards shall be
followed by the Code Official (and by the Board of Appeals if an appeal is
taken) in ordering the repair, vacation, or demolition of any dangerous

include a notification thereof in the notice and order issued. No person shall
remain in or enter any building which has been so posted, except that entry may
be made to repair, demolish, or remove such building under permit. No person
shall remove or deface any such notice after it is posted until the required
repairs, demolition, or removal has been completed and a certificate of
occupancy issued pursuant to the provisions of the Building Code.

175A.07   ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
The boundaries of the Zoning Districts are indicated upon the Official Zoning
Map of the City of Norwalk, Iowa, which is made a part of this ordinance by
reference. The Official Zoning Map and all notations, references and other
matters shown thereon shall be as much a part of this ordinance as if the
notations, references and other matters set forth by said map were all fully
described herein; the original of which is properly attested to and is on file
in the Office of the City Clerk, of the City of Norwalk, Iowa. The City Council
may from time to time amend the Official Zoning Map or adopt a new Official
Zoning Map, which shall supersede the prior Map, in the event the Official
Zoning Map becomes damaged or destroyed, or for purposes of clarity due to a
number of boundary changes, or to correct drafting errors or omissions;
provided, however, that any such adoption shall not have the effect of amending
this zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof. The district
boundaries are either lot lines or the centerlines of streets and alleys,
unless otherwise shown. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of
districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   1.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways, alleys, or other public rights-of-way shall be construed to
follow such centerlines.
   2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall
be construed as following such lot lines.
   3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following corporate limits shall
be construed as following corporate limits.
   4.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following section lines, quarter
section lines, or quarter-quarter section lines shall be construed as following
such lines.
   5.   Boundaries indicated, as following railroad lines shall be construed to
be the centerline of the railroad right-of-way.
   6.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
rivers, streams, creeks or other waterways shall be construed to follow such
centerlines.
   7.   Boundaries not capable of being determined in the previous paragraphs
shall be as dimensioned on the Official Zoning Map or if not dimensioned shall
be determined by the scale shown on the map.
175A.08   ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
Except as hereinafter specified within Sections 175A.13, 175A.14, 175A.15,
175A.16, 175A.17, and 175A.18, no building or structure shall be erected,
converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered, nor shall any
building or land be used or site improved, or land subdivided, which does not
comply with all of the district regulations established by this ordinance for
the district in which the building or land is located.
175A.09   ENFORCEMENT BY ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
There is hereby created the position of Zoning Administrator who shall be
appointed by the Mayor subject to confirmation by the City Council. The Zoning
Administrator shall administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance and
shall have the following powers and duties, in connection therewith:
   1.   The Zoning Administrator shall issue all permits and certificates
required and authorized by this ordinance.
   2.   If the Zoning Administrator shall find that any of the provisions of
this ordinance are being violated, he or she shall notify in writing the person
(s) responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the violation,
and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Zoning Administrator shall
order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or structures; removal
of illegal buildings, structures, or signs; or additions, alterations, or
structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or
shall take any other action authorized by this ordinance to insure compliance
with or to prevent violation of this ordinance.
   3.   The Council may, by resolution approved by a majority vote of the
entire Council, delegate the powers and duties of the office of Zoning
Administrator to any officer or employee of the City or may combine the powers
and duties of the Zoning Administrator with any other office or position.
175A.10   CONFIRMATION OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.
No land shall be occupied or used, and no building hereafter erected or
structurally altered shall be occupied or used in whole or in part for any
purpose whatsoever, until there is a Confirmation of Compliance with Zoning
Regulations issued by the Zoning Administrator, stating that the use of the
building and the site improvements comply with the provisions of this
ordinance. Any change of site improvements not conforming to the current and
approved site plan for the property or change of use shall not be made on any
land, in any building or part thereof, existing or hereafter erected or
structurally altered, without a Zoning Certificate being issued by the Zoning
Administrator. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued unless the uses,
buildings and site improvements are in conformity with provisions of this
ordinance. No building or premises shall be occupied until a Certificate of
Occupancy has been issued. Application for building permits and Certificates of
Occupancy shall be signed by the Zoning Administrator to confirm zoning
compliance and conformity to the provisions of this ordinance. Nothing in this
section shall prevent the continuance of a nonconforming use, building or site
improvements as herein authorized, unless a discontinuance is necessary for the
safety of life or property.   Any change of use, which occurs without the need
to apply for a building permit or site plan application, shall obtain a letter
of Zoning Compliance from the City. The cost of a letter of Zoning Compliance
is contained in
Chapter 177 Rates and Fees.
(Ord. 22-30 – Dec. 22 Supp.)
175A.11   ZONING DISTRICTS DIVIDING PROPERTY.
Where one (1) parcel of property has two (2) or more portions covered by
different zoning districts, each of these portions shall comply with the
regulations of its respective zoning district.
175A.12   ANNEXATION OF TERRITORY.
All property that may hereafter be annexed into the City shall be zoned A-R,
Agricultural Reserve District unless otherwise designated by the City Council
in accordance with the City of Norwalk Comprehensive Plan.
175A.13   CONTINUING AN EXISTING USE OR STRUCTURE.
The lawful use of land or structures existing on the beginning date of
enforcement of this ordinance, January 1, 1998, or at the date of a subsequent
amendment to this ordinance may be continued, even though such use or structure
may not conform with the regulations of this ordinance, or amendment thereto,
for the district in which it is located. Any use or structure in existence on
January 1, 1998, which was not a lawful nonconforming use or structure under
the previous Zoning Ordinance, shall not be authorized to continue as a
nonconforming use or structure pursuant to this ordinance, or amendments
thereto, and shall be considered an unlawful use or structure.
175A.14   NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
The lawful use of land upon which no structure is erected or located which
becomes nonconforming under the terms of this ordinance as adopted or amended
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
   1.   No such nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged or increased nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on January 1, 1998,
or at the time of an amendment of this ordinance which makes the use
nonconforming.
   2.   No such nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel which was not occupied by such use on
January 1, 1998, or at the time of an amendment of this ordinance which makes
the use nonconforming.
   3.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six (6) months, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the district regulations for the district in which such land is
located.
175A.15   NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES.
The lawful use of a structure, and adjacent land which is part of the plot upon
which the structure is located, which becomes nonconforming under the terms of
this ordinance as adopted or amended, may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   1.   Any existing structure in an R District devoted entirely, or in part,
to a use not permitted by this ordinance, or any amendment thereto, in the
district in which it is located, except when required by law, shall not be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed, relocated on the site, or structurally
altered, unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located.
   2.   Any existing structure, in any district other than an R District, which
is devoted to a use made nonconforming by this ordinance, or any amendment
thereto, may be structurally altered or enlarged in conformity with the lot
area, lot coverage, frontage, width, yard, height, and parking requirements of
the district in which it is located, provided such structural alteration or
enlargement shall be limited to structures on land owned, of record, by the
owner of the land devoted to the nonconforming use prior to January 1, 1998, or
at the time of an amendment of this ordinance which makes the use or structure
nonconforming. Such structural alteration or enlargement shall not authorize
the substitution of a nonconforming use that is less restrictive than the one
to which the structure was devoted on January 1, 1998, or at the time of an
amendment of this ordinance which makes the use or the structure nonconforming.
   3.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
structure which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use on January 1,
1998, or at the time of an amendment of this ordinance which makes the use
nonconforming. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
structure.
   4.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar nature
permitted within the same or a more restricted zoning district classification.
Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive
use.
   5.   In the event that a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and
land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a period of two (2)
years, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in
the district in which it is located. Where nonconforming use status applies to
a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
   6.   Any structure devoted to a use made non-conforming by this ordinance
that is destroyed or has damage by any means to an extent of sixty (60) percent
or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, exclusive of the
foundations, shall not be reconstructed and used as before such event. If the
structure is less than sixty (60) percent destroyed above the foundation, it
may be reconstructed and used as prior to the event, provided a building permit
is issued by the City within one (1) year of such event, and is built of like
materials, or materials conforming to architectural standards for the zoning
district in which the structure or building is located.
175A.16   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
If a structure exists on January 1, 1998, or at the time of an amendment of
this ordinance which makes such structure nonconforming, and does not comply
with the terms of this ordinance and any amendment thereto by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, setbacks, architecture, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   1.   No such building or structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
   2.   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty
(60) percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of its destruction, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
ordinance. However, such structure may be rebuilt with the same building line
as the original structure if all of the following apply:
      A.   The structure was a one or two-family residential structure.
      B.   The structure was located, at the time of destruction, in an R-1 or
R-2 district.
   3.   If the site improvements on an existing building site do not conform to
the requirements of this ordinance, the use of the site cannot be expanded or
new structure constructed, unless the site improvements are brought into
conformance with this ordinance.
   4.   A lawful nonconforming building which exists on or before January 1,
1998, may be altered or enlarged up to 100 percent of its existing size as of
January 1, 1998, in accordance with the zoning regulations and standards which
existed prior to January 1, 1998, provided such structural alteration or
enlargement shall be limited to structures on land owned, of record, by the
owner of the land devoted to the nonconforming structure prior to January 1,
1998. Any enlargement or alteration greater than 100 percent of the building
size as of January 1, 1998, shall require compliance with this ordinance.
   5.   An accessory structure lawfully in existence prior to the adoption of
this provision may be reconstructed, rebuilt, or replaced within the same
building setback line as the original structure. However, any nonconformity of
the structure cannot be increased. Any expansion from the footprint and/or
overhang of the original structure must comply with the current building
setback requirements.
175A.17   REQUIRED REPAIRS AND UNAUTHORIZED NONCONFORMITIES.
   1.   Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the restoring to a
safe condition any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such
official, provided such repair does not constitute a substantial improvement.
   2.   Any use of land, use of a structure, or structure, in existence on
January 1, 1998, which was an unlawful nonconformity under any previous zoning
ordinance or similar regulations shall not be considered “grandfathered,” and
shall not be authorized to continue its nonconforming status pursuant to this
ordinance or amendments thereto.
175A.18   PERMITS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED.
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the overall layout, plans,
construction, size, or designated use of any structure or part thereof, for
which approvals and required permits have been granted prior to January 1,
1998, or prior to an amendment to this ordinance which makes the structure
nonconforming, the construction of which in conformance with such plans shall
have been started prior to January 1, 1998, or prior to an amendment to this
ordinance which makes the structure nonconforming, and completion thereof
carried on in a normal manner and not discontinued for reasons other than those
beyond the builder’s control.
175A.19   AMENDMENTS.
The City Council may, from time to time, on its own action, upon request by the
owner of a parcel of land, or on petition, initiate the process to change the
zoning of the property and after public notice and hearings as provided by law,
and after recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, change the
zoning boundaries and classifications shown on the Official Zoning Map, or
subsequently established, and such amendment shall not become effective except
by the favorable vote of a majority of all the members of the City Council.
   1.   Procedures. Whenever any person, firm or corporation desires that any
amendment, or change be made in the Official Zoning Map, as to any property
covered by this ordinance, there shall be presented to the Council a petition
requesting such change or amendment and clearly describing the property and its
boundaries as to which the change or amendment is desired, duly signed by the
owners of fifty (50) percent or more of the area of all real estate included
within the boundaries of said tract as described in said petition, and in
addition, duly signed by the owners of fifty (50) percent or more of the area
of all real estate lying outside of said tract but within two hundred (200)
feet of the boundaries thereof; intervening streets and alleys shall not be
included in computing such two hundred (200) feet. It shall be the duty of the
Council to vote upon such petition within a reasonable time after the filing of
such petition with the City Clerk. In lieu of a petition, a property owner may
submit a written request to the City Council to initiate the rezoning of the
owner’s property. The Council may initiate a rezoning, if it is determined the
rezoning is compatible with the Comprehensive Plan, or for other reasonable
cause. Prior to voting or holding a public hearing upon the petition or request
for rezoning, the City Council shall refer the rezoning proposal to the
Planning and Zoning Commission requesting its comments and recommendations. The
Planning and Zoning Commission after public hearing, shall advise the City
Council of its recommendations and the vote thereon. In case the proposed
amendment, supplement, or change be disapproved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, or a protest be presented duly signed by the owners of twenty (20)
percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed
change, or of those immediately adjacent thereof, extending the depth of one
(1) lot or not to exceed two hundred (200) feet therefrom, such amendment shall
not become effective except by the favorable vote of at least three-fourths (3/
4) of all members of the Council. A protest, if filed, must be filed before or
at the public hearing held by the City Council. Whenever any petition or
request for amendment, or change of the zoning districts shall have been denied
by the City Council, then no new petition or request for the same zoning change
covering the same property or the same property and additional property shall
be filed with or considered by the City Council until one (1) year shall have
elapsed from the date of filing of the first petition or request.
   2.   Notice Requirement. Whenever any amendment or change is petitioned to
be made in the Official Zoning map, as to any property covered by this
ordinance, the City shall publish notice as required by the State Code of Iowa,
and notify all owners of property within the affected boundaries and all owners
of property within two hundred (200) feet. The notice of time and place of the
public hearing shall be published in accordance with state law and all property
owners are to be sent notices in accordance with state law prior to any public
hearing by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council on the
proposed zoning change. If the proposed amendment, change or alteration has a
similar impact on all of the property within the district, setback regulations,
square footage requirement, accessory uses, or other bulk regulations within a
district; or adds, deletes, or changes an entire district, notice by
publication, only shall be required. For all rezoning of property by petition
or owners request, the owner of the property shall be required to post a sign
which is 4 feet by 4 feet in size with letters of not less than four (4) inches
in height stating notice of rezoning and zoning district designations proposed
to be changed and telephone number and address of the City Zoning
Administrator. A sign shall be placed on each public street right-of-way and
shall not be greater than thirty (30) feet from the street right-of-way.
   3.   Filing Fees. Before any action shall be taken as provided in this
section, the owners of the land for which a change in the zoning has been
initiated by petition or Council action in response to a request by the owner
of the land shall pay to the City a filing fee to cover the costs of the
procedure. Under no conditions shall said fee or any part thereof be refunded
for failure of said amendment to be enacted into law. The amount of the fee for
all rezoning of land subject to a filing fee shall be in accordance with
Chapter 177, Rates and Fees, of this Code of Ordinances. Cost of mailing public
notices sent to property owners shall be paid by the petitioner.
(Ord. 19-03 – May 19 Supp.)
175A.20   BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Board Created. The Board of Adjustment, hereafter called Board,
previously created shall continue to consist of five (5) members. The terms of
office of each member of the Board shall be staggered and for five (5) years.
Each member shall be appointed by the Mayor subject to confirmation by the City
Council.
   2.   Meetings. The meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
chairperson, or in his/her absence the acting chairperson, may administer oaths
and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open
to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the
vote of each member on each question, or if absent, and failing to vote,
indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other
official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the
Board and City Clerk, and shall be a public record. The presence of three (3)
members shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.
   3.   Appeals. Appeals to the Board may be made by any person aggrieved by
any officer, department, board, or Commission of the City of Norwalk pertaining
to the enforcement of this zoning ordinance. Such appeal shall be made within
ten (10) days by filing with the Zoning Administrator a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board,
after notice of appeal shall have been filed with him or her, that by reason of
the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator
and on due cause shown. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
on the appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the
petitioner and adjoining property owner, and decide the same within a
reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney. Before an appeal is filed with the Board of Adjustment, the appellant
shall pay a fee to be credited to the general fund of the City of Norwalk in
accordance with Chapter 177, Rates and Fees, of this Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. 19-03 – May 19 Supp.)
   4.   Powers and Duties. The Board shall have the following powers and
duties:
      A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator in enforcement of this ordinance.
      B.   To grant a variation from the terms of this ordinance when a
property owner can show that their property by reason of exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property, or where by
reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or
exceptional site conditions, the strict application of the terms of this
ordinance actually prohibits the use of their property in a manner reasonably
similar to that of other property in the same district, and where the Board is
satisfied under the evidence before it that a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship; provided,
however, that all variations granted under this section shall be in harmony
with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance. In granting any
variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards,
when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted shall be
deemed a violation of this ordinance. Under no circumstances shall the Board
grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this ordinance in said district.
      C.   To permit the following exceptions to the district regulations set
forth in this ordinance, provided all exceptions shall by their design,
construction and operation adequately safeguard the health, safety, and welfare
of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding property, shall not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, shall not increase
congestion in the public streets, shall not increase public danger of fire and
safety, and shall not diminish or impair established property values in
surrounding areas.
         (1)   To permit erection and use of a building or the use of the
premises or vary the height, yard, or area regulations in any location for a
public service corporation for public utility purposes, or for purposes of
public communication, which the Board determines is reasonably necessary for
the public convenience or welfare.
         (2)   To permit the extension of a zoning district where the boundary
line of a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown of record or by
existing contract or purchase at the time of the passage of this ordinance, but
in no case shall such extension of the district boundary line exceed forty (40)
feet in any direction.
      D.   To issue permits and decide such matters as may be required by other
chapters or sections of this ordinance.
   5.   Decisions of the Board of Adjustment. In exercising the powers and
duties of the Board enumerated in this section, the Board may, in conformity
with the provisions of law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such
order, requirement, decision, or determination as it believes proper. The
concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse
any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator,
or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required
to pass under this section; provided, however, that the action of the Board
shall not become effective until after the resolution of the Board, setting
forth the full reason for its decision and vote of each member participating
therein, has been filed. Such resolution shall be filed in the office of the
Board and City Clerk, recorded at the Office of the County Recorder, and shall
be open to public inspection. Every variation and exception granted or denied
by the Board shall be supported by written testimony and evidence submitted in
connection therewith. The City Council may review appeals, variances,
exceptions or other requests granted by the Board before their effective date
and may remand a decision to grant an appeal, variance, exception or other
request to the Board for further study. Upon Council action to remand a
decision by the Board, the effective date of the decision shall be delayed for
thirty (30) days from the date of the remand. Any taxpayer or any officer,
department, board, or bureau of the City of Norwalk; or any person or persons
jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a
court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is
illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such
petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the
filing of the decision in the office of the Board, in accordance with the Code
of Iowa.
175A.21   EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
The regulations specified in this ordinance shall be subject to the following
exceptions, modifications, and interpretations:
   1.   Use of Existing Lots of Record.
      A.   In any zoning district where single-family detached dwellings are
permitted, a single family detached dwelling may be located on any lot or plot
of official record as of January 1, 1998, or at the time of an amendment of
this ordinance which makes a lot or plot non-conforming irrespective of the
lot's area or width, provided however:
         (1)   The side yard setbacks shall comply with the bulk regulations of
the R-1 zoning district classification with the largest permitted minimum lot
width less than the width of the lot of record, provided no side yard shall be
less than five (5) feet.
         (2)   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot shall not be required
to exceed twenty (20) percent of the depth of the lot, but in no case less than
twenty (20) feet at a minimum buildable depth of forty (40) feet.
      B.   In any zoning district, a building other than a single-family
detached dwelling may be located on a lot of record as of January 1, 1998, or
at the time of an amendment to this ordinance which makes a lot or plot non-
conforming, irrespective of the lot's area or width, provided however:
         (1)   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot may be reduced to no
less than twenty (20) percent of the depth of the lot, but in no case less than
twenty (20) feet, and
         (2)   The side yard setbacks may be reduced, provided the side yard
setback as a ratio of the lot of record width is not less than the ratio of the
minimum side yard setback as a ratio of the minimum lot width permitted for the
zoning district, and no side yard shall be reduced to less than five (5) feet.
   2.   Structures Permitted Above the Height Limit. The building height
limitations of this ordinance shall be modified as follows: chimneys, cooling
towers, elevator bulk-heads, fire towers, monuments, stage towers or scenery
lofts, water towers, churches, ornamental towers and spires, radio or
television towers or necessary mechanical appurtenances may be erected to a
height greater than that permitted for the zoning district in which the
structure is proposed, provided the structure is permitted in accordance with
all other conditions or regulations as set forth in this ordinance.
   3.   Area Requirements. In any residential district, where neither public or
a private multiple-user off-site water supply system, or waste water disposal
facility is accessible, the lot area and width requirements shall be as
follows, or the minimum required for the particular district, whichever is the
greater: lot area shall be ten (10) acres; provided, however, that where a
public or private multiple-user off-site water supply system is available these
requirements shall be forty thousand (40,000) square feet.
   4.   Double Frontage Lots. Buildings on double frontage lots extending from
street to street shall provide the required minimum front yard setback on the
street side where the city may determine access is permitted, and shall provide
the required minimum rear yard setback on the street frontage where the City
may determine that no vehicle access shall be permitted. The City may also
require an additional landscape buffer area within the rear yard adjacent to
the adjoining thoroughfare, in lieu of a buffer wall.
   5.   Exceptions to Yard Requirements. Every part of a required yard setback
area shall be open to the sky, unobstructed with any building or structure,
except for a permitted accessory building in the designated rear yard, and
except for the ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, cornices, chimneys,
fireplace projections, bay windows, ornamental features, roof overhangs, and
gutters that do not extend or encroach more than twenty-four (24) inches into
any required yard setback. Ground-mounted external air-conditioning or HVAC
units for residential dwellings may encroach within a side or rear yard setback
area. Uncovered steps, patios and decks may extend up to 15 feet into any front
yard setback area and up to 25 feet into any rear yard setback area, provided a
minimum fifteen (15) foot setback is maintained. No steps, patios or decks,
covered or uncovered, may extend or encroach into a required side yard setback
area. Detached canopies placed over fuel pumping facilities which are accessory
to gas stations or convenience stores may be located in the front yard,
provided a minimum fifteen (15) foot setback is maintained.
   6.   Mixed-Use Yard Requirements. In instances where buildings are erected
containing two (2) or more uses housed vertically, the required side yards for
the first floor use shall control.
175A.22   STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
Except as herein provided, no lot shall contain any building used for
residential purposes unless such lot abuts for at least forty (40) feet on a
public street. In situations of hardship, the Board of Adjustment may grant a
variance from the minimum forty (40) feet street frontage requirement, if an
exclusive unobstructed private easement of access or private right-of-way of at
least forty (40) feet wide to a street is provided for no more than one (1)
single family detached dwelling, and if a common easement of access or right-
of-way of at least sixty (60) feet wide is provided for two (2) single family
dwellings. The lot across which an easement of access is located, shall have
adequate dimensions and area, exclusive of the easement area, to meet minimum
bulk regulations for the Zoning District in which the lot is located. The
subdivision of land into flag lots shall not be permitted, except by variance,
if it is determined the property being subdivided can not be included as part
of adjoining vacant land to create a subdivision in compliance with the minimum
standards of this ordinance and the City’s subdivision ordinance. Where more
than two (2) single family or two (2) two-family dwellings could be served now
or in the future from a private easement of access or right-of-way, there shall
be a public street including public utility extensions provided in accordance
with the Norwalk Subdivision Ordinance prior to development.
175A.23   CORNER LOTS.
For corner lots, platted after the effective date of this ordinance, each
street frontage shall meet the minimum required front yard setback for the
Zoning District in which it is located, and the minimum required lot width
shall be increased by an amount not less than twenty (20) feet so as to allow
for the additional required front yard setback, i.e. for a minimum required lot
width of sixty (60) feet, the minimum width of a corner lot shall be not less
than eighty (80) feet. On corner lots platted and of record at the time of the
effective date of this ordinance, the same regulations shall apply except that
this regulation shall not be so interpreted as to reduce the buildable width of
the corner lot to less than twenty (20) feet nor to prohibit the erection of an
accessory building.
175A.24   FRONT YARD.
In any R District, there shall be a minimum front yard setback required as
stated in the yard requirements in the bulk regulations for that particular
zoning district; provided, however, that in no case shall the front yard
setback be less than the smallest front yard setback as platted or of an
existing dwelling in the same block; whichever is lesser, located within two
hundred (200) feet of either side lot line; provided, however, this regulation
shall not be interpreted as to require a greater setback than double the
minimum required front yard setback for the zoning district in which it is
located. This regulation shall not be interpreted as to permit a setback which
is less than the minimum required front yard for the zoning district in which
it is located. On any lot in any district, the depth of a front yard abutting a
major collector or arterial street shall be measured from the planned right-of-
way line based on the City’s Comprehensive Plan and subdivision ordinance to
accommodate future street widening.
175A.25   BUILDING LINES ON APPROVED PLATS.
Whenever the plat of a land subdivision approved by the City Council and on
record in the Offices of the County Recorder and County Auditor shows a minimum
setback line along any frontage for the purpose of creating a front yard, or
other building setback line, the building line thus shown shall apply along
such frontage in place of any other yard line required in this ordinance unless
specific yard requirements in this ordinance require a greater setback.
175A.26   REQUIRED YARD, OPEN SPACE, PARKING, OR LOADING SPACE CANNOT BE
REDUCED.
No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance shall be
reduced in dimension or area below the minimum required by this ordinance. No
part of a yard or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space
provided for any building, structure, or use for the purpose of complying with
the provisions of this ordinance shall be included as part of a yard, open
space, or off-street parking or loading space required under this ordinance for
another building, structure, or use. The right to use any property by way of
easement (expressed, implied, or by prescription), permit or other similar type
of conveyance or permission that will not ultimately vest title in fee simple,
except those for public utility purposes, shall not be included as part of any
yard or lot for the purpose of complying with yard setback provisions of this
ordinance.
175A.27   EXISTING TWO-FAMILY DWELLINGS RECLASSIFIED DISTRICT R-1.
Existing two-family dwellings which lawfully existed in District R-2 and were
amended to District R-1 with the amendment to this ordinance on September 4,
1997, shall be considered a lawful conforming use. Any expansion or alteration
of the two-family structures shall adhere to the bulk regulations for District
R-1.

the national electrical code.
      Y.   Removal. If the SWECS remains nonfunctional or inoperative for a
continuous period of one year, the system shall be deemed to be abandoned. The
owner/operator shall remove the abandoned system at their expense. Removal of
the system includes the entire structure, transmission equipment and fencing
from the property excluding foundations. Nonfunction or lack of operation may
be proven by reports from the interconnected utility. For off grid systems the
City shall have the right to enter the property at its sole discretion to
determine if the off grid system is generating power. Such generation may be
proven by use of an amp meter. The owner/operator and successors shall make
available to the director of development services or their designee all reports
to and from the purchaser of energy from the SWECS if requested. If removal of
towers and appurtenant facilities is required, the director of development
services or designee shall notify the owner/operator in writing.
      Z.   Right of Entrance. As a condition of approval of a permitted special
use permit an applicant seeking to install SWECS shall be required to sign a
petition and waiver agreement which shall be recorded and run with the land

Master Plan and development guidelines and standards in which the land uses,
transportation elements, building densities, arrangements, and types are set
out in a unified plan, which may provide greater flexibility of land use,
transfer of development rights within the PUD, bulk regulations, and building
locations than the conventional zoning district may permit. The PUD District is
intended to: maximize benefits from the use of open spaces; maximize
aesthetics; encourage certain architectural standards for buildings, permit
mixed uses and diversity of bulk regulations without endangering the health,
safety, welfare, and land value of surrounding and internal properties. A PUD
may consist of a mix of land uses of residential building types, commercial,
and limited industrial, provided such Planned Unit Development is compatible
with the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
   2.   Minimum Size, Land Use and Maximum Density. A PUD shall consist of at
least ten (10) acres, land use types compatible with the Comprehensive Plan of
the City, and the density of the PUD shall not be in excess of the density
permitted by this section and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan. A Planned
Unit Development may include multiple-family or two-family dwellings in areas
designated as R-1 zoning in the Comprehensive Plan, if the proposed land use is
compatible with land uses adjoining and outside the PUD, and the dwelling unit
density of the PUD is not greater than ten percent (10%) greater than the
maximum density permitted by the underlying zoning as set forth in this sub-
section. The maximum number of dwelling units (du) permitted in a PUD in areas
of the City designated as RE-1, R-1, and R-2 shall be based on the following
maximum dwelling unit per acre density by proposed zoning district:
Zoning District Maximum Density
Zoning District Maximum Density
RE-1            1.0 du/ac
R-1(100)        2.0 du/ac

175B.21   OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
In addition to the zoning districts listed and their associated regulations set
forth in Chapter 175B, additional regulations and requirements are imposed upon
certain areas of the City of Norwalk in which the City desires to protect life
and property from losses, hazards and related affects caused by the occupancy
and use of flood hazard areas by buildings, structures, or activities which may
increase the affects of flooding, and to prevent the creation or establishment
of airport hazards and mitigate the impact of airport-generated noise on noise-
sensitive land uses. The boundaries of the Overlay Zoning Districts are also
indicated upon the Official Zoning Map of the city, which is made part of this
ordinance by reference. If the regulations and restrictions for the Overlay
Zoning Districts set forth in this chapter impose greater standards or more
restrictive requirements than are required in any other chapter or section of
this Ordinance, or other local, State or federal regulation, the regulations or
requirements made under this chapter shall prevail and govern. In order to
carry out the purpose and intent of this chapter, the following seven (7)
Overlay Zoning Districts are established:
FW   Floodway Overlay Zoning District
FF   Floodway Fringe Overlay Zoning District
FP   General Flood Plain Overlay Zoning District
AZ   Approach Zone Overlay Zoning District
CZ   Conical Zone Overlay Zoning District
HZ   Horizontal Zone Overlay Zoning District
TZ   Transitional Zone Overlay Zoning District
175B.22   FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS.
This section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of
Norwalk shown on the Official Zoning Map as shown as being within the
boundaries of the FW Floodway, FF Floodway Fringe, and FP General Floodplain
and provisions of Sections
175C.01,
175C.02, and
175C.03.
   1.   Statement of Intent. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing flood losses and
secure safety from flooding and to provide the following:
      A.   Reserve sufficient flood hazard areas for the conveyance of flood
flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   2.   Statutory Authorization and Findings of Fact.
      A.   Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in
Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, delegated the responsibility to cities to enact
zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and
general welfare.
      B.   Findings of Fact.
         1.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Norwalk are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life, property, and health;
safety hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extra-
ordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; and impairment of
the tax base; all of which adversely affect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the community.
         2.   These losses, hazards, and related effects are caused by: (i) the
occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which
create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flood; and (ii) the cumulative effect of flood plain
construction on flood flows, which causes increases in flood heights and flood
water velocities.
         3.   This section relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources.
   3.   General Provisions.
      A.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of
the district shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning
Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries
of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the Zoning Administrator
shall make the necessary interpretation with the use of available topographic
information and projected flood elevations. The person contesting the location
of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present
their case and submit technical evidence to the Zoning Administrator subject to
the right of appeal to the Norwalk Board of Adjustment.
      B.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Warren County and incorporated areas, City of Norwalk,
Panels 1918C0039G, 0043G, 0044G, 0126G, 0127G, 0129G, 0132G, 0133G, dated
November 16, 2018, which were prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for
Warren County, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. The flood profiles and all explanatory material
contained with the Flood Insurance Study are also declared to be a part of this
ordinance.
(Ord. 18-20 – May 19 Supp.)
      C.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
      D.   Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. The provisions of this Ordinance
shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Norwalk shown
on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the
Floodway, Floodway Fringe, and General Floodplain (Overlay) Districts, as
established in Section
175B.22.
      E.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
      F.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State
statutes.
      G.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The City, by adoption of this
ordinance, does not warrant or imply to the public or any individual that
compliance with this chapter will protect the public or any individual from
injury, property damage, or death as result of flood, flood heights, or a
consequence of water velocity or intensity accompanying any flooding. This
section does not create any cause of action, right, or entitlement in the
public generally or any individual whether that individual is a person, firm,
corporation, or other entity. Neither the City of Norwalk nor any of its
officers, officials, or employees shall have any liability to anyone for any
claim, injury, property damage, death, or any claim connected therewith based
upon any provisions of this section.
(Ord. 24-10 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
   4.   Administration of Flood Hazard Area Overlay Zoning District
Regulations.
      A.   Duties and Responsibilities of Zoning Administrator Concerning Flood
Hazard Area Overlay Zoning Districts.
         (1)   Duties and responsibilities of the Zoning Administrator shall
include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

(Ord. 24-10 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
      B.   Flood Plain Development Permit.
         (1)   Permit Required. A Flood Plain Development Permit issued by the
Zoning Administrator shall be secured prior to initiation of any flood plain
development (any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, filling,
grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations) including the placement of
factory-built homes.
         (2)   Application for Permit. Application for a Flood Plain
Development Permit shall be made on forms supplied by the Zoning Administrator
and shall include the following information:
            a.   Description of the work to be covered by the permit for which
application is to be made.
            b.   Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be
done (i.e., lot, block, tract, street address, or similar legal description)
that will readily identify and locate the work to be done.

of improvements and market value of the structure prior to the improvements.
            g.   Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably
necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 24-10 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
         (3)   Action for Permit Application. The Zoning Administrator shall,
within a reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed flood
plain development meets the applicable provisions and standards of this chapter
and shall approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals the applicant
shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefore and shall have
the right to appeal to the Norwalk Board of Adjustment. The Zoning
Administrator shall not issue permits for uses or variances except as directed
by the Norwalk Board of Adjustment.
         (4)   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plan.
Flood Plain Development Permits issued on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and shall be
punishable as provided in this Code of Ordinances. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by professional engineer or land surveyor, as
appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that finished fill, building
floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and the plans
submitted for variance or Zoning Administrator’s approval, prior to the
building permit, use or occupancy of any structure or land.
      C.   Board of Adjustment Variances. The Norwalk Board of Adjustment may
authorize upon request in specific cases such variance from the terms of this
chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to
special conditions a literal enforcement of this chapter will result in
exceptional hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable
standards:
         (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration
of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
(Ord. 24-10 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
         (2)   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights;
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create
nuisances; or cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
         (3)   Variance shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford
relief.
         (4)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
(Ord. 24-10 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
         (5)   All variances approved by the Norwalk Board of Adjustment shall
be submitted for approval to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for
approval and such approval of the variance by the Norwalk Board of Adjustment
shall not be valid until State approval is obtained.
         (6)   After the Norwalk Board of Adjustment has granted approval of a
variance, the applicant shall have one (1) year in which to initiate and file
for approval with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
         (7)   After approval by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources of
the variance, the applicant must implement the development variance within one
(1) year of the variance or the approval of the Norwalk Board of Adjustment is
null and void and has no further force and effect.
      D.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for special uses or requests for variances, the Board
shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this
ordinance:
         (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
         (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
         (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and    unsanitary
conditions.
         (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (6)   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
         (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
         (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
         (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for the area.
         (10)   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
         (12)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
      E.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of special
uses or variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter.
Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
         (1)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
         (2)   Limitation on periods of use and operation.
         (3)   Imposition of operation controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
         (4)   Requirements for construction of channel modification, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purposes of this chapter.
         (5)   Flood proofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities,
durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors
associated with the regulatory flood. The Norwalk Board of Adjustment shall
require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered
professional engineer that the flood proofing measures are consistent with the
regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the
particular area.
         (6)   Flood proofing measures may include, but are not necessarily
limited to the following:
            a.   Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement.
            b.   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters, or
similar methods of construction.
            c.   Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures.
            d.   Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of
water through walls.

            f.   Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures.
            g.   Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems so as
to prevent the entrance of flood waters.
            h.   Pumping facilities or comparable practices for subsurface
drainage systems for building to relieve external foundation wall and basement
flood pressures.
            i.   Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water
pressure or floating debris.
            j.   Installation of valves or controls or sanitary and storm
drains which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage
and storm waters into the buildings or structures.
            k.   Location of all electrical equipment, circuits and installed
electrical appliances in a manner which will assure they are not subject to
flooding.
175B.23 INFILL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
The regulations set forth in this section or elsewhere in this ordinance which
are applicable, shall apply in the Infill Planned Unit Development (IPUD)
District.
   1.   Statement of Intent. The IPUD District is intended as an alternate
redevelopment tool for smaller developments that propose a creative and
innovative plan whose layout is not achievable by the standards under which the
property is currently zoned. The UPUD District is to provide for the
redevelopment of land under the control and in accordance with a Master Plan
and development guidelines and standards in which the land uses, transportation
elements, building densities, arrangements, and types are set out in a unified
plan, which may provide greater flexibility of land use, bulk regulations, and
building locations than the conventional zoning district may permit. The IPUD
District is intended to: maximize aesthetics; encourage certain architectural
standards for buildings; enable calculated infill development; permit mixed
uses and diversity of bulk regulations without endangering the health, safety,
welfare, and land value of surrounding and internal properties. An IPUD should
consist of no more than two different land uses, but may include a combination
of residential, commercial, and limited industrial, provided such Infill
Planned Unit Development is compatible with the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
In general, an IPUD should not deviate substantially from the current zoning of
a property and should only be used in the redevelopment of older properties
that cannot easily conform to current zoning standards.
   2.   Maximum Size, Land Use and Maximum Density. An IPUD shall consist of at
most ten (10) acres, a maximum of two land use types compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan of the City, and the density of the PUD shall not be in
excess of the density permitted by this section and compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan. An IPUD may include multiple-family or two-family dwellings
in areas designated as Low Density Residential in the Comprehensive Plan, if
the proposed land use is compatible with land uses adjoining and outside the
PUD, and the dwelling unit density of the IPUD is not greater than fifty
percent (50%) greater than the maximum density permitted by the underlying
zoning as set forth in this sub-section.
   3.   Master Plan. As part of a proposed Infill Planned Unit Development
rezoning of land in the City of Norwalk, a Master Plan shall be included on the
Preliminary Plat or Site Plan for the development area which shows the
generalized overall land use plan for development of the proposed IPUD and
shall include the following information:
      A.   A vicinity map of sufficient scale to show site boundaries and the
zoning of adjacent properties within 1,000 feet.
      B.   Dimensions, easements, legal descriptions, acreage, existing zoning,
land use, and ownership of the area of the proposed IPUD; and existing zoning,
land use, and ownership of contiguous properties within two hundred (200) feet.
The Master Plan shall be submitted on paper sheets of 24 inches by 36 inches.
      C.   The location and delineation of each parcel proposed with different
land uses and bulk regulations, and a schedule of the proposed land use and
bulk regulations for each parcel set forth by ordinance.
      D.   Existing and proposed location of streets, pedestrian ways, trails,
parks, recreation areas, open space, buffers, parking areas, schools, and
anticipated traffic generation.
      E.   Area and number of dwelling units, and anticipated floor area of
nonresidential buildings by parcel.
      F.   Existing tree masses, water channels, drainageways, flood hazard
areas, and other topographic or environmentally important characteristics.
      G.   Proposed privately owned common areas and public ownership areas,
including open space, park land, and school sites.
      H.   Location of existing or proposed municipal utilities and easements
to serve the IPUD and adjoining properties, including sanitary sewer, storm
sewer and water.
      I.   In addition to storm sewer facilities, other required storm water
management facilities and requirements shall be shown and/or explained on the
Master Plan.
      J.   Dimensions of all street right-of-way and paving widths, including
all proposed easements.
      K.   Landscape areas proposed as part of small-scale IPUD proposals to
include general location of shrubs, trees and earth berms.
      L.   Delineate the traffic impacts that would result from the project and
how they can be mitigated.
   4.   Rules, Regulations and Guidelines for Land Use and Performance. In
conjunction with the submittal of Master Plan illustrating the location of each
development parcel, there shall be prepared rules, regulations and guidelines
for the development of the IPUD, and such matters shall be part of the
consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council and
incorporated within an ordinance providing for the rezoning of the property to
a IPUD. The rules, regulations and guidelines shall set forth the permitted
land use, bulk regulations, height rules, regulations and guidelines shall set
forth the permitted land use, bulk regulations, height requirements, open space
and landscaping requirements, architectural standards, sign regulations, buffer
requirements, off street parking and loading requirements, and other
performance standards as required by the City for each parcel designated within
the Master Plan. Any rules, regulations and guidelines set forth within the
ordinance and Master Plan approved by the City Council providing for the
rezoning shall be binding on the property owner, their heirs, successors or
assigns, and shall be recorded at the Office of the County Recorder. It is
understood that redevelopment parcels will have contributed to a parkland
dedication in the past. Such parcels being redeveloped as an IPUD will be
exempt from requiring further parkland dedication.
   5.   Process for City Review of Infill Planned Unit Development. The Zoning
Administrator shall review the submitted IPUD proposal; may discuss any
suggestions or provide additional information to the developer, and shall file
a report together with the applicant’s proposal to the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
      A.   The Planning and Zoning Commission, after receipt of the report from
the Zoning Administrator, or other delegated City personnel, and receipt of the
IPUD proposal, shall consider the presentation and give special attention to
the following:
         (1)   Compatibility with Comprehensive Plan.
         (2)   Land use and density.
         (3)   Building types, functions, architecture, buffers and
arrangement.
         (4)   Provision and use of open space and landscaping.
         (5)   Access to and from the site, and traffic circulation.
         (6)   Appropriateness and general fit to surrounding area.
      B.   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend approval or denial
of the IPUD Master Plan and associated development rules, regulations and
guidelines as submitted, or may require the developer to modify, alter, adjust
or amend the proposed Master Plan and associated rules, regulations and
guidelines, as the Commission deems necessary, in order to preserve the
harmonious intent and purpose of this ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan of
the City.
      C.   An application for approval of IPUD shall be deemed a petition for
rezoning to the PUD Zoning District, but prior to an affirmative report from
the Commission the applicant shall file the necessary petition as prescribed in
Amendments, Section 175A.19.
      D.   Before any report is forwarded to the City Council by the Planning
and Zoning Commission pertaining to an application submitted for an IPUD, said
Commission shall determine if such proposal is compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan or if such proposal represents a substantial change to the
Comprehensive Plan. The Commission shall hold a public hearing, giving notice
as provided by law for a rezoning.
      E.   After a complete review by the Planning and Zoning Commission, a
written recommendation and report giving reasons as to their action shall be
filed with the City Council.
      F.   Within a period of sixty (60) days after the City Council has
received a report from the Planning and Zoning Commission, together with the
proposed Master Plan, and rules, regulations, and guidelines of the IPUD
development, a public hearing shall be held by the City Council in accordance
with the provisions of Section
175A.19. The City Council shall then approve or deny the application, in
accordance with Section
175A.19.
   6.   Recording of Master Plan and Associated Rules, Regulations and
Guidelines. The ordinance providing for the rezoning of property to the IPUD
Zoning District and the associated Master Plan, rules, regulations, and
guidelines as approved by the City Council shall be recorded at the Office of
the County Recorder and shall be binding on the property owners, their heirs,
successors or assigns.
   7.   Modifications. Any proposed modifications in the approved IPUD shall
first be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Said proposed
modification along with a report from the Commission shall then be forwarded to
the City Council with appropriate recommendations. The City Council shall then
take such appropriate action on the proposed modification and their decision
shall be final. No modification may be considered that is more than a twenty
percent (20%) increase in density or change of uses on the site without a
public hearing as required of a rezoning procedure. A public hearing may be
required before the City Council on any modification, if determined by the
Council. All modifications and adjustments shall be recorded at the Office of
the County Recorder as required of the original rezoning.

(Ord. 24-10 – Dec 24 Supp.)
175C.02   FF OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
The regulations set forth in this section or elsewhere in this ordinance which
are applicable, shall apply in the FF Floodway Fringe Overlay Zoning District.
   1.   Principal Permitted Uses: All development within the Floodway Fringe
District shall be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any
other ordinance (or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet
applicable performance standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
   2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may
increase the Base Flood Elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
      A.   No development within the Floodway Fringe Overlay Zoning District
shall increase the flood heights or flood profile.
      B.   All development shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   Non-residential structures - All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.
When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
      D.   Residential structures - All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0
ft. above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing
topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such
cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as
withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding.
   All new residential structures located in areas that would become isolated
due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access
that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this
criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567- 75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
      E.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures. Fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor (not including basement) that are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for
meeting this requirement must be certified by a registered professional
engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
         (4)   All such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, and low damage potential storage.
      F.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      G.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation.
      H.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non- residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
         (1)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system

175C.04   AIRPORT HAZARD, HEIGHT AND NOISE MITIGATION OVERLAY.
The regulations set forth in this section or elsewhere in this ordinance which
are applicable shall apply in the AZ Approach Zone, CZ Conical Zone, HZ
Horizontal Zone, and TZ Transitional Zone Overlay Zoning Districts.
   1.   Statement of Intent. The Airport Hazard, Height, and Noise Mitigation
Overlay Zoning Regulations are intended to prevent the creation or
establishment of hazards which may affect the safe operations of the Des Moines
International Airport, and to mitigate the effect of noise generated by the
approach and departure of aircraft from the Airport upon incompatible noise-
sensitive land uses.
   2.   Airport Zones and Airspace Height Limitations. In order to carry out
the provisions of this subsection, there are hereby created and established
certain zones, the boundaries of which are depicted as surfaces on the Des
Moines International Airport’s Airport Layout Plan (ALP) which is currently on
file at the Office of the Norwalk City Clerk and at the City of Des Moines
Engineering Department under Plan File No. 335-111/113. A structure or tree
located in more than one (1) zone of the following zones shall comply with the
regulations of the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The
various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      A.   Approach Zone. The land lying under the Approach Surface, a surface
longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward
and upward from each end of the primary surface. (Note: An Approach Surface is
applied to each end of each runway based upon the types of approach available
or planned for that runway end.)
         (1)   The inner edge of the Approach Surface is the same width as the
primary surface, and it expands uniformly to a width of:
 
Non-Precision Instrument Runway (1) 4,000 feet for Runway 23
Precision Instrument Runway     (2) 16,000 feet for all other runways
         (2)   The Approach Surface extends for a horizontal distance of:
 
Non-Precision Instrument Runway (1) 10,000 feet at a slope of 34 to 1 for
                                Runway 23
Precision Instrument Runway     (2) 10,000 feet at a slope of 50 to 1, and then
                                40,000 feet at a slope of 40 to 1.
 
No structure or tree shall exceed the Approach Surface to any runway, as
depicted on the Des Moines International Airport ALP.
      B.   Conical Zone. The land lying under the Conical Surface, a surface
extending outward and upward from the periphery of the Horizontal Surface at a
slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. No structure or tree
shall exceed the Conical Surface in the Conical Zone, as depicted on the Des
Moines International Airport ALP.
      C.   Horizontal Zone. The land lying under the Horizontal Surface, a
plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which
is constructed by: swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the State Plane
Coordinates at center of each end of the primary surface of all runways and
connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those areas.
      D.   Transitional Zone. The land lying under the Transitional Surfaces.
These surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway
centerline and centerline extended from the sides of the primary surface and
from the sides of the approach surfaces at a slope of 7 to 1 until said
surfaces intersect the Horizontal or Conical Surfaces. Beyond the limits of the
conical surface on all runway approaches except Runway 23 the Transitional
Surfaces shall extend outward and upward at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of
the Approach Surface for a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from
the edge of the Approach Surface and at right angles to the runway centerline
extended. No structure or tree shall exceed the Transitional Surface, as
depicted on the Des Moines International Airport ALP.
No structure shall be erected or tree allowed to grow in the City of Norwalk
that raises the published Minimum Descent Altitude or Decision Height for an
instrument approach to any runway, nor shall any structure be erected or tree
allowed to grow that causes the Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude or
Minimum En route Altitude to be increased on any Federal Airway in the City of
Norwalk
   3.   Noise Attenuation. Any residential dwelling, hotel, motel, group
quarters, school, hospital, auditorium, place of worship, or other place of
public assembly proposed to be constructed within the Approach Zone and within
areas of more than 65 dBA, as set forth as the area of noise attenuation on the
attached map identified as Exhibit A, shall be constructed with soundproofing
to achieve a noise level reduction of 25 dBA (outdoor and indoor). Construction
standards to achieve this degree of sound attenuation are provided in the City
of Norwalk Building Code. The development of land located within the first
10,000 feet of the Approach Zone, set forth in the map identified as Exhibit A,
shall require the submission of a "Noise and Avigation Easement" to the City by
the landowner as part of the City subdivision process and prior to initiation
of building construction.
(Ord. 23-09 - Dec. 23 Supp.)
   4.   Use Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of Subsection 2
of this section, no use may be made of land or water within the zones defined
in Subsection 2 in such manner as to interfere with the operation of any
airborne aircraft. The following special requirements shall apply to each
permitted use.
      A.   All lights or illumination used in conjunction with street, parking,
signs or use of land and structures shall be arranged and operated in such a
manner that it is not misleading or dangerous to aircraft operating from the
airport or in the vicinity thereof.
      B.   No operations from any use shall produce smoke, glare, or other
visual hazards which are sufficient to endanger aircraft operating from the
airport or in the vicinity thereof. When the Aviation Director believes such a
hazard may exist, a determination shall be obtained from the FAA as to the
existence of such a hazard.
      C.   No operations from any use shall produce electronic interference
with navigation signals or radio communication between the airport and
aircraft.
   5.   Nonconforming Structures, Trees and Uses. No pre-existing nonconforming
structure, tree, or use shall be replaced, rebuilt, altered, allowed to grow
higher, or replanted, so as to constitute a greater airport hazard than it was
when this subchapter was adopted.
   6.   Lighting.
      A.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 4 of this section, the
owner of any structure or tree over 200 feet above ground level must install on
the structure lighting in accordance with FAA Advisory Circular 70-7460-1D and
amendments. Additionally, any structure, constructed after the effective date
of this ordinance and exceeding 949 feet above ground level, must install on
that structure high intensity white obstruction lights in accordance with
Chapter 6 of FAA Advisory Circular 7460-1D and amendments.
      B.   A property owner shall permit the Des Moines International Airport
at its own expense to install, operate, and maintain on such property markers
and lights as necessary to indicate to operators of aircraft the presence of an
airport hazard.
   7.   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or to permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his or her
property in violation of any section of this subchapter may apply to the Board
of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. No application for a
variance to the requirements of this subchapter may be considered by the Board
of Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been submitted to the
Aviation Director for his or her opinion as to the aeronautical effects of such
a variance. If the Aviation Director responds to the Board of Adjustment in
favor of the variance, or if he or she does not respond within fifteen (15)
days from receipt of the copy of the application, then the Board shall make its
decision to grant or deny the variance based upon a preponderance of the
evidence. If the Aviation Director responds in opposition to the variance
within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the copy of the application, then the
Board may grant the variance only if clear and convincing evidence outweighs
the opinion of the Aviation Director.
   8.   Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment appointed pursuant to
Section 175A.20 shall have and exercise the following powers:
      A.   To hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Administrative Agency in the enforcement of this
subsection.
      B.   To hear and decide special exemptions to the terms of this
subsection upon which such Board of Adjustment under such regulations may be
required to pass.
      C.   To hear and decide specific variances.
   9.   Judicial Review. Any persons aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by
any decision of the Board of Adjustment, in the administration of this
subsection, may appeal to a court of record as provided in Sec. 414.15, Code of
Iowa.
   10.   Administration. The Zoning Administration is hereby designated as the
administrative agency pursuant to Sec. 329.13 of the Code of Iowa, with the
duty to administer the regulations prescribed in this section. Administration
and enforcement of this section shall be in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 175A.09.
   11.   Conflicting Regulations. Where there exists a conflict between any of
the regulations or limitations prescribed in this subchapter and any other
regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect
to height of structures, or trees, the use of land, or any other matter, the
more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.

   2.   Change of Use. Any lot with a change of use upon its premise shall
provide an adequate number of parking spaces required by the new use in
accordance with the standards set forth within this chapter. For buildings
which are designed to accommodate a use permitted in the zoning district which
can create a greater demand for parking than the initial use of the property,
additional open space can be required by the City Council to accommodate
additional parking, if a change of use occurs.
   3.   Mixed Uses. For multiple use buildings and/or sites which are not
multi-tenant retail shopping centers, space for parking and storage of vehicles
shall be provided in accordance with parking requirements of each use.
   4.   Uses Not Listed Herein. In case the parking requirement of a building
or use is not specifically mentioned herein, the parking space requirements for
a use which is listed above and to which said use is similar, shall apply as
determined by the Zoning Administrator. If no similar use is listed, the
parking space requirements shall be determined based upon other available
references or qualified sources of information to adequately determine parking
demand.
   5.   Parking Area Dimensions. A parking stall reserved for the parking of
automobiles shall have a dimension of not less than nine (9) feet in stall
width and nineteen (19) feet in depth for 90º parking without front-end
overhang over an open space area, plus such additional parking bay stall aisle
width based on proven traffic engineering standards acceptable to the City of
Norwalk and conforming to the minimum standards for parking lot dimensions set
forth herein necessary to afford adequate ingress and egress. Where there is
front end overhang over an open space area, the minimum stall depth for a
parking space may be reduced two (2) feet. The following dimensions are minimum
standards for the design of a parking lot for parking stalls without an
overhang over an open space area:
Parking Lot Dimensions – Minimum Standards

      Two-Way Traffic Parking Bay Aisles and Access Roadways. All two-way
traffic parking bay aisles and access roadways shall have a minimum 24' width.
      Note: The stall depth is the distance perpendicular to the parking bay
aisle from the edge of the aisle to the most distant point of the parking
stall, and stall width is the distance between the parking stall lines measured
perpendicular to the lines.
   6.   Performance Standards. Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public
or private off-street parking area shall be developed and maintained in
accordance with the following requirements:
      A.   Setback Requirements. No part of any parking space shall be closer
than fifteen (15) feet to any established public street right-of-way or public
street easement, except as hereinafter required for the following uses and
zoned districts, and as shall be necessary to provide adequate landscaped
screening as required by Paragraph D below:
         (1)   Single family and townhouse residences. Parking on driveways for
single family and townhouse residences shall not encroach into the public
street right-of-way.
         (2)   In the PC and IC Zoning Districts: twenty (20) feet.
Greater setbacks for off-street parking lots from public street right-of-ways
may be required by the City for parking lots fronting planned arterial streets
and collector streets which are proposed to be widened in the future. No part
of any parking space shall be closer than eight (8) feet to an established
alley line or five (5) feet from an adjoining lot line, unless the parking
space adjoining a lot line is part of a common parking lot of joint usage
between adjoining lots or within the driveway of a single family residence.
Parking on driveways in all zoned districts shall not be permitted within the
public street right-of-way or across public sidewalks. Driveways and associated
off-street parking areas for single family residences shall not be located
closer than one (1) foot from an adjoining residential lot line, unless such
driveway is of joint usage by adjoining residential lot owners. Driveway
approach returns shall not extend beyond the side lot line as extended, unless
such driveway is of joint usage by the adjoining lots.
      B.   Surfacing Requirements. All off-street parking areas, loading areas,
driveways, and access roadways shall have a durable and dustless surface paved
with asphaltic or Portland cement concrete pavement in accordance with the
latest published version of the Statewide Urban Design and Specifications
(SUDAS), with the following exception:
Lots over 3 acres in size that are designated in the A-R, Agricultural Reserve
District, shall be allowed granular surface driveways and access roadways that
are designed in accordance with the latest published version of SUDAS.
The City may grant special use of other hard surface materials for off-street
parking areas, loading areas, driveways, and access roadways provided that the
materials are reviewed by City staff for durability and suitability and that
the alternative material is approved for use by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the City Council. In all zoning districts, off-street parking of
automobiles, vans, construction equipment, and any other mobile vehicles
equipped for street and highway travel shall be on an asphaltic or Portland
cement concrete paved off-street parking area as required herein and not parked
or stored within the landscaped open space area of the front yard between the
building and public street right-of-way, except however, the storage of a
recreational vehicle, a camper, and boat within the rear yard upon an unpaved
area shall be permitted. Paved driveways and any associated off-street parking
areas within the front yard of a single-family detached residence shall not
occupy greater than fifty (50) percent of the area between the building setback
line and public right-of-way, and shall not provide greater than one (1)
parking space in addition to that provided in the traveled portion of the
driveway. Driveways shall not be greater than 20 feet in width between the
public street roadway and a point on private property which is setback five (5)
feet from the street right-of-way. Driveways shall be so graded and drained to
dispose of the surface water to the street or public designated storm water
drainage easements or facilities. Parking a vehicle in violation of this
Section shall constitute a nuisance and the specific fine for violation of this
Section is contained in
Chapter 177 Rates and Fees.
(Ord. 22-30 – Dec. 22 Supp.)
      C.   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking or
loading area shall be so arranged as to divert the light away from adjoining
residential uses or premises, and away from the traveled roadway of public
streets.
      D.   Landscaping, Screening and Open Space Requirements. It is desired
that all parking areas be aesthetically improved to reduce obtrusive
characteristics which are inherent to their use. Therefore, wherever practical
and except for single family detached and townhouse style residential parking
in driveways, all new parking areas shall be screened as practical from public
street view by incorporating natural landscape and topography with the
introduction of permanent earth berming of an adequate height, and additional
landscape plantings to accomplish this desire. In any case, all parking areas
shall include landscape areas and islands within the boundaries of the paved
parking area equal to not less than five (5) percent of the total paved area.
Landscaped islands within the parking area shall have ground cover of grass
(i.e. sod), shrubs, or other acceptable plant life, unless an alternate ground
cover is specifically approved as part of the site plan review by the City.
Landscape islands within the parking area shall not be less than a minimum of
eight (8) feet in width from back of curb to back of curb, and a minimum area
of two hundred fifty (250) square feet, and no parking space shall be greater
than seventy-five (75) feet from a landscaped open space. Parking spaces shall
be separated from any adjoining roadway, except the roadway or parking bay
aisle providing direct access to the parking space, by a landscaped island or
elevated separation (i.e. sidewalk) of a minimum of nine (9) feet in width.
      E.   Off-Street Parking Access to Public Streets and Internal Traffic
Circulation. Off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed so as
to permit entrance and exit by forward movement of the vehicle for all uses,
except single-family detached or townhouse dwellings which shall be permitted
backward movement from a driveway. The backing or backward movement of vehicles
from a driveway, off-street parking or loading area onto a major thoroughfare,
including all thoroughfares designated as arterial streets or major collector
streets on the Major Streets Plan shall be strictly prohibited for all uses.
The number of ingress/egress access points to public streets from off-street
parking areas shall be approved by the City and located to limit vehicular
conflicts, provide acceptable location of driveway accesses to public streets,
preserve proper traffic safety and, as possible, not impair movement of
vehicular traffic on public streets. The permitted number of ingress/egress
driveway approaches to public streets for an off-street parking lot shall be
dependent upon the projected future average daily traffic (ADT) for the public
street. As possible, public street accesses shall be located in alignment with
driveway approaches gaining access to the same public street from property on
the opposite side of the street. The design of off-street parking and loading
facilities shall provide traffic circulation for the internal forward movement
of traffic within the parking lot, so designed, limiting any impairment of
vehicular movement on public streets, or backing of vehicles from an off-street
parking or loading area to a public street. Single-family residential lots
shall be permitted one (1) driveway approach for ingress and egress for each
increment of one hundred (100) feet of frontage per street. Landscaped
separations between ingress and egress lanes for driveway approaches serving
single-family detached residences shall not be less than twenty (20) feet.
      F.   Handicap Accessible Parking Requirements. Provision of handicapped
parking spaces within off-street parking areas shall be in accordance with
applicable federal, state and local regulations, properly identified with
signage and provided with accessible ramps and walks in accordance with federal
and state regulations and comply with the following parking space minimum
requirements:
Total Parking in Lot Required Minimum Number of Handicap Spaces
Total Parking in Lot Required Minimum Number of Handicap Spaces
1 to 25              1
26 to 50             2

501 to 1,000         2 percent of total
1,001 and over       20 plus 1 for each 100 spots over 1,000
 
Access space or aisle adjacent to a handicap accessible parking space shall be
a minimum five (5) feet wide. One in every eight handicap accessible spaces,
but not less than one shall be served by an access space or aisle eight (8)
feet wide minimum and shall be designated “van accessible.”
      G.   Satellite Parking Areas. Satellite parking areas shall not be
permitted except by special use permit.
175E.05   WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS.
The City Council reserves the right to waive or modify to a lesser requirement
any provision or requirement of off-street parking and loading areas contained
in this chapter, provided a recommendation on such change is submitted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, and further provided said waiver or
modification does not adversely affect the intent of these regulations to
adequately safeguard the general public and surrounding property. Exceptions
will only be considered for those uses where special circumstances warrant a
change and whereby the modification or waiver is determined to be in the best
interest of the general public.

175F.01   APPLICATION.
The requirements set forth in this chapter shall apply to any development or
redevelopment of property within the City of Norwalk.
175F.02   STATEMENT OF INTENT.
The use of physical barriers or buffers is considered a necessary requirement
to allow for the transition from one zoning district or use to another
contrasting zoning district or use in recognition of neighbor’s rights, to
promote the coordination of neighborhood efforts and compatibility of
neighborhood elements, and to protect the value of buildings and property.
175F.03   CONDITIONS FOR REQUIRING A BUFFER.
The following conditions shall require a buffer:
   1.   Buffers shall be required as shown on the Table of Buffer Requirements
where different zoning classifications abut. A buffer required by the table
shall be provided by the proposed development when it is located in a zoning
district listed in the left-most column of the table and the development abuts
a zoning district listed across the top of the table
   2.   Where a proposed development is located adjacent to a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) District, a buffer shall be required based on the existing
uses in the area adjacent to the proposed development or the most intense uses
permitted by the PUD District if the area adjacent to the proposed development
is vacant. The buffer required shall be based on the Table of Buffer
Requirements using the zoning district in which the existing or proposed uses
permitted in the PUD District are first permitted.
175F.04   BUFFER STANDARDS.
Buffer standards are stated in terms of the width of the buffer and the number
of plant units required per one hundred (100) linear feet. The width of each
buffer shall, at a minimum, meet the standard buffer width. The City Council,
with recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, may allow the
described narrower buffer widths. The “plant unit multiplier” is a factor by
which the basic number of plant materials required for a given buffer is
determined given a change in width of that yard. The number of plant materials
required shall be rounded up when a fraction is calculated. The type and
quantity of plant materials required by each buffer, and each buffer option,
are specified in this section. These standards are minimum requirements. More
plantings, wider buffers, or higher structures may be provided.
   1.   Buffer 1: The standard buffer shall be a thirty (30) foot wide
landscaped buffer. A three (3) foot berm is required.
      Required planting per 100 linear feet of buffer:

175F.06   BUFFER WALL STANDARDS.
A buffer wall may be permitted with specific approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council, when it can be shown that a traditional
landscaped buffer is not feasible. A buffer wall shall be a minimum of six (6)
feet in height; constructed of a permanent low maintenance material such as
concrete block, cinder block, brick, concrete, precast concrete, tile block,
etc.; the wall shall be designed by an architect or engineer for both
structural adequacy and aesthetic quality.
175F.07   BURDEN OF PROVISION OF BUFFER.
The burden of provision and selection of the buffer shall be as follows:
   1.   Where two different zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them,
are both in an existing improved condition, the above requirement is not
retroactive and should a buffer be desired, it shall be by mutual agreement
between property owners or as otherwise provided by law. However, in the event
of any or all of the improved property is abandoned, destroyed, demolished,
etc., for the purpose of renewal or redevelopment, etc., that portion of such
property being renewed or redeveloped, etc., shall be considered vacant land
subject to the requirements herein.
   2.   Where one of two different zoning districts requiring a buffer between
them is partially developed, the developer of the vacant land shall assume the
burden, unless otherwise specified herein.
   3.   Where both zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them, are
vacant or undeveloped, the burden shall be assumed by the developer of the more
intense use.
175F.08   REDUCTION OF BUFFER REQUIREMENTS.
Where the line between two districts, requiring a buffer, follows a street,
right-of-way, railroad, stream, or other similar barrier, the required buffer
width may be reduced, according to the buffer standards tables, with the
exception that a buffer wall will still require City approval.
175F.09   WAIVER OF BUFFER REQUIREMENTS.
Where the line between two districts, requiring a buffer, follows a street,
right-of-way, railroad, stream, or other similar barrier, the requirement for a
buffer may be waived by the City Council upon receipt of a recommendation from
the Planning and Zoning Commission, provided such waiver does not permit the
exposure of undesirable characteristics of land use to the adjoining zoning
district.

ZONING ORDINANCE
ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS
 
175G.01 Application         175G.03 Architectural Performance Standards by
                            Zoning District and Use
175G.02 Statement of Intent
 
175G.01   APPLICATION.
The requirements, guidelines, and standards set forth in this chapter shall
apply to any development or redevelopment of property within the zoning
districts listed and within the City of Norwalk. Single-family and two-family
dwellings are exempted from this chapter, except that all single-family and
two-family dwellings, including manufactured homes and factory-built homes, and
accessory structures including detached garages and sheds over 120 square feet
in size, shall be residential in character and must incorporate Class 1, Class
2, Class 3, or Class 4 materials on 100% of their façade area.
175G.02   STATEMENT OF INTENT.
In the interest of promoting the general welfare of the community and to
protect the value of buildings and property, the image and character of a
community is considered important. It is recognized that the community should
be visually attractive as well as economically prosperous and the manner in
which a use is accomplished is as important as the use itself. It is the intent
of these architectural standards to establish basic parameters for building
design that when followed have the effect of producing structures that preserve
and enhance building and property values, are long-lasting, resistant to
deterioration, and maintain their visual appeal over time. It is further the
intent of these standards to establish and promote a community image of
permanence, quality, authenticity, and consistency through building design. It
is not the intent of these standards to unduly restrict design freedom or apply
a particular architectural style to all structures.
175G.03   ARCHITECTURAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS BY ZONING DISTRICT AND USE.

to ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by the City
and others wishing to utilize wireless communication technologies and in order
to protect public and private investments, ensure the health, safety and
welfare of the population, to provide for the regulation and administration of
the orderly location of antenna arrays and towers and to secure the rights of
the City to a return on its investment on public property.
175K.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Antenna height” means the vertical distance measured from the base of
the antenna support structure at grade to the highest point of the structure.
If the support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average between the
highest and lowest grades of the cell site shall be used in calculating the
antenna height.
   2.   “Antenna support structure” means any tower or any other structure
which supports a device used in the transmitting or receiving telecommunication
signals.
   3.   “Cell site” means a tract or parcel of land that contains the wireless
communication antenna, its support structure, accessory building(s), and
parking, and may include other uses associated with and necessary for wireless
communication transmission.
   4.   “Communications tower” means a tower, pole, or similar structure which
supports a telecommunications antenna operated for commercial purposes above
ground in a fixed location, free standing, guyed or on a building.
   5.   “Existing utility pole” means, for the purpose of citing a small cell
facility, a pole existing on or before July 1, 2017.
   6.   “Telecommunications” means the transmission, between or among points
specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in
the form or content of the information as sent and received.

      B.   It is determined by the Public Works Director that there is
sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to accommodate the
applicant’s facility.
      C.   It is determined that the presence of the facility will not increase
the water tower(s) maintenance cost to the City.
      D.   It is determined that the presence of the facility will not be
harmful to the health or safety of the workers maintaining the water tower(s).
   2.   All Other Existing Structure Sites Other than Water Tower Sites. Any
communications facilities located on the roof of an antenna support structure
must be set back at least one foot from the edge of the roof of the structure.
This setback requirement shall not apply to: (i) communications facilities
located above the roof of the structure if the facilities are appropriately
screened from view through the use of panels, walls, fences or other screening
techniques approved by the City; or (ii) camouflage antennas that are mounted

whether it is a major plat, minor plat or a replat:
         (1)   To divide a single interest in a parcel of land or other
corporal real property into two or more interests, including declarations and
establishments of horizontal property regimes and cooperative housing. For the
purpose of making such determination, a conveyance of one or more parcels to
the city or other public entity for use as right­ of-way shall not be counted
as one of said three interests; or
         (2)   To create a new street, whether by choice or by necessity in
order to comply with minimum frontage or other code requirements, and
regardless of whether the street is to be dedicated for public ownership and
maintenance, or held in common private ownership and use.
      B.   Minor Plat of Subdivision. A subdivision that divides a single
parcel of land or other interest in corporal real property into not more than
four (4) parcels or interest that each front onto an existing, paved public
street(s) may be classified as a minor subdivision. The Community Development
Director shall have the authority to classify a subdivision as a minor
subdivision provided said subdivision:
         (1)   Does not require any new public streets for access to any lot or
parcel;
         (2)   Does not require extension of public sanitary sewer, storm
sewer, or water mains; and

horizontal property regimes, and cooperatives may be filed for concurrent
review and approval.
   2.   Plat of Survey. A subdivision that divides a single parcel of land or
other interest in corporal real property into not more than two parcels or
interests; a plat that combines several parcels into a single parcel to clarify

one or more parcels of land that have metes and bounds descriptions and that
does not create any subdivision, may be done by plat of survey if approved by
the Community Development Director. Consecutive plats of survey on a single
tract of land shall not be used to circumvent the requirement for a plat of
subdivision.
   3.   Acquisition Plat. An acquisition plat may be completed in the same
manner as a plat of survey, regardless of the number or new parcels of land or
other corporal real property that are created by the subdivision, if all of the
new parcels or interests will be held in public ownership by the city or other
governmental entity, or by other persons having the power of eminent domain for

176.05 REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   1.   Pre-Application Conference. Whenever a developer proposes a plat of
subdivision, the developer shall contact the Community Development Director to
schedule a pre­application conference. The pre-application conference shall
include the developer and representatives, representatives from the department
of community development and the engineering department, and such other city
departments that express a desire to be included in such pre-application
conferences on a regular basis, or that are deemed helpful or necessary by the
Community Development Director. The purpose of the pre-application conference
shall be to acquaint the city staff with the proposed subdivision, and to
acquaint the developer with the procedures and requirements of this code along
with issues and regulations that pertain to the subdivision. The developer
shall furnish a reasonably specific description of the property to be
subdivided at the time of requesting the pre-application conference and is
encouraged to prepare and submit a conceptual layout plan for the proposed
subdivision prior to the conference in order to facilitate the pre-application
conference.
   2.   Neighborhood Sketch Plan. If the Community Development Director
determines there is no existing master plan or neighborhood sketch plan or
other plan that fulfills the intent of this section by adequately demonstrating
how a proposed land development will be compatible with the development of
adjoining lands and the Comprehensive Plan, the developer shall submit a
neighborhood sketch plan to the Director prior to or in conjunction with the
development application for a preliminary plat. Requirements for a neighborhood
sketch plan shall be as set forth in Section
176.10 of this Chapter. The procedure for review and approval of a neighborhood
sketch plan shall be the same as for a preliminary plat specified in subsection
3.A of this section.
   3.   Plat of Subdivision.
      A.   Preliminary Plat. Following one or more pre-application conferences
as determined to be necessary by the Community Development Director or as
requested by the developer, a preliminary plat of subdivision ("preliminary
plat") shall be prepared by the developer and submitted to the Director in
accordance with this chapter. Preliminary plats shall be reviewed and presented
to the Planning and Zoning Commission in general accordance with the Submittal
and Meeting Schedule further defined in Section 176.05, paragraph 9, of this
Chapter.
         (1)   The Community Development Director shall review the preliminary
plat and shall promptly convey one copy of it to each member of the Development
Review Committee for their review and recommendations. The Committee shall
review the preliminary plat for conformance to all of the city codes,
ordinances and specifications that they customarily enforce, and for
conformance to applicable professional standards. Upon completion of their
reviews, each member of the Committee shall forward their recommendations for
action on the preliminary plat to the Director for inclusion in a consolidated,
written staff report and recommendation that is to be prepared by the Director.
The Committee may recommend that the plat be approved, approved subject to
conditions and revisions, or that the preliminary plat application be denied
for reasons that shall be set forth in the written Committee recommendation.
         (2)   The Community Development Director shall provide a copy of the
written staff report and the consolidated recommendations from the Development
Review Committee to the developer prior to providing the report and
recommendations to the Planning and Zoning Commission to afford the developer
the opportunity to make any revisions deemed necessary or appropriate prior the
preliminary plat being provided to the Commission. After consulting with the
developer, the Director shall forward the Development Application along with
the Committee report and recommendations, each as revised if applicable, to the
Commission.
         (3)   The Planning and Zoning commission shall review the Development
Application and the recommendations of the Development Review Committee and act
on the proposed preliminary plat in a timely manner, and may recommend to the
City Council that it approve, approve subject to conditions or revisions, or
deny the preliminary plat application, whether or not such recommendations are
in accordance with the recommendations of the Development Review Committee. If
the commission does not act on the preliminary plat in a timely manner, the
developer may request the City Council to consider the preliminary plat and
recommendations of the Development Review Committee without the provision of
any recommendations by the Planning and Zoning commission.
         (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may, at
their discretion, hold public hearings on a preliminary plat and may provide
notice to nearby property owners or tenants in whatever manner or amount of
time that the commission or council deems appropriate.
         (5)   Once a preliminary plat has been reviewed and acted on by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the Community Development Director shall
forward the commission's recommendations and the Development Review Committee
report and recommendations to the City Council for consideration at its next
available meeting, subject to any notifications that may be directed by the
Commission or Council and revisions to the preliminary plat to satisfy all
recommended revisions and conditions, provided the City Council desires to have
all such revisions completed to the Development Review Committee's satisfaction
prior to the Council's consideration of the preliminary plat. The City Council
may adopt the recommendations of the Development Review Committee;
recommendations of the Commission if at variance with the Committee on one or
more points; or act freely of their own volition, provided that, the Council
shall have no authority to waive any requirements of the zoning code, or of any
other city code unless provisions are expressly set out in the pertinent code
to grant the council the powers to waive or make exceptions to or from such
code.
         (6)   Upon approval by the City Council and filing of a revised
preliminary plat that satisfies all conditions of approval, the Community
Development Director shall retain a copy of the approved preliminary plat in
the city files and provide a copy to members of the Development Review
Committee and to the developer if requested.
      B.   Construction Drawings. Following approval of the preliminary plat
and during such time that the plat remains valid, the developer shall cause
detailed construction drawings of and specifications for the subdivision
improvements to be prepared by a professional civil engineer who is licensed in
the state of Iowa (herein "developer's engineer") and submitted for review and
approval by the city engineer.
         (1)   The developer's engineer shall incorporate all of the
subdivision improvements that are required by this code and other applicable
regulations, and any that may be required by the City Council as a condition of
approval of the subdivision, in the subdivision improvement plans and
specifications and shall certify said plans and specifications as being fully
compliant with this code and all other applicable regulations.
         (2)   Said plans and specifications may allow for phased construction,
provided such phasing was depicted on a valid preliminary plat. In order to
facilitate such phasing, the City Engineer may require certain improvements,
including but not limited to temporary turn-around(s) and extension of
utilities to structures set beyond pavement limits, to ensure each phase
remains each fully compliant with this code and all other applicable
regulations.
         (3)   Said plans and specifications shall be fully compliant with the
valid preliminary plat and the conceptual design of the improvements as
depicted therein. If the improvement plans and specifications deviate
substantially from the valid preliminary plat, the plans and specifications
shall be revised to conform, or the preliminary plat shall be revised and
resubmitted for review and approval by the planning and zoning commission and
city council, in full compliance with the requirements of this code.
         (4)   Any improvement that is proposed to be constructed in accordance
with special provisions that are in variance with or from the city's standard
specifications shall first be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer, or
their designated agent, as part of the full and complete set of subdivision
improvement plans and specifications, and the City Engineer may require any
such variance to be submitted for review and approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council in accordance with Section 176.14 of this
chapter.
         (5)   No improvement or development, or work preparatory thereto
except clearing, grubbing and grading, shall be done prior to the city
engineer's finding that the subdivision improvement plans and specifications
are complete and in full compliance and have been properly certified by the
developer's engineer, and are therefore approved; and that all required permits
have been issued by the city engineer and all other applicable regulatory
agencies. Grading may be commenced at developer's sole risk if the City
Engineer concurs with conceptual grading plans that have been prepared by the
developer's engineer.
         (6)   The developer shall be responsible for applying for and
obtaining approval of all required permits from federal, state, and local
governmental agencies or jurisdictions prior to commencing construction of the
subdivision improvements .
         (7)   The developer's engineer shall be solely responsible and liable
for ensuring that the subdivision improvement plans and specification are fully
compliant with the requirements of this code and all other applicable
requirements and permits. The City Engineer's approval of the subdivision
improvement plans and specifications, or concurrence with conceptual grading
plans, shall only be deemed to allow the developer to commence work on the
correlating subdivision improvements or grading, in accordance with the
approved plans and specifications and all requirements of this code. The City
Engineer's approval or concurrence shall not be found to assume, alleviate, or
relieve the developer or developer's engineer from any liability or
responsibility for said plans or grading plans and the requirement to construct
the improvements in full compliance with this code; to create any vested right
to proceed with any development or improvement that is not in full compliance
with this code by reason of oversight, error or other reason; to waive any
requirement of this code unless this code expressly allows a waiver to be made
and any said waiver is made in writing; or to in any way create or assume any
liability by or for the City or any of its employees and agents.

of the construction drawings and specifications for subdivision improvement
plans and specifications and acquisition of all required permits; and while the
preliminary plat remains valid, the developer shall cause a final subdivision
plat ("final plat") to be prepared for all of the preliminary plat or for a
phase thereof as previously identified on the valid preliminary plat, and
submitted to the Community Development Director in general accordance with the
Submittal and Meeting Schedule further defined in Section
176.05, paragraph 9, of this Chapter.

and shall promptly convey one copy of it to each member of the Development
Review Committee for their review and recommendations. The Committee shall
review the final plat for conformance to the valid preliminary plat;
conformance to the approved construction drawings and specifications; for
conformance to all of the city codes, ordinances and specifications that they
customarily enforce, and for conformance to applicable professional standards.
Upon completion of their reviews, each member of the Committee shall forward
their recommendations for action on the final to the Director for inclusion in
a consolidated, written staff report and recommendation that is to be prepared
by the Director. The Committee may recommend that the final plat be approved,
approved subject to conditions and revisions, or that the final plat
application be denied for reasons that shall be set forth in the written
Committee recommendation.
         (2)   The Community Development Director shall provide a copy of the
written staff report and the consolidated recommendations from the Development
Review Committee to the developer prior to providing the report and
recommendations to the Planning and Zoning Commission to afford the developer
the opportunity to make any revisions deemed necessary or appropriate prior the
final plat being provided to the Commission. After consulting with the
developer, the Director shall forward the Development Application along with
the Committee report and recommendations, each as revised if applicable, to the
Commission.
         (3)   The Planning and Zoning commission shall review the Development
Application and the recommendations of the Development Review Committee and act
on the proposed final plat in a timely manner, and may recommend to the City
Council that it approve, approve subject to conditions or revisions, or deny
the final plat application, whether or not such recommendations are in
accordance with the recommendations of the Development Review Committee. If the
commission does not act on the final plat in a timely manner, the developer may
request the City Council to consider the final plat and recommendations of the
Development Review Committee without the provision of any recommendations by
the Planning and Zoning commission.
         (4)   Once a final plat has been reviewed and acted on by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, the Community Development Director shall forward the
commission's recommendations and the Development Review Committee report and
recommendations to the City Council for consideration at its next available
meeting, subject to any notifications that may be directed by the Commission or
Council and revisions to the final plat to satisfy all recommended revisions
and conditions, provided the City Council desires to have all such revisions
completed to the Development Review Committee's satisfaction prior to the
Council's consideration of the preliminary plat. The City Council may adopt the
recommendations of the Development Review Committee; recommendations of the
Commission if at variance with the Committee on one or more points; or act
freely of their own volition, provided that, the Council shall have no
authority to waive any requirements of the zoning code, or of any other city
code unless provisions are expressly set out in the pertinent code to grant the
council the powers to waive or make exceptions to or from such code.
         (5)   Upon approval by the City Council and filing of a revised final

176.06 PARK AND OPEN SPACE DEDICATION.
   1.   This section shall not apply to any development application, or portion
thereof, which does not include residential development and is not zoned to
permit residential use.
   2.   The method for fulfilling the developer's obligation for dedication of
park and open space shall be determined in conjunction with the Preliminary
Plat. An agreement regarding said dedication, if required, shall be approved at
the time of Preliminary Plat approval unless otherwise directed by the
Community Development Director.
   3.   For purposes of this section, the term "Comprehensive Plan" shall be
deemed to mean the City of Norwalk's Comprehensive Plan together with its
companion document, the City of Norwalk's Comprehensive Park and Open Space
Plan, including updates and amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to
time by City Council.
   4.   Dedicate Land For Park And Recreational Purposes.
      A.   All persons making a development application shall dedicate to
public use 8.5 acres of land for park purposes for each one thousand (1,000)
people, based upon the projected population of the completed development
application as calculated in accordance with this section. Therefore, the
dedication of land for park purposes shall be equivalent to 370 square feet per
resident. Such dedication shall be prorated to the amount indicated by the
projected population to the nearest one thousand (1,000) square feet of land to
be dedicated, but in any event, no dedication of such parkland shall contain
less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of land to be dedicated for park
usage.
      B.   For purposes of this section, population in the completed area
covered by the development will be determined by multiplying the number of
housing units projected in the area covered by the development application for
each type of dwelling unit times the anticipated average number of persons per
unit as given below times the required square footage per resident. The
quantity calculated for each type of dwelling unit shall be added together and
the sum shall be the projected population for purposes of the development
application. The selected dwelling unit type shall be based on the physical
characteristics of the structure rather than on the type of ownership planned
for the dwellings.
      C.   The parkland dedication for each dwelling unit type shall be as
listed below. If any proposed dwelling unit types are not listed below, the
Community Development Director shall determine which dwelling unit type(s)
shall be used for purposes of calculating the parkland dedication for the
development.
 
Parkland Dedication Requirements
Dwelling Unit Type        Population Per Dwelling Land Dedication Per Dwelling
(As per Zoning Ordinance) Unit                    Unit
Single-Family Detached    3.00 persons            l,110 Square Feet
Single-Family Attached
(Bi-attached, duplex,     2.00 persons            740 Square Feet

Multiple Family           1.60 persons            592 Square Feet
(Apartments)
Mobile Home               1.60 persons            1,044 Square Feet
 
      D.   The city may require that all land dedicated under this section be
configured or located to optimize aggregations of land and thus may require
that the dedicated land be adjacent to the land affected by other development
applications or otherwise maximize usefulness of the land in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan. The city may place similar requirements upon
dedications under this section in order to assure useful aggregations of land
for open space.
      E.   In locations where open space has been designated on the
Comprehensive Plan, such open space may be considered as parkland in fulfilling
the parkland dedication requirement, or portion thereof. On large tracts of
land where a future neighborhood park has been designated on Comprehensive
Plan, at least five (5) acres of the required parkland dedication should be
usable for development of a neighborhood park. For purposes of this section,
land dedicated for open space purposes includes natural resource areas,
watershed areas, floodplain, wooded ravines or embankments, recreational
trails, or similar open spaces.
      F.   For purposes of this section, the water area of ponds, retention
basins, and detention basins shall not be included in determining any
dedication for park or open space purposes. Ponds, retention basins, and
detention basins may be considered as part of an approved Planned Unit
Development Master Plan, if the park concept is acceptable to the Parks
Director and City Council. Floodway areas, including streams and stream
buffers, that are contiguous to parkland may count for a maximum of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the park land dedication requirement, if the concept to
include such areas is found acceptable to the Parks Director and City Council.
      G.   The dedication of any land for park or open space purposes shall
include dedication of a corridor or point of connection from public pedestrian
access, the area of which shall be included in determining compliance with this
section. A minimum of forty (40) feet of frontage to a public street is
required for each park dedicated in accordance with this section, with the
exception of land dedicated for open space purposes which shall have a corridor
or point of connection that is at least thirty (30) feet wide to accommodate
recreational trails and at least fifty (50) feet wide where required by the
City to accommodate park access drives.
      H.   Master Agreement. If the land to be developed is part of a larger
area being developed by a single developer or by a group of developers who
enter into a single agreement with the City, the developer or developers may
enter into a written agreement with the City providing for the dedication of
the land relating to the present development in a future subdivision plat,
which land shall be dedicated for recreational facilities serving the larger
area under development by the developer or developers. The written agreement
between the City and the developer or developers shall establish the timetable
for the dedication of the land by the developer. The amount of land dedicated
and the method of dedication shall be in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
      I.   Approval of a development application shall be conditioned upon the
construction of (or providing sufficient surety for the construction of) the
following improvements in accordance with the city's design standards:
         (1)   Streets abutting any dedicated land.
         (2)   Utility services (including hookups) to the boundary of any
dedicated parkland, with the exception of open space land, including water
lines, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, drainage structures, gas lines, electric
lines, communications lines, and other such utilities as are (or will be upon
completion) available to adjacent tracts.
         (3)   Sidewalks abutting any public street including recreational
trail and shared use path connections as appropriate.
         (4)   Site grading and seeding. A minimum of 75% of the parkland area,
with the exception of areas designated as open space as per subsection 4.E, of
this section, shall be graded to accommodate active recreation. The active
recreation area shall be graded such that slopes are not less than 1.5% or
greater than 5%, except under special conditions when greater slopes are
desired to enhance recreation, such as a sledding hill, as determined by the
Park and Recreation Commission. On-site drainage patterns shall be designed and
constructed to ensure runoff is not directed across active recreation areas and
approved by the City Engineer. Active recreation areas and lawns shall have a
minimum of 4 inches of clean, lightly compacted topsoil. Seeding shall be
completed using permanent seed mixtures based on planned use of the property.
         (5)   Streetlights on public streets abutting the parkland and open
space land, with streetlights designed to illuminate park access location(s).
      J.   If land dedication under this section requires an amendment to the
Comprehensive Plan, the need for such an amendment will be reported to the Park
and Recreation Advisory Commission which shall make a recommendation to the
city council on the development application.
      K.   The required land dedication under this section shall be reduced
when the person making the development application provides perpetual public
access by permanent easement to recreational facilities, playgrounds,
unobstructed open spaces, ball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball
courts, volleyball courts, picnic shelters, recreational trails and other
similar non­duplicated recreational facilities which have been (or will be)
constructed and maintained by the applicant and are not shown on the master
parks and trails plan. There shall not be any credit for swimming pools,
clubhouses and other recreational facilities not provided in public parks or
open spaces unless such recreational facilities are specifically designated on
the Comprehensive Plan. In order to determine the credit the city shall
ascertain the fair market value of the land required to be dedicated under this
section and from such value subtract 50% of the cost of the recreational
facilities constructed by the applicant and provided under this section. The
person making the development application shall then only be required to
dedicate land equal in value to the remainder.
      L.   Property subject to public access for recreational trails or shared
use paths shown on, or proposed by the city to be shown on, the Comprehensive
Plan shall be included in the calculation of parkland dedicated under this
section .
      M.   The dedication of land for recreational trails, or shared use path
required under by this chapter shall be platted as an outlot to be owned by the
city upon final platting. If specifically approved by City Council, the
dedication may include easements to the public of land used, provided such
easement is in conformance with Section 176.08, subparagraph 16(G) of this
Chapter. The dedication of land shall be made by the applicant by provision of
a warranty deed transferring title of an outlot or outlots to the City at the
time of final approval of the plat. In the case where the parkland dedication
will be fulfilled, at least in part, by dedication of an easement, the
applicant shall provide an easement document granting right of use to the City
and the general public at the time of final approval of the plat.
   5.   Alternative Location For Dedication. As an alternative to land
dedication under subsection 4 of this section, any person filing a development
application may provide jointly with other persons for the dedication of land
in an amount at least equal to the amount required under subsection 4 of this
section, at a location which is not part of the land for which approval is
sought, provided such alternative is within the same neighborhood park district
as the land for which a development application has been made, that the
alternative jointly provided will provide for a park with a total land area of
at least five (5) acres and contiguous connective open space consistent with
the Comprehensive Plan, and that such alternative dedication of land is or has
actually been dedicated to the city and has been accepted by the city for use
in accord with the said plans.
   6.   Dedication Requirement Less Than Ten Thousand Square Feet. Where
application of the formula set forth in subsection 4 of this section results in
a dedication requirement of less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet the
person making or filing the development application may elect to dedicate ten
thousand (10,000) square feet of land or fulfill their obligation by
participating in an option provided by subsection 5 of this section, but such
alternative participation shall be based upon the actual calculation under
subsection 4 of this section and not upon the equivalent of ten thousand
(10,000) square feet of land.
   7.   Alternate Plan. Subsections 4, 5 and 6 of this section notwithstanding,
any entity required to comply with this section may present an alternate plan
that meets the purposes of this section as a means of complying herewith. It
will be the burden of the entity presenting such plan to establish that such
plan meets the purposes of this section. The Park and Recreation Advisory
Commission shall review such plan and make a recommendation to the Planning and
Zoning Commission (where Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation is
otherwise required) or, where the Planning and Zoning Commission does not
review, then to the official or board responsible for review. If the Planning
and Zoning commission or other official or board recommendation is not
required, such plan and the recommendation of the Park and Recreation Advisory
Commission shall be submitted to the City Council which shall approve or reject
such plan by resolution. Any alternate proposal must directly and
proportionately benefit the development. This subsection, however, does not
authorize the payment of impact fees to the city in lieu of the parkland
dedication requirements.
   8.   Single-Family Residential Units: This section shall not apply to any
development application containing three (3) or fewer single-family residential
units. A person making or filing a development application shall not divide
land into separate plats in order to seek a waiver under this provision. Where
a development application is made for multiple contiguous tracts within any two
(2) years, the city may treat all the development applications as one for the
purposes of this section.
   9.   Horizontal Property Regime: No declaration of a condominium regime
under Chapter 499B of the Code of Iowa, nor any conversion of an apartment to a
condominium under said Chapter shall be completed after the date of the
adoption of this ordinance unless the person or entity filing the declaration
shall have complied with the land dedication requirements of this chapter.
   10.   Severability. If any subsection or provision of this section is held
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the
validity of any other provisions of this section which can be given effect
without the invalid portion or portions and to this end each subsection and
provision of this section is severable.
   11.   Appeal Procedure.
      A.   Notice of Appeal; Fee. Any person making or filing a development
application or any person, entity, or developer affected by any decision made
by any department acting under Section 176.06, may appeal to City Council by
filing notice of appeal with the City Clerk and a filing fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) payable to the City of Norwalk to be credited to the general
fund of the city. Such appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days from the
decision of the department acting under this chapter and shall set out in
detail the reasons and grounds for the appeal. The City Clerk shall forthwith
transmit to the City Council all papers constituting the record upon which the
action appeal is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
appeal.
      B.   Public Hearing. The City Council shall upon the filing of an appeal
fix a reasonable time for a hearing, giving public notice thereof as well as
due notice to the parties in interest. All interested persons may offer oral or
written testimony at the public hearing on the appeal. A vote of three (3)
members of the City Council may affirm , modify, or reverse any decision of any
department acting under this chapter.
      C.   Park and Recreation Advisory Commission Review. Prior to the public
hearing on appeal before City Council, the Park and Recreation Advisory
Commission shall review the decision of any department acting under this
chapter and shall make a recommendation to the City Council for consideration
at the public hearing.
      D.   Appeal To The District Court. Any person, entity, or developer
aggrieved by any appeal decision of the City Council may within thirty (30)
days from the date of the City Council rendering a decision, appeal therefrom
to the district court of Warren County, Iowa, in accordance with the rules of
civil procedure .
176.07 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   1.   The developer shall install and construct all public and private
improvements required by this Chapter. All required improvements shall be
installed and constructed in accordance with the approved specifications and
under the supervision of the City Council and to its satisfaction.
   2.   All improvements required to be installed pursuant to this chapter and
the approved construction drawings shall be installed prior to the issuance of
building permits for buildings or structures lying within the plan unless the
developer signs and Agreement to Complete covering the developer's obligation
to complete all outstanding punch list items and has provided to the City
Engineer a performance bond, certified check or letter of credit to cover the
cost of completing such punch list items , provided the City Engineer
determines none of the outstanding punch list items negatively impacts the
health, safety, or welfare of builders and construction workers, future
inhabits of the subdivision, or the general public.
   3.   Plats of subdivision shall be improved by the developer to provide all
lots within the subdivision with adequate streets and access, public water
mains and fire hydrants, public sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
drainage improvements, streets, sidewalks, shared use paths recreational
trails, parks and park infrastructure, mailboxes, streetlights, street signs,
and traffic control signs, all to be designed and constructed by the developer
as subdivision improvements in full accordance with the chapter and
particularly in accordance with design standards set forth in Section
176.08.
   4.   A developer may be required to extend or expand existing off-site
public infrastructure as necessary to fully improve a proposed subdivision, or
the City Council may, at its sole discretion, require a proposed subdivision to
be delayed until such extension or expansion can be funded and constructed by
the city or other developer or governmental entity.
   5.   Developers shall provide for the perpetual maintenance of any and all
subdivision improvements that are not dedicated to the city or other
governmental entity, by establishing an owners' association or other person,
whether an individual or individuals, in a manner and form that is acceptable
to the city. Such improvements may include but are not limited to storm water
detention basins, ponds, bioswales, and infiltration basins; buffer yards,
landscaping, fencing or walls, and other screening; subdivision signs,
directional signs, traffic signs and pavement markings; and on-site lighting.
176.08 DESIGN STANDARDS
   1.   General requirements.
      A.   Subdivisions shall not endanger health, safety or general welfare of
the public or of persons residing or working on nearby properties, and shall
not impair an adequate supply of light and air to nearby properties.
      B.   Subdivisions shall be designed to locate and configure subdivision
improvements in a manner that will not unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of nearby properties. No subdivision shall be designed or improved in
a manner that impedes or appears to impede the development of nearby properties
that are within the city or the designated area of review.
      C.   Subdivisions and all subdivision improvements shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Post-Construction Storm Water Management
regulations, and all other applicable city, state, and federal regulations.
      D.   Developers shall provide for the perpetual maintenance of any and
all subdivision improvements that are not dedicated to the city or other
governmental entity, by establishing an owners' association or other person,
whether an individual or individuals, in a manner and form that is acceptable
to the city. Such improvements may include but are not limited to storm water
detention and infiltration basins; buffer yards, landscaping, fencing or walls,
and other screening; subdivision signs, directional signs, traffic signs and
pavement markings; and on-site lighting.
      E.   Every subdivision shall be designed with regard for existing and
proposed topography and drainage patterns, by blending grading for the
subdivision smoothly into the land forms on adjoining properties; considering
and providing for drainage into and through the subdivision, both existing
conditions and at full development of the drainage basin; and by controlling
runoff.
         (1)   An attempt should be made to preserve mature upland forestation
and other natural vegetation and geological features, while recognizing that
the developer is required to substantially grade and contour a subdivision to
construct the required subdivision improvements and properly grade streets,
alleys, and lots to comply with this and other city codes and regulations, and
state and federal regulations, and recognizing that the probability of post-
development survival of trees and other existing vegetation may be greatly
diminished by such necessary site modifications and disturbances
         (2)   Clear cutting shall not be permitted, particularly in areas
identified as agricultural reserve/open space or park/recreation on the
Comprehensive Plan, unless specifically approved by City Council and in
consideration of quality of species.
         (3)   Where preservation does not appear to be practical, subdivision
and development landscaping should select overstory tree species that will
create or reestablish the dominant tree species that would be native to the
environ when possible, or alternatively to create subdivision character that is
in keeping with the city as a whole, or that will uniquely identify the
subdivision.
         (4)   The timing of tree clearing operations shall be in compliance
with Iowa Department of Natural Resources regulations.
      F.   Subdivisions shall not create or perpetuate outlots that are
intended to prevent adjoining properties from having access to subdivision
improvements that are or will be dedicated to the city unless such outlot is
expressly approved by the City Council at the time of preliminary plat
approval.
      G.   Subdivisions and all subdivision improvements shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Code, and all other applicable city and state
regulations.
      H.   Standard Specifications. All design and construction shall be in
accordance with the Statewide Urban Design and Specifications program
["SUDAS"]. The term "SUDAS" shall be interpreted to include both the SUDAS
Design Manual and the SUDAS Standard Specifications, each as current at the
time the preliminary plat was approved by City Council, including any
amendments approved by the City of Norwalk. Where any conflict exists between
SUDAS and the design standards prescribed by this chapter, the requirements of
this chapter shall govern.
   2.   Site Suitability .
      A.   Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood
or other menace, and shall not be subdivided until showing can be made that
those public utilities and improvements will be provided as required by this
chapter and/or other applicable ordinances of the city, and proper provision
has been made for drainage, water, sewage, transportation facilities and other
improvements, to the greatest extent possible, attention shall be directed to
the prevention of pollution of air, water, including streams, ponds, and
subsurface water aquifer(s).
         (1)   Areas along major drainage ways and/or areas having steep or
unstable embankments shall be required to provide easements of sufficient size
to allow for slopes to be laid back at a 4:1 slope should regrading be required
in the future, unless such requirement is waived by the City Engineer.
      B.   Land which the city finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations,
adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features
which will reasonably be harmful to the health, safety and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision, surrounding areas, or
both, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are
formulated by the developer and approved by City Council, upon recommendation
of the Planning and Zoning Commission to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions .
      C.   Soil tests and geotechnical report are required in accordance with
Section
176.11, subsection l(E); to ascertain whether expansive soils or other
conditions exist that may affect the suitability and design of the subdivision
and subdivision improvements.
   3.   Blocks.
      A.   No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet, measured from street
centerline to street centerline.
      B.   At street intersections, block corners shall be rounded with a
radius of not less than 25 feet as measured at the right-of-way line. However,
the right-of-way radii at intersections involving one or more arterial street
shall require special design as consideration and approval by the City
Engineer.
   4.   Lots.
      A.   Minimum lot dimensions and size shall conform to the requirements of
the Zoning Code for the applicable zoning district.
      B.   A subdivision may establish setback lines that are greater than the
minimum requirements of the Zoning Code or other city requirements for any or
all lots. By so drawing or designating such setback lines on the plat, such
setback lines shall thereafter be the minimum setback requirements for said
lots.
      C.   Setback lines shall parallel the street right-of-way. Minimum lot
widths and frontage shall be measured parallel or radial to the right-of-way
line respectively for straight or curved segments.
      D.   Side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street right-of-way,
or radial to the street right-of-way on curved streets.
      E.   Minimum street frontage. All lots shall front onto a street and
obtain vehicular access from a street. Lots that front onto a public street
shall have the minimum street frontage required by the Zoning Code, including
lots that front on cul-de-sac turnarounds.
      F.   Corner lots. All corner lots shall have a minimum width of 20 feet
greater than the minimum lot width required by the Zoning Code in order to
permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side streets.
      G.   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage lots shall be prohibited,
except where such lots back onto a major thoroughfare or highway or in the case
of large commercial or industrial lots. Such double frontage lots shall have a
buffer adjoining the rear street frontage. The building setback shall be
measured from the boundary of landscape buffer zone.
      H.   Flag Lots. The division of land into a flag lot or lots shall
generally be discouraged by the City; and only permitted to provide access to
lots where there exists unique topography, an unusual configuration of land
ownership, adjoining developed land will not allow access from a public street,
public land or environmentally sensitive land that is planned to be left
undisturbed, or to minimize streets or public infrastructure to reduce
maintenance responsibilities. Flag lots shall be permitted only when
specifically approved by City Council.
      I.   Buffers. Buffers and improvements thereto shall be provided by the
developer in accordance with the minimum requirements of the Zoning Code, or
such additional requirements that the City Council may be stipulate as a
condition of approval of a plat. All fences, berms and buffer yard plantings
and improvements shall conform to the Zoning Code.
      J.   Lot Size where Public Services Are Not Available. For the purpose of
complying with minimum health standards, lots which cannot be reasonably served
by an off-site public or common sanitary sewer system shall have a minimum
width of 125 feet measured at the front yard setback line and an area of not
less than 40,000 square feet. Lots shall be a minimum of 10 acres where there
is proposed an on-site well for potable water and on-site sewage disposal is
proposed.
      K.   Building Envelope. Every lot, with the exception of townhome lots,
shall have at least 2,000 square feet of contiguous area, hereinafter referred
to as the "building envelope", of a shape sufficient to hold a principal
building unless otherwise approved on a Planned Unit Development Master Plan.
The building envelope shall be exclusive of setbacks, floodway, and easements
and shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
   5.   Grading.
      A.   All lots in subdivisions shall be graded to be entirely one foot or
more above the base flood elevation as determined by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) for a regulatory flood having a one percent or less
chance of occurring in any one year, or any such higher standard that may
hereafter be adopted by FEMA, and to allow basements that will be not less than
one foot above the base flood elevation of the regulatory flood to be included
in single-family detached residential and any and all other development that
customarily is constructed with basements or other low enclosed building areas,
on all lots. The developer shall cause minimum floor elevations (MFE) that are
fully compliant with city and FEMA regulations to be noted on the final plat,
or an engineer's exhibit recorded with the final plat, and the final plat shall
state that the property owner is responsible for maintaining their lot in in
perpetual compliance with said minimum floor elevations (MFE).
      B.   When a portion of a proposed lot lies less than one foot above the
base flood elevation, said area shall be designated as an unbuildable Outlot
and perpetually tied to the adjoining buildable lot by a record of lot tie
agreement that shall be recorded with the final plat.
      C.   Minimum opening elevation (MOE) requirements are intended to protect
property only from localized storm runoff, detention basins and ponds, or
shallow flooding, and shall not be allowed or construed to satisfy or comply
with FEMA requirements or city code requirements and intent to protect persons
and property from the dangers and adverse effects of flooding, regardless of
whether a LOMR-F has been obtained for a property. MOE requirements shall be
construed to apply to an entire lot and all portions of every building unless
an exception is expressly noted and approved with whatever conditions and
limitations that are deemed appropriate for any such exception, including, but
not limited to, a case where MOE protection is necessary for surface water
flowage or storm water management that is contained within a public easement on
a portion of a lot, and does not affect the entire lot. The developer shall
cause minimum opening elevations (MOE) to be noted on the final plat, or an
engineer's exhibit attached to the final plat, and the final plat shall state
that the property owner is responsible for maintaining their lot in in
perpetual compliance with said minimum opening elevations (MOE).
      D.   No cut trees, timber, debris, contaminated soil, waste concrete,
junk, rubbish, sewage, garbage, or food waste shall be buried, or left
deposited on any lot or outlot at the time the public improvements are
accepted. Debris and soil deposited on existing public streets during
construction shall be removed by the developer before the end of each work day.
   6.   Streets.
      A.   The City Engineer shall have the sole authority to establish the
municipal functional classification of a street as a major arterial, minor
arterial, collector or local street for the purposes of this Code. The
municipal functional classification may deviate from the federal functional
classification for the same street.
      B.   Connectivity and general design. Public streets in all subdivisions
shall be designed and configured to provide connectivity between adjoining
properties and subdivisions to facilitate access and circulation within
neighborhoods; to be in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and Complete
Streets Policy; and to thereby minimize and reduce traffic congestion, improve
the efficiency of providing municipal services and enhance public health,
safety and welfare together with protecting and increasing property values.
Subdivisions of large parcels shall be designed and phased accordingly, to
establish such connectivity at the earliest reasonable date.
      C.   Right-of-Way. All new street rights-of-way shall be conveyed by
warranty deed and without any conditions or limitations, in accordance with the
following:
         (1)   Major arterial street rights-of-way shall be designed to have a
total minimum right-of-way width of 120 feet, or wider if so required by the
City Engineer or City Council, and subdivisions on each side of the centerlines
thereof shall dedicate one-half of such width;
         (2)   Minor arterial street rights-of-way shall be designed to have a
total minimum right-of-way width of 100 feet, or wider if so required by the
City Engineer or City Council;
         (3)   Collector street rights-of-way for residential subdivisions
shall be designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 70 feet, and
collector street rights-of-way for nonresidential subdivisions shall be
designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 80 feet, or wider if so
required by the City Engineer or City Council.
         (4)   Local street rights-of-way for residential subdivisions shall be
designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 60 feet, and local
street rights-of-way for nonresidential subdivisions shall be designed to have
a total minimum right-of-way width of 70 feet, or wider if so required by the
City Engineer or City Council.
         (5)   Additional street rights-of-way widths may be required to be
dedicated at the intersections of streets and access points, in order to
accommodate turn lanes and sidewalks within the rights-of-way.
         (6)   Additional street rights-of-way widths may be required to
accommodate alternative of forms of transportation, including but not limited
to pedestrians and bicycles, in accordance with the City of Norwalk's Complete
Streets Policy.
         (7)   The foregoing street rights-of-way widths may be amended if
previously approved by the City of Norwalk on a Master Plan or Planned Unit
Development (PUD) plan.
      D.   Costs, responsibilities. Developers shall be fully responsible for
the following costs related to street improvements, all of which shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with SUDAS:
         (1)   The entire cost of providing and installing all collector and
local streets within a subdivision.
         (2)   A portion of the cost of improving any existing, unimproved
granular street that abuts the proposed subdivision. The developer's cost share
shall be based on a traffic study to determine the percentage of traffic that
the subdivision is expected to contribute in the future in comparison of the
total traffic anticipated on the street. Project costs to be shared shall
include P.C.C. pavement, subbase, storm sewers, grading, and engineering and
shall be based on an opinion of probable construction cost prepared by the City
Engineer for design and reconstruction of the existing street to meet city
standards.
         (3)   The entire cost for providing and installing turn lanes, street
widening, traffic signals and similar traffic and transportation improvements
based on a Traffic Impact Study if required for the subdivision in accordance
with Section
176.08, subsection 6(T).
      E.   Continuation of existing and planned streets. Subdivisions shall be
designed to provide for the continuation of existing and planned public
streets, and those in valid preliminary plats, in whatever manner is deemed
appropriate by the City Engineer. Streets shall be designed and configured to
conveniently channel local traffic onto collector and arterial streets and to
discourage through traffic, being that which does not have an origin or
destination within the subdivision or nearby area, from utilizing collector or
local streets as a means of traveling from arterial street to arterial street.
      F.   Intersections. Street intersections shall be in conformance with
SUDAS and shall be at right angles wherever possible and not less than a 70-
degree angle or shall be in conformance with SUDAS requirements if said
requirements are more restrictive. The minimum offset between street
intersections shall be in conformance with SUDAS on local and collector streets
shall be 300 feet, and the minimum on an arterial street shall be 1,200 feet.
Improvement and dedication. Streets shall be so located and designed as to be
improved and dedicated to the full rights-of-way and roadway widths as required
by this Code. No street shall be designed or accepted for half-width paving or
right­ of-way dedication unless recommended by the Director and the City
Engineer.
      G.   Limited access to arterial streets.
         (1)   Streets and other vehicular accesses shall be designed to
intersect or otherwise connect to arterial streets at points measuring not less
than a nominal minimum distance of 600 feet between full movement accesses and
of 300 feet between any access and right-turn only or other limited-movement
accesses to said arterial street; provided that access shall be in conformance
with SUDAS requirements if they are more restrictive.
         (2)   Single-family lots in plats of subdivision shall not be allowed
to have vehicular access to an arterial street, except where no other streets
are reasonably available to provide access and subject to the locations of any
such accesses being shown on the plat and approved by the City Council. Such
access restriction shall be noted on the final plat.
         (3)   Sunset Drive (IA 28) is a controlled access street to which
access is allowed only by approval of City Council and by in accordance with
joint permit as approved by the Iowa Department of Transportation (herein
"IDOT").
      H.   Turn lanes and traffic-control devices.
         (1)   Right and left turn lanes shall be provided at all points that
provide or are intended to provide access to an arterial street from existing
or proposed nonresidential or multi-family residential development, unless such
requirement is waived by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may require right
and left turn lanes to be provided for access to a collector street based on
the design of the subdivision or neighborhood and expected traffic volumes.
         (2)   The City Engineer may require traffic signalization or other
traffic control devices to be included in the subdivision improvements for any
plat of subdivision if zoned or planned for nonresidential or multi­family
development.
      I.   Shared access and alignment. Streets and other vehicular accesses
shall be designed to align with existing or proposed, approved streets and
other vehicular access points on the opposing frontage of arterial and
collector streets. Cross-access easements shall be provided, in whatever
configuration, dimension, and manner that the City Engineer deems necessary and
appropriate, to allow and facilitate the sharing of access to public streets by
multiple properties, whether the properties are within or outside of the
subdivision boundaries, in order to reduce traffic conflicts and congestion,
and improve safety.
      J.   Cul-de-sacs and Temporary Turnarounds.
         (1)   Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed a length of 600 feet as measured
from the centerline of the intersecting street to the center of the turnaround,
and shall not serve more than 30 dwelling units, unless a longer length or
larger numbers of units is approved by the City Council in accordance with
Section
176.14 of this chapter.
         (2)   Land uses generating a maximum of 300 average daily trips
("ADT") or a maximum of 30 single-family detached dwelling units will be
permitted access to a cul-de-sac street without a second means of access.
Traffic generation will be based upon trip generation in accordance with the
Institute of Traffic Engineers. Land uses exceeding said maximums shall have
secondary access unless otherwise approved by City Council in accordance with
Section
176.14 of this chapter.
         (3)   A permanent turn around shall be provided at the end of each
cul-de-sac in accordance with SUDAS, except that the cul-de-sac radii in a
residential subdivision shall be a 45 feet as measured at the back of curb of
the roadway and 59 as measured at the street right-of-way; and except that the
cul-de-sac radii in a non-residential subdivision shall be a 45 feet as
measured at the back of curb of the roadway and 59 feet as measured at the
street right-of-way. Permanent dead-end street other than cul-de-sacs are
prohibited, and no lots shall take their access from a dead-end street other
than a cul-de-sac, permanent or temporary, unless waived by City Engineer or if
driveway access is restricted. Hammerheads shall not be considered an
acceptable alternative to a cul-de-sac.
         (4)   Temporary Cul-de-sacs. Streets that are temporary dead-end
streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a cul-de-sac with radii no
less than 40 feet and of a design that is satisfactory to the City Engineer. A
gravel turnaround shall be considered acceptable if the temporary dead-end
street is part of a larger subdivision by the same developer, provided the
street is extended within two years and provided the developer maintains the
gravel turnaround in a manner that is acceptable to the City Engineer until
such time as the street is extended. Hammerheads shall not be considered an
acceptable alternative to a cul-de-sac unless specifically approved by City
Engineer for short-term applications only.
         (5)   "Eyebrow" cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac bulb used at an "L-shaped"
intersection in the street shall be discouraged, and only permitted to improve
access to lots at the "eyebrow" cul-de-sac intersection due to the unique
topography of the area, unusual configuration of land ownership, or existing
adjoining developed land will not allow access from a through street or
traditional cul-de-sac, or the existence of public land or environmentally
sensitive land that is planned to be left undisturbed. The "eyebrow cul-de-sac"
at an intersection shall be designed with dimensions, radii and curve standards
as used for cul-de-sacs with the center of the cul-de-sac bulb located at the
intersection of the street centerlines and shall have a minimum radius of 50
feet as measured at the back of curb of the roadway and 65 feet as measured at
the street right-of-way.
      K.   Secondary access required. Land uses generating a more than 300
average daily trips or more than 30 single-family detached dwelling units shall
have a secondary means of access to the lots, unless otherwise approved on a
valid preliminary plat. Traffic generation will be based on actual traffic
counts or upon trip generation in accordance with the Institute of Traffic
Engineers.
      L.   Pavement width. The width of the street or roadway shall be in
accordance with SUDAS, based on the functional classification of the roadway,
unless otherwise determined by the City Engineer or unless otherwise amended if
previously approved by the City of Norwalk on a Master Plan or Planned Unit
Development (PUD) plan.
      M.   Pavement and Subbase Material. All proposed public streets shall be
paved with Portland cement concrete (PCC) and shall have an integral 6-inch
curb and gutter, unless an alternative paving material or design is approved by
the City Council in accordance with Section 176.14 of this chapter. The
developer's engineer shall complete a pavement thickness design per SUDAS to
determine required thickness of materials, subbase requirement if any, and
other design parameters based on a 50-year life span; provided the minimum
pavement thickness for local residential streets shall be 7 inches. Pavement
thickness design shall be based on the municipal functional classification of
an equivalent street as determined by the City Engineer.
      N.   Extension to Plat Boundary . All public streets shall be extended to
the plat boundary unless otherwise specifically approved by City Council upon
recommendation by the Community Development Director. In such unique cases, the
responsibility for future extension of the public street may be addressed
though a Development Agreement approved by City Council.
      O.   Private Streets. Unless otherwise approved by City Council, private
streets serving commercial uses shall be a minimum of 24 feet wide unless the
City Engineer determines greater width is necessary due to expected traffic
volume or truck traffic. Private streets serving residential uses shall be in
conformance with Zoning Code. Pavement thickness shall be per SUDAS, based on
the functional classification of an equivalent street as determined by the City
Engineer. All public utilities shall be located outside the pavement unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer and the easement for said public
utilities specifies the City shall not be responsible for removal and/or
replacement of the street pavement should utility repair, replacement,
upsizing, or similar work be deemed necessary by the city.
      P.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named and in a
manner conforming to the City's street naming system. A proposed street that is
in alignment with other existing streets shall bear the same name. Names of new
streets shall be subject to the approval of the Council.
      Q.   Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will not be permitted.
Where there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the
property to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary
by the Council.
      R.   Alleys. Alleys may be permitted in commercial areas provided the
alley is privately owned and maintained. Alleys may be permitted in residential
areas to provide access to the rear of the lots where said lot also has
frontage on a public street. Alleys serving multiple properties shall be
maintained by a property owner(s) or property owners association. Dead­end
alleys shall be provided with a means of turning around at the end of the
alley. Public utilities shall not be located within an alley .
      S.   Driveways. Driveways for single-family residential uses shall not be
permitted to access arterial streets or, to the extent possible, collector
streets. Such access restrictions shall be noted on the final plat.
      T.   Traffic Impact Study. A Traffic Impact Study shall be required when
a proposed subdivision will generate 100 or more added (new) trips during the
adjacent roadway's peak hour or at the development's peak hour. The developer
will be responsible for completing an application for traffic analysis
including the preliminary plat or detailed concept plan; building locations,
types, quantity, and land use; all proposed access locations; and peak hour
rips in accordance with Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) standards. The
Traffic Impact Study will be completed by the City Engineer or an independent
consulting engineer designated by the City. The developer will be responsible
for the entire cost of said Traffic Impact Study, with these costs paid in full
prior to any work being commenced on the study in accordance with Section
176.13. Alternatively, if requested by the developer, the City Engineer, at
his/her sole discretion, may allow a previously conducted, relevant Traffic
Impact Study to be submitted for review to determine if a new Traffic Impact
Study is needed. The City Engineer has the authority to waive the requirement
for a Traffic Impact Study if deemed appropriate.
   7.   Water Mains.
      A.   Water mains shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter, or
larger if increased size is determined to be necessary to provide domestic and
fire flows as determined to be satisfactory and necessary by the City Engineer.
Developers shall be fully responsible for the costs of all mains that are 8
inches or less in diameter, however developers shall not be responsible for the
cost of upsizing the water main to a larger pipe unless the larger pipe is
needed to serve the developer's subdivision. The cost of the water main shall
include the pipe and bedding, together with all hydrants, valves and other
appurtenances thereto, and as may be otherwise required to be in full
accordance with the requirements of SUDAS and applicable city codes.
      B.   Water service lines shall be extended to each lot. The minimum size
for a water service line serving a single-family dwelling shall be one (1) inch
and shall terminate at a curb stop located one foot inside the right-of-way
line. Duplexes, bi-attached residences, townhomes, and condominiums shall have
a separate water service line to each dwelling unit. No lot shall have more
than one service line, whether or not in actual use, unless expressly approved
by the City Engineer.
      C.   Fire hydrants shall be provided in the number and locations required
by the City Engineer, in consultation with the Fire Department, and shall be
supplied with appropriate connections as may be specified by the Fire
Department. Fire hydrant coverage shall be in conformance with city fire code
or SUDAS, whichever is more restrictive. The Community Development Director may
approve adjustment to building setback lines on the preliminary and final plats
to ensure adequate hydrant coverage is provided to the buildable areas of the
lots.
      D.   Extension to boundary. Water mains and appurtenances thereto shall
be extended to the boundary of the plat of subdivision where necessary to
accommodate future extensions as determined by the City Engineer.
      E.   For subdivisions that cannot reasonably be served by a public water
system, a private water system shall be installed to meet city standards,
including provision of fire flows and construction observation, and an
agreement shall be executed and recorded providing for conveyance of the water
system to the city without cost upon annexation. All such private facilities
shall be restricted to personal household and agricultural uses, and shall be
subject to approval by Warren County Board of Health or to certification by an
independent professional engineer and qualified testing laboratory if not
subject to county regulation or if the county lacks the ability to perform the
necessary testing and approval of the facility's design and construction
   8.   Sanitary Sewers.
      A.   Sanitary sewers shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter, or
larger if increased size is determined to be necessary to serve the entire
service area as determined by the City Engineer. Developers shall be fully
responsible for the costs of all sanitary sewers that are 8 inches or less in
diameter, however developers shall not be responsible for the cost of upsizing
the sanitary sewer to a larger pipe unless the larger pipe is needed to serve
the developer's subdivision. The cost of the sanitary sewer shall include the
pipe and bedding, together with all structures and other appurtenances thereto,
and as may be otherwise required to be in full accordance with the requirements
of SUDAS and applicable city codes.
      B.   Sanitary sewer service lines shall be extended to each lot. The
minimum size for a sanitary sewer service line serving a single-family dwelling
shall be four (4) inches and shall terminate ten (10) feet inside the lot.
Duplexes, bi-attached, and townhomes shall have a separate sanitary sewer
service line to each dwelling unit. No lot shall have more than one service
line, whether or not in actual use, unless expressly approved by the City
Engineer.
      C.   Extension to boundary. Sanitary sewers and appurtenances thereto
shall be extended to the boundary of the plat of subdivision where necessary to
accommodate future extensions as determined by the City Engineer.
      D.   For subdivisions that cannot reasonably be served by a public
sanitary sewer system, dry sanitary sewers shall be installed to meet city
standards, and an agreement shall be executed and recorded providing for
conveyance of the sanitary sewer system to the city without cost upon
annexation. All such private facilities shall be restricted to personal
household and agricultural uses, and shall be subject to approval by Warren
County Board of Health or to certification by an independent professional
engineer and qualified testing laboratory if not subject to county regulation
or if the county lacks the ability to perform the necessary testing and
approval of the facility's design and construction.
   9.   Storm Sewers and Drainage.
      A.   Storm Water Management Plan. A storm water management plan, prepared
and certified by the developer's engineer, shall be provided for review and
approval by the City Engineer.
      B.   Developers shall be fully responsible for the cost of all storm
sewers, structures, and appurtenances thereto, drainage ways and other surface
water flows, and storm water detention facilities; all of which shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with SUDAS and applicable city codes.
Sump pump collector lines conveying no surface drainage shall be 8 inches
minimum size.
      C.   Subdrains shall be provided in the following locations:
         (1)   In all areas recommended for subdrain installation in the
geotechnical report;
         (2)   In all areas with 18-inches or more of cut measured from top of
natural grade to bottom of pavement , 6-inch longitudinal subdrain is required
on both sides of the pavement;
         (3)   In all areas where longitudinal slope of the proposed roadway
meets or exceeds 4.0 percent, 6-inch longitudinal subdrain is required on both
sides of the pavement; and
         (4)   Upon review of the overall grading plan and geotechnical report,
longitudinal subdrain may be required by the City Engineer in additional areas
where, in the City Engineer's opinion, the topography is such that there is a
need for additional subdrain in a specific area or side of the pavement.
      D.   In areas where the longitudinal slope of the proposed roadway meets
or exceeds 6.0 percent, flowable mortar cutoff walls with subdrain per SUDAS
Figure 7040.105 are required located at a spacing not to exceed 150 feet.
Lateral subdrains will be continues longitudinally along pavement to the
nearest intake or approved free outlet.
      E.   All lots that are zoned or planned for single-family residential
development shall be provided with a storm sewer service line that is capable
of collecting and conveying footing drain discharges to an appropriate outlet.
Open discharge of footing drains shall not be permitted except, if approved by
the City Engineer, if an acceptable drainage way with overland flowage easement
is available on the same lot.
      F.   Provisions for large storm events. Provisions shall be made and
maintained for surface passage of runoff from storms that exceed the design
capacity of the storm sewer system, without causing flooding or damage to
public streets or nearby properties. Surface water flowage easements shall be
provided over any and all such areas of flow that convey any off-site runoff
through a lot, of sufficient dimensions to cover the runoff resulting from a
storm having a 1% chance of occurrence in any single year, as defined by SUDAS.
      G.   Detention. Storm water detention shall be calculated and provided in
accordance with Iowa Stormwater Management Manual (ISWMM) and SUDAS Design
Manual, Chapter 2, Section 2G Detention Practices. The City Engineer shall have
discretion on which standards and practices are utilized.
         (1)   Whenever possible, storm water detention shall be accommodated
in regional basins serving multiple parcels of land rather than individual
lots; and shall be constructed as a subdivision improvement whenever possible
rather than being deferred as a future site improvement.
         (2)   When applicable as described below, all development and
redevelopment sites shall meet the requirements of the Unified Sizing Criteria,
as described within the ISWMM and as noted below, unless management has been
designated for an alternative off-site location or some other exemption or
allowance has been prior approved by the City.
            a.   Water Quality Volume Standard: To reduce potential increases
in downstream water pollution, practices or techniques shall be employed that
capture and treat runoff from a 1.25” rainfall event, as further defined within
the ISWMM.
            b.   Channel Protection Standard: As urban developments occur, some
of the largest increases in runoff rate and volume (by percentage increase)
occur during the smaller, more frequently occurring storm events. For this
reason, practices or techniques shall be employed that will provide extended
detention of the 1-year, 24-hour storm event - with release rates established
as per methods defined within the ISWMM manual to provide a minimum drawdown
period of 24 hours.
            c.   Overbank Protection Standard: To minimize surcharge of
downstream storm sewer systems and reduce the frequency of flash flooding along
urban streams and tributaries, practices and techniques shall be employed that
limit allowable peak release rates that are anticipated to occur post-
development during the 2-, 5- and 10-year, 24-hour storm events to levels no
greater than those expected to occur from natural conditions for a given site
from a similar storm event (e.g. the post-development release rate from a 5-
year storm event will be no greater than the natural release rate from a 5-year
storm event).
         (3)   Natural conditions are defined as meadow in good condition, with
times of concentrations calculated and Curve Numbers selected based on those
natural surface conditions and drainage patterns. Curve Numbers shall be
selected based on the Hydrologic Soil Group for site soils and in no case shall
the Curve Number exceed 71.
         (4)   Soil Group information shall be determined from current County
Soil maps as available through the NRCS. If a Soil Group type has not been
identified for a given location, the natural condition shall be assumed to be
Hydrologic Soil Group B and the post-developed condition shall be assumed to be
Hydrologic Soil Group C, unless geotechnical studies are provided for City
review that provide evidence for use of another Soil Group for analysis.
         (5)   Storm Water Detention shall be applicable for the following
types of projects:
            a.   New Development: Any new development of land adding more than
10,000 square feet of new impervious surface shall provide stormwater
management as outlined above. This threshold is a cumulative amount of new
square footage and may be reached over time in increments. At such time that a
development site exceeds 10,000 cumulative square feet of new impervious
surface the site will be required to come into compliance with this ordinance.
            b.   Redevelopment: Any redevelopment adding more than 10,000
square feet of new impervious surface but disturbing less than 50% of the site
shall provide stormwater management. This threshold is a cumulative amount of
new square footage and may be reached over time in increments.
Any redevelopment disturbing 50% or more of a site shall be required to meet
the same stormwater management standards as a new development. This threshold
is a cumulative amount of new square footage and may be reached over time in
increments.
            c.   City Projects: Stormwater management standards shall apply to
all City projects including new City parks, buildings, and linear projects such
as road construction projects.
            d.   Exemptions: The following activities shall be exempted from
meeting the stormwater management standards of this ordinance:
               i.   New development adding less than 10,000 square feet of new
impervious surface.
               ii.   Redevelopment adding less than 10,000 square feet of new
impervious surface and less than 50% site disturbance and if in compliance with
a previously approved stormwater management plan.
               iii.   Removal and replacement of impervious surfaces of the
same square footage within the same lot, exactly matching location and SF.
               iv.   Logging or agricultural activity that is consistent with
an approved soil conservation plan or timber management plan prepared or
approved by the appropriate agency, as applicable.
               v.   Additions or modifications to single family structures.
               vi.   Repairs to any stormwater management BMP deemed necessary
by the City.
               vii.   Any development that considered future expansion and
incorporated the anticipated impervious surface in the stormwater management
plan for the site.
               viii.   Linear projects such as road construction.
         (6)   Storm water detention basins and/or ponds shall be privately
owned and maintained unless otherwise specifically approved by City Council on
a valid preliminary plat.
         (7)   Storm water detention shall not be located within a Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated% floodplain. Storm detention
shall not be located within minimum required buffer yards or landscape setbacks
unless the detention is located within a subsurface structure of sufficient
depth below the surface to allow required landscaping to be planted and
maintained over such buried detention.
         (8)   Low flows shall be piped through detention basins whenever
possible, and a paved trickle channel shall be provided to convey the low flows
if piping is not practical, to facilitate maintenance of the basin unless the
basin is expressly designed to facilitate the absorption or infiltration of
runoff storm detention.
         (9)   The high water level, based on a 100-year storm event, shall be
noted on the preliminary plat and construction drawings. Easement area shall be
based on one foot of freeboard above said high water level. Wet-bottom
detention ponds shall have a 10-feet wide easement area around the perimeter of
the pond to allow full access for maintenance and repair purposes. All
easements shall connect to the public right-of-way.
         (10)   Staged outlet control of storm water detention basins shall be
required to ensure discharge is restricted to 2-year, pre-development release
rates for 2-year storm under developed conditions, and 5-year, pre-development
release rates for 5-year through 100-year storm under developed conditions. The
City Engineer may require that data be provided for a 1-year, 24-hour storm
event under design conditions to evaluate drawdown period for smaller, more
frequently occurring storm events. The design goal of the staged outlet should
be to release a 1-year, 24-hour storm event over a 24 hour period.
         (11)   In certain unique circumstances, the City may agree to take
ownership of a detention facility or pond. In such cases, the developer shall
sign an Agreement to Complete that obligates the developer to certify the
grinding of said facility or pond is complete at the time the subdivision is
80% developed, with the timing of said certification to be as determined by the
City Engineer. This Agreement shall specifically require the developer to
remove accumulated silt and sediment may be necessary to demonstrate the as-
built conditions correspond to the approved design in accordance with the Post-
Construction Storm Water Management regulations specified in
Chapter 166 of the municipal code of the City of Norwalk.
(Ord. 22-26 – Dec. 22 Supp.)
      H.   Lot drainage. Drainage swales shall be developed as necessary to
ensure positive drainage away from each lot; such required drainage swales
shall be preserved by an overland flowage easement. Vegetated areas shall have
a 2% minimum slope to maintain positive drainage throughout each lot and the
subdivision as a whole. Subsurface drainage shall be provided in such locations
and manner as may be required by the City Engineer, which may include but is
not limited to the rear lot lines of any or all lots.
      I.   Erosion control. Erosion control improvements shall be installed in
and along all surface drainage channels to reduce flow velocities and protect
channel bottoms and banks from scouring and cutting, and at storm sewer
outfalls and discharge points, in whatever matter and extent that the City
Engineer finds necessary to prevent channel and sheet erosion to a reasonable
extent. Such improvements may include, but are not limited to, drop structures,
stilling basins, check dams, placement of rip-rap and weirs.
      J.   Off-site discharge. If it is necessary to discharge a concentration
of surface runoff onto an adjoining property, provisions shall be made to
dissipate the erosive energy from said concentration of runoff and to maintain
the general drainage pattern as it existed prior to construction of the
subdivision improvements. It shall be the developer's responsibility to acquire
permanent easements from the adjoining property owner.
      K.   Extension to boundary. Storm sewers and appurtenances thereto shall
be extended to the boundary of the plat of subdivision where necessary for
collecting and/or discharging runoff as determined by the City Engineer.
   10.   Franchise Utilities. All public utility lines and appurtenances
thereto; including, but not limited to, electrical, gas, and telecommunication
lines; shall be buried underground within public utility easements provided for
said public utilities in accordance with city code. The developer shall be
responsible for making the necessary arrangements with each of the serving
utilities to comply with this requirement, including payment of any
construction or installation charges or fees by any utility company.
   11.   Sidewalks. Public sidewalks with a minimum width of five feet are
required along the frontages of all public streets and along not less than one
side of all common private access drives, unless alternative routing such as a
rear lot walkway or open space trail system is approved by the City Council on
a valid preliminary plat. The developer shall be responsible for constructing
two ADA-compliant ramps and the common square at each corner of all
intersections, unless otherwise specifically approved on the preliminary plat.
The developer shall be responsible for constructing all sidewalks within the
subdivision that do not front on a buildable lot as a plat improvement. In
certain unique cases, upon recommendation of the Community Development
Director, sidewalk construction may be deferred by City Council provided a
sidewalk deferral agreement is recorded requiring the property owner to pave
the sidewalk or to allow the city to pave the sidewalk and assess 100 percent
of the cost of the sidewalk to the property.
   12.   Recreational Trails and Shared Use Paths.
      A.   In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and the Parks and Open
Space Plan, recreational trails and shared use paths shall be paved to a
minimum width of eight feet (8') when located within a park or open space
corridor, or a width of ten feet (10') when located within or in proximity to a
street right-of-way, and shall be constructed of PCC unless an alternative
material is approved by the City Engineer. Base preparation and all other
construction specifications shall be fully compliant with SUDAS.
      B.   Costs; responsibilities . When shared use paths are constructed by
the developer as a subdivision improvement, the developer shall be responsible
for all construction costs. If the city agrees to allow the construction of the
shared use path to be deferred until a building permit is issued for specific
lot(s), the requirement for the property owner of said lots to pave the shared
use path shall be noted on the final plat, including specifications for the
type, width, and thickness of pavement.
   13.   Cluster Mailboxes. All lots in all subdivisions shall be served by a
cluster box unit ("CBU"); private mailboxes serving individual lots shall not
be permitted in new subdivisions. The developer shall be responsible for paving
an ADA compliant Portland Cement Concrete pad and the accessory four (4) feet
wide sidewalk that connects to the public sidewalk system. The developer shall
be responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the United States
Postal Service, including but not limited to obtaining approval from the
Postmaster of the CBU locations prior to submitting construction drawings for
subdivision improvements and for the cost of providing and installing each CBU
in the subdivision.
   14.   Streetlights. The developer shall cause plans and specifications to be
prepared for street lighting on all new public streets within the subdivision,

   1.   Whenever the tract proposed to be subdivided is characterized by unique

this chapter would result in substantial hardships or injustices that are not
self-created by the developer, the city council, upon recommendation of the
commission, may vary or modify such requirements so that the subdivider is
allowed to develop the property in a reasonable manner; but so, at the same
time, the public welfare and interest of the city and surrounding area are
protected and the general intent and the spirit of this chapter are preserved.
   2.   Any such variation or exception shall be limited to the minimum relief
that is necessary for a subdivision that creates lots for reasonable
development of the real property.
   3.   The request for such variation or exception shall be provided by the

or concurrently with the filing of a preliminary plat. The request shall be

      A.   A preliminary plat that has been approved in accordance with this
Code shall remain valid for two calendar years after the date upon which the
City Council approved the preliminary plat, and its validity and approval shall
thereafter expire unless a final plat has been submitted in accordance with
this section expressly, and in accordance with this Code as a whole, or unless
a time extension has been approved in the manner provided by this section.
      B.   During its time of validity, the developer shall cause construction
drawings for subdivision improvements to be prepared and submitted for review
and approval by the City Engineer, and a final plat to be filed for one or more
phases of the preliminary plat as had been designated on the approved plat, or
for the entire preliminary plat.
   2.   Expiration of preliminary plat.
      A.   Failure to file a proper and complete final plat submittal with the
Community Development Director within two calendar years from the date of
approval of the preliminary plat shall render said preliminary plat approval
null and void, unless the preliminary plat's validity has been extended in
accordance with this section.
      B.   A final plat submittal shall not be deemed to be properly filed
unless the City Engineer has first approved the construction drawings for
subdivision improvements for the real property that is included in the final
plat. It shall be the developer's duty to ensure said plans and specifications
are filed with the City Engineer sufficiently in advance of the preliminary
plat's expiration to enable the plans and specifications to be reviewed, and
revised to whatever extent that may be necessary to attain full compliance with
all applicable requirements and approval by the City Engineer.
      C.   Time extension for a preliminary plat.
         (1)   The approval and recording of a final plat for one phase of a
valid preliminary plat shall be deemed to automatically extend the validity and
approval of the remainder of the preliminary plat for a period of one calendar
year beyond the date of the City Council's approval of such final plat. For
plats having more than two phases, the validity of the preliminary plat shall
be automatically extended one year each time the City Council approves a final
plat within the boundary of the approved preliminary plat.
         (2)   The City Council may, upon request from the developer and
following review and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, re-
approve and thereby grant a time extension for a valid preliminary plat, but
only if the preliminary plat and the subdivision improvement plans and
specifications are updated to comply with and conform to all codes,
regulations, requirements and specifications that have been revised or adopted
since the original date of approval of the preliminary plat.
   3.   Expiration of final plat.
      A.   Approval of a final plat by resolution of the City Council, the

provisions of this Code, and shall cause the final plat to be properly
submitted for filing of record in the offices of the appropriate County
Recorder, Auditor and Assessor, within one calendar year of the date of the
City Council's resolution; noncompliance shall render the City Council's
approval and resolution to be null and void.
