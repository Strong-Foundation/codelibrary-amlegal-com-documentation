46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco 46.04 Minors in Taverns
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
   A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
   B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
   C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
   D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
   F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

those weeks between school years).

16 and 17 to be or remain upon any of the alleys, streets or public places or

within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
   D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.

  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we

officer.
   D.   In the event that a dangerous animal is found at large and unattended
upon public property, park property, public right-of-way or the property of
someone other than its owner, caretaker or custodian, thereby creating a hazard
to persons or property, such animal may, in the discretion of the enforcement

animal behavior modification course at the owner, caretaker or custodian’s
expense instructed by a licensed or certified animal behavior specialist within
30 days after receipt of a Dangerous Animal Order. The owner, caretaker or
custodian shall be required to provide a copy of proof of successful completion
of the course to the Police Chief and the proof shall include certification or
receipt bearing the name of the instructor and the dates of instruction.
      (6)   The owner, caretaker or custodian must, within 30 days of receipt
of a Dangerous Animal Order, at the owner, caretaker or custodian’s expense,

enforcement officer pursuant to subsection 4 above may be appealed to the
Council. To appeal such Dangerous Animal Order, written notice of appeal must
be filed with the City Administrator within five business days after receipt of
the Dangerous Animal Order. Failure to file such written notice of appeal shall
constitute a waiver of right to appeal the Dangerous Animal Order of the
enforcement officer.
   B.   The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal and shall
be delivered personally or by certified mail to the City Administrator. Upon
receiving a notice of appeal, a hearing shall be convened to receive any

Animal Order.
   C.   When an appeal has been filed, the enforcement officer shall make a

take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and may take into
custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority may
employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private entity,
equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving, storing, or
disposing of abandoned vehicles. A property owner or other person in control of
private property may employ a private entity that is a garage keeper to dispose
of an abandoned vehicle, and the private entity may take into custody the
abandoned vehicle without a police authority’s initiative. If a police
authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles, the police
authority shall provide the private entity with the names and addresses of the
registered owners, all lienholders of record, and any other known claimant to
the vehicle or the personal property found in the vehicle.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[2])
80.03   NOTICE BY MAIL.
The police authority or private entity that takes into custody an abandoned
vehicle shall notify, within 20 days, by certified mail, the last known

been taken into custody. Notice shall be deemed given when mailed. The notice

vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The notice
shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity
may claim a garage keeper’s lien as described in Section 321.90 of the Code of
Iowa, and may proceed to sell or dispose of the vehicle. If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a police authority or by a private entity
hired by a police authority, the notice shall state that any person claiming
rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the
planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police authority or
private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this
section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to
contest those matters. If the persons receiving notice do not ask for a hearing
or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
10-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,
title, claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders or claimants after the
expiration of the 10-day reclaiming period.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.04   NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.
If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the

Notes
5 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 2010-08 adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on October 4, 2010.
110.02   RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa.
110.03   PIPES AND MAINS.
Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the purpose
of laying, relaying, repairing, or extending gas pipes, mains, conduits, and
other facilities, provided that the same shall be so placed as not to
unreasonably interfere with the construction of any water pipes, drain, or
sewer or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may hereafter be
located by authority of the City.
110.04   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in accordance
with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on file with and made effective by the
Iowa Utilities Board, as may subsequently be amended (“Tariff’), at its cost
and expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or equipment in, on,
over or under any public street or alley in the City in such a manner as the
City may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating the construction,
reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the street or alley. The City and the
Company shall work together to develop a suitable alternative route or
construction method so as to eliminate or minimize the cost and expense to the
Company of relocation of Company installations. If the City has a reasonable
alternative route for the street, alley or public improvements or an
alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the
Company installations, the City shall select said alternative route, or
construction method. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested, the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,
copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross section drawings. If tree
removals must be completed by the City as part of the City’s project and are
necessary whether or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City, at its
own cost, shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree
removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
Company must remove trees that are included in the City’s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove the trees at its cost or reimburse the
Company for the expenses incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a
source other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
110.05   EXCAVATIONS.
In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places for the
installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the surface,
restoring it to the condition as existed prior to excavation. The Company shall
not be required to restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks, or other
areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its
immediate previously existing condition or to a condition required for the City
to comply with City, State or federal rules, regulations or law. Company agrees
any replacement of road surface shall conform to this Code of Ordinances
regarding its depth and composition.
110.06   UTILITY EASEMENTS.
Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground, or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley, or public ground where the
Company has natural gas facilities, in the vicinity, the City shall provide
Company with not less than 60 days’ advance notice of the City’s proposed
action and, upon request, grant the Company a utility easement covering
existing and future facilities and activities. The City shall grant the Company
a utility easement for said facilities. If the City fails to grant the Company
a utility easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a
street, avenue, alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost and expense
obtain easements for existing Company facilities.
110.07   RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.
The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right-of-way that have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City in the previous seven years.
110.08   RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.
Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by this
chapter, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in order to facilitate the project of a commercial or
private developer or non-public entity, the City shall reimburse or the City
shall require the developer or non-public entity to reimburse the Company for
the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocation of its existing
facilities or equipment. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order
to facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation, or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by the franchise;
provided, however, the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify, and
save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from the
negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
110.10   INFORMATION PROVIDED.
Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way. The Company and City
recognize the information provided will, under current Iowa law, constitute
public records, but that nonetheless, some information provided will be
confidential under State or federal law or both. Therefore, the City shall not
release any information with respect to the location or type of equipment which
the Company owns or controls in the right-of-way which may constitute a trade
secret or which may otherwise be protected from public disclosure by State or
federal law. Furthermore, the City agrees that no documents, maps or
information provided to the City by the Company shall be made available to the
public or other entities if such documents or information are exempt from
disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission Critical Energy Infrastructure requirements
pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as

During the term of the franchise, the Company shall furnish natural gas in the
quantity and quality consistent and in accordance with the applicable
regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors and Iowa law.
110.12   FRANCHISE FEES.
1.   There is hereby imposed upon and shall be collected from the natural gas
customers of MidAmerican Energy Company receiving service pursuant to the
Tariff located within the corporate limits of the City and remitted by the
Company to the City, a franchise fee from each revenue class as set forth below
of the gross receipts, minus uncollectable amounts, derived by the Company from
the delivery and sale of natural gas to customers within the corporate limits
of the City:
      Residential Customers        zero  percent
      Commercial Customers        zero  percent
      Industrial Customers        zero  percent
      Public Authority Customers        zero  percent
      Distribution (Transportation) Customers        zero  percent
   The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt certain types or classes of
sales from imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease, or eliminate
the franchise fee. The City does therefore exempt the customer classes or
customer groups shown below from franchise fees. The City reserves the right to
cancel any or all the franchise fee exemptions and also reserves the right to
grant exemptions to additional customers or customer classes in compliance with
Iowa law and subsection 3 of this section.
2.   Customer classes initially exempted by the City:
      - NONE -
3.   The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in
any 24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting certain types or classes of
customers, increasing, decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee
shall become effective, and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an
agreed upon date which is not less than 60 days following written notice to the
Company by certified mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such
new ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the Council.
4.   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following 90 days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the franchise fee, including the City’s documentation of consumers subject to
or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide the
information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the Company.
The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a list of
premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of the
City.
5.   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customers subject to
or exempt from paying the City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall be solely
responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including, over
time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customers that it wishes to
subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying the franchise
fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail, copies of
annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate franchise fee
collection from customers within the corporate limits of the City. The Company
shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from customers in annexed
areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided to the Company by
certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting franchise fees in the
annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving annexation ordinances from
the City.
6.   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising out
of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In
addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from
any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified,
by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a
different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.
7.   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
quarter as follows.
      January, February and March
      April, May and June
      July, August and September, and
      October, November and December
   MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of
any changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
8.   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
9.   MidAmerican Energy Company shall not, under any circumstances be required
to return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City
customers and remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to
provide data or information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise
fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or
calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the
City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to
provide such data or information.
10.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is
modified or repealed if:
   A.   Any other person is authorized to sell natural gas at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate.
   B.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural gas at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of natural gas within the City.
   C.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final non-appealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within a reasonable time after
final franchise fee action, the parties shall meet to determine whether this
chapter can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the franchise fee on a
continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After final franchise fee
action and until passage by the City of revisions to the franchise fee
ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and remittance of the
franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is required to do so in
order to comply with revised legal requirements.
11.   The other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee, effective as of the date specified below, with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   A.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
   B.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   C.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
110.13   RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT FEE.
The City shall not, pursuant to Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or
charge Company right-of-way management fees for permits for Company
construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation, pavement cutting, or
inspections of Company work sites and projects or related matters.
110.14   TERMINATION.
Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate the franchise if the other party
shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for
cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching
party may terminate the franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in
breach of the franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal
law. A party shall not be considered to have breached the franchise if the
alleged breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other
party.

new ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the Council.
4.   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following 90 days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the franchise fee, including the City’s documentation of consumers subject to
or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide the
information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the Company.
The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a list of
premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of the
City.
5.   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customers subject to
or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall be solely
responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including, over
time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customers that it wishes to
subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying the franchise
fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail, copies of
annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate franchise fee
collection from customers within the corporate limits of the City. The Company
shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from customers in annexed
areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided to the Company by
certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting franchise fees in the
annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving annexation ordinances from
the City.
6.   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising out
of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In
addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from
any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified,
by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a
different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.
7.   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
quarter as follows.
      January, February and March
      April, May and June
      July, August and September, and
      October, November and December
   MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of
any changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
8.   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
9.   MidAmerican Energy Company shall not, under any circumstances, be required
to return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City
customers and remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to
provide data or information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise
fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or
calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the
City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to
provide such data or information.
10.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is
modified or repealed if:
   A.   Any other person is authorized to sell electricity at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate.
   B.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
electricity at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of electricity within the City.
   C.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final non-appealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within a reasonable time following
final franchise fee action, the parties shall meet to determine whether this
ordinance can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the franchise fee on a
continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After final franchise fee
action and until passage by the City of revisions to the franchise fee
ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and remittance of the
franchise fee if, in its sole opinion, it believes it is required to do so in
order to comply with revised legal requirements.
11.   The other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   A.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
   B.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   C.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
111.14   RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT FEE.
The City shall not, pursuant to Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or
charge right-of-way management fees upon the Company or fees for permits for
Company construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation, pavement cutting or
inspections of Company work sites and projects or related matters.
111.15   TERMINATION.
Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a longer period for cure. If the
breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching party may
terminate the franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in breach of the
franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal law. A party
shall not be considered to have breached the franchise if the alleged breach is
the result of the actions of a third party or the other party.

rights or powers which have been or will be enacted or established subject to
the provisions of subsection 1.

provision governing the franchise shall constitute a waiver of any lawful
governmental right or power of the City.

administrative duty imposed upon any elected official of the City shall be
subject to transfer by the City to any other elected official, officer,

All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines, and equipment
installed or erected by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be so
located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public
ways, and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own
property that adjoins any of such public ways. A grantee shall first obtain a
permit from the City prior to commencing construction on the streets, alleys,
public grounds, or places and shall be on a form provided by the City. A
grantee shall not open or disturb the surface of any street, sidewalk,
driveway, or public place for any purpose without having first obtained a
permit to do so in the manner provided by ordinance. All excavation shall be
coordinated with other utility excavation or construction so as to minimize
disruption to the public.
112.12   RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
If during the course of Grantee’s construction, operation, or maintenance of
the cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the Grantee,
the Grantee shall, at its own expense, replace and restore such public way to a
condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the public way existing
immediately prior to such disturbance.
112.13   RELOCATION AT REQUEST OF CITY.
Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than 10 business
days, the Grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily
disconnect, relocate in the public way, or remove from the public way any
property of the Grantee when lawfully required by the City by reason of traffic
conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction,
change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or
water pipes or any other type of structures or improvements by the City; but
the Grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property.
If public funds are available to any person using such street, easement, or
right-of-way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the
City shall provide notice to the Grantee of the City’s application for such
funds and shall allow the Grantee to apply on its own behalf of such funds.
112.14   SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
Construction, installation, and maintenance of the system shall be performed in
an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in
substantial accordance with applicable FCC or other Federal, State, and local
regulations and the National Electric Safety Code. The cable system shall not
unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of persons or property in
the service area.
112.15   UNDERGROUND AND OVER-GROUND INSTALLATION.
1.   Pole Agreements. The Grantee may lease, rent, or in any other manner by
mutual agreement obtain the use of towers, poles, lines, cables, and other
equipment and facilities from utility companies operating within the City, and
use towers, poles, lines, cables, and other equipment and facilities for the
system. When and where practicable, the poles used by the Grantee’s
distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by such utility
companies operating within the City, provided mutually satisfactory rental
agreements can be reached. It is the City’s desire that all holders of public
franchises in the City cooperate with the Grantee and allow the Grantee the use
of their poles and pole line facilities whenever possible so that the number of
new or additional poles installed in the City may be minimized.
2.   Grantee’s Poles. The Grantee shall have the right to erect, install, and
maintain its own towers, poles, guys, anchors, underground conduits, and
manholes as may be necessary for the proper construction and maintenance of the
antenna site, headend, and distribution system, providing that the Grantee has
at the worksite the necessary City permit or copy thereof, for scheduled work,
obtained in advance from the appropriate department of the City.
3.   Rent of Grantee’s Poles. A Grantee shall have the right to establish
terms, conditions, and specifications governing the form, type, size, quantity,
and location of equipment of others on its poles, and shall have the further
right to charge a fair rental for attachment space or spaces occupied by the
said equipment and plant of others, except that no rent shall be paid by the
City for its attachment to the Grantee’s poles and such use shall be
noncommercial and may not be supplied for any municipal use directly competing
with the Grantee. The City shall pay any costs incurred by a Grantee in
providing space for a City’s attachments, including any necessary
rearrangements of a Grantee’s equipment and plant to provide room for City’s
attachments. Upon expiration, termination, or revocation of a franchise, or
should a Grantee wish to dispose of any of its poles, conduit or manholes,
being used by the City, the City shall have the option to purchase them in
place for their fair market value.

underground to the maximum extent the then existing technology permits, in
accordance with the most recent National Electrical Code, and its successor
document, as well as in conformance with all applicable State and municipal
ordinances and codes. If and when necessary, amplifiers and/or transformers in
the Grantee’s transmission and distribution lines shall be in appropriate
housings on the surface of the ground. The Grantee shall obtain a permit from
the City for such underground construction of all work required or pursuant to
this section. Even when not required, underground installation is preferable to
the placing of additional poles.
5.   Compliance to Codes. All transmission and distribution structures, lines,
and equipment erected by the Grantee in the City shall be located so as not to
endanger or interfere with the normal use of streets, alleys, or other public
ways and places so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or
reasonable convenience of the general public and adjoining property owners and
so as not to interfere with existing public utility installations and so as to
comply with the most recent National Electrical Code, as amended, as well as in
conformance with all applicable State and municipal ordinances and codes of
general applicability. In the case of any disturbance by the Grantee or its
equipment of pavement, sidewalks, driveway, lawn, or other surfacing, the
Grantee shall, at its expense and in the manner required by the City, promptly
replace and restore all such surfacing to a reasonably comparable condition.

cable communications system shall meet all of the following safety,
construction, and technical specifications and codes and standards:

above or below ground shall be so placed as to comply with all the lawful
requirements of the City.
7.   Moving Permits. The Grantee shall, on request of any persons holding a
moving permit issued by the City, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to
permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal shall be
paid in advance by the person requesting the same, and the Grantee shall be
given not less than seven business days’ advance notice to arrange for such
temporary changes.
8.   Authority to Trim Trees and Shrubbery. The Grantee shall have the
authority under the supervision and direction of the City to trim trees or
other natural growth overhanging any of its cable system in the street or alley
right-of-way so as to prevent branches from coming in contact with the
Grantee’s wires, cables, or other equipment. The Grantee shall reasonably
compensate the City or property owner for any damages caused by such trimming,
or shall, in its sole discretion, and at its own cost and expense, reasonably
replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any construction of the
cable system undertaken by Grantee. Such replacement shall satisfy any and all
obligations Grantee may have to the City pursuant to the terms of this section.
9.   Service Area. The Grantee shall design and construct the cable system in
such a manner as to pass by and provide adequate tap-off facilities for every
single-family dwelling, multiple-family dwelling, apartment, school, and
government building located within the City limits, based upon the corporate
boundaries at the time of the granting of the franchise, provided that such
locations meet the density requirements pursuant to Section
112.16 – Extension of Service.
10.   Underground Construction. Grantee shall participate in and use Iowa One
Call and ensure that cable is buried pursuant to standards established by Iowa
One Call or any State-mandated successor agency.

month period, the Grantee shall provide basic and expanded basic cable service
without charge to the affected cable subscriber from the last date that the
drop was to have been buried to that actual date that it is buried.
12.   Closing of Streets. The Grantee shall not be entitled to damages from the
City sustained by the virtue of the closing, vacation, or relocation of any
streets or alleys.
13.   Private Easements. No cable, line, wire, amplifier, converter, or other
pieces of equipment owned by the Grantee shall be installed by the Grantee
within private easements without first securing the written permission of the
owner, lessee, or tenant of the property involved, unless a private easement is
determined to be available for use by the Grantee in accordance with applicable
law.
112.16   EXTENSION OF SERVICE.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall require that a Grantee
shall, at its expense, promptly extend its system to have service available to
all potential subscribers of:
1.   The corporate limits of the City and newly annexed areas to the City, not
then served by a cable system, where the average density is at least 10
potential subscribers per lineal one-quarter mile of the proposed trunk and
feeder cable route.
2.   Any new single-family dwelling unit, commercial establishment, or
potential subscriber within 250 feet of the existing distribution system in the
City, upon request of the potential subscriber.
3.   No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual
circumstances, such as: (i) existence of more than 250 feet of distance from
the distribution cable to the connection point of service to the customers; or
(ii) a density of less than ten potential subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing
strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made available on
the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of
material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of
capital contribution in the aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and
the customers in the area in which service may be expanded, the Grantee will
contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per one-quarter
mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of
residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution
cable, and whose denominator equals ten potential subscribers. Customers who
request service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other
costs on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the
capital contribution in aid of the construction borne by such potential
customers be paid in advance.

prescribe ten days’ advance disconnect notice requirements for use when a
subscriber voluntarily elects to disconnect cable service. If any subscriber
fails to pay a fee or charge, a Grantee may disconnect the subscriber’s
service. Such disconnection shall not be effected until the subscriber has been
given ten days’ advance written notice of the intention to disconnect. After
disconnection, upon payment of any required delinquent fee or reconnection
charge, the Grantee shall reinstate the subscriber’s service.

112.45 hereof. Furthermore, payments of this ongoing support shall not be
deemed to be “franchise fees” within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable
Act and such payment shall not be deemed to be “payments-in-kind” or any
involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the City
by a Grantee pursuant to Section
112.45 hereof. A Grantee shall be allowed to collect such fee as a pass-through
to cable subscribers. This fee shall be revised on an annual basis in

or subleased cable services, pay-per-view, miscellaneous revenue, and such
other relevant facts, as may be required by the City, necessary to determine
the accuracy of the franchise payment as specified in of this chapter. The
acceptance of any payment shall not be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be
construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums
payable by the Grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and re-
computation by the City. The Grantee shall permit the City, upon request with
reasonable notice, to review at Grantee’s local office its gross revenue
records as may be necessary to monitor compliance with this section.

Any proceedings undertaken by the City that relate to the renewal of a
Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of

protections set forth therein shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded by
the provisions of any subsequent provision of federal or State law.

If a renewal or extension of a Grantee’s franchise is denied or the franchise
is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the
cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the
cable system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a
price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the
Cable Act. In the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the
franchise, at the Grantee’s request, which shall be made in its sole
discretion, the Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a
transfer of its system to a qualified third party. During such a period of time
the City shall authorize the Grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the
terms of its prior franchise. However, in no event shall such authorization
exceed a period of time greater than six months from the effective date of such
revocation. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in
procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its system which is reasonably
acceptable to the City, the Grantee and the City may avail themselves of any
rights they may have pursuant to Federal or State law. The Grantee may continue
to operate of its system during the six-month period, and it shall not be
deemed to be a waiver or extinguishments of any right of either the City or the
Grantee.

controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without
the prior written consent of the City. Such consent, as required by the City,
shall be given or denied no later than 120 days following any request and shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Prior consent shall not be required when
transferring the franchise between wholly owned subsidiaries of the same
entity. Nor shall such consent be required for a transfer in trust, by
mortgage, by other hypothecation, or assignment of any rights, title, or
interest of the Grantee in the cable system in order to secure indebtedness.
2.   Ownership or Control. In the event that the Grantee sells or otherwise
transfers ownership in the cable system, such sale or transfer shall conform
with Section 617 of the Cable Act. For the purpose of determining whether it
shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the City may
in accordance with Section 617 inquire into the qualifications of the
prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist the City in any
such inquiry. In seeking the City’s consent to any change in ownership or
control, the transferee shall have the responsibility:
   A.   To show to the satisfaction of the City whether the proposed purchaser,
transferee, or assignee (the “proposed transferee), which in the case of a
corporation, shall include all directors and all persons having a legal or
equitable interest of 50 percent or more of the voting stock:

misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of
competent jurisdiction; or

withhold approval of the transfer until the transferee has provided the
information required in this subsection.
   B.   To establish the financial solvency of the proposed transferee by
submitting all current financial data for the proposed transferee and such
other data to determine the legal, financial, and technical qualification of
the transferee.
   C.   To establish that the technical capability of the proposed transferee
is such as shall enable it to maintain and operate the cable system for the
remaining term of the franchise under the existing franchise terms.
3.   Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets
for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the City that the financial
institution, or its designee, as approved in writing by the City, shall take
control and operate the cable system in the event of a Grantee default in its
financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a
plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with
all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the cable system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the
City at its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the right
to petition the City to transfer the franchise to another Grantee. Except
insofar as the enforceability of this subsection may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally, and further subject to applicable federal, State
or local law, if the City finds that such transfer, after considering the
legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualities of
the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the City shall transfer and assign
the right and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.
4.   The consent or approval of the City to any transfer by the Grantee shall
not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the
streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of any franchise.
5.   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without
the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the Franchise Agreement.
6.   The City may approve the transfer or deny the transfer pursuant to Section
617 of the Cable Act.
7.   When the City approves a transfer under this section, the new Grantee
shall indicate acceptance of the franchise as specified in Section
112.09, including the filing of all necessary bonds, funds, proofs of insurance
and certifications.
The restrictions of this section shall be effective immediately upon execution
of a franchise agreement.
112.50   RIGHT OF INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION.
The City shall have the right to visually inspect all construction or
installation work performed subject to the provisions of this chapter and to
make such visual inspections as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other pertinent provision of law.
112.51   NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
The Grantee is encouraged to upgrade its facilities, equipment, and service so
that its cable system is as advanced as the current state of production
technology will allow. New developments shall be a topic of discussion at all
review sessions and shall be a factor to be considered in connection with
requests for rate adjustments, pursuant to FCC rules and regulations.
112.52   CITY’S RIGHT TO PURCHASE SYSTEM.
The City shall be entitled to a right of first refusal of any bona fide offer
to purchase the cable system made to Grantee if the cable system is being sold
separately and such sale is not linked in any way to the sale of any other
cable system in a separate franchise area. “Bona fide offer,” as used in this
section, means a written offer which has been accepted by Grantee subject to
the City’s rights under this chapter. The City shall notify Grantee of its
interest in purchasing the cable system within 30 days of the City’s receipt
from Grantee of copy of the written bona fide offer. Payment shall be made upon
closing in readily available funds within 120 days of the City’s receipt from
Grantee of a copy of the written bona fide offer. The price to be paid by the
City shall be the fair market value of the cable system or the actual price
which has been negotiated at arm’s length between the parties, whichever is
greater, or the amount offered in the bona fide offer if only the Eagle Grove
franchise is to be purchased.
112.53   TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE.
The Grantee shall meet or exceed all FCC minimum performance and technical
standards. The City shall have the right to compel the Grantee to provide
results of Grantee’s testing of the cable system. In the event that the City
has evidence of noncompliance, the City may also perform technical tests of the
cable system during reasonable times and in a manner which does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the Grantee or
the cable system in order to determine whether or not the Grantee is in
compliance with the terms hereof and applicable State or Federal laws. Such
tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice
thereof, not to be less than ten business days, and providing a representative
of the Grantee has an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event
that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially failed to
comply with a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests
shall be borne by the Grantee. In the event that such testing demonstrates that
the Grantee has substantially complied with such material provisions hereof,
the cost of such testing shall be borne by the City. Except in emergency
circumstances, the City agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no more
than once a year, and that the results thereof shall be made available to the
Grantee. Any such special performance tests or measurements required by the
City shall be reported to the City within fourteen (14) business days after
such test or measurements are performed. Such report shall include the
following information: (i) the nature of the complaint which precipitated the
special tests; (ii) what system component was tested, the equipment used, and
procedures employed in said testing; (iii) the results of such tests; and (iv)
the method in which such complaints were resolved. Any other information
pertinent to the special test shall be recorded.
112.54   BOOKS AND RECORDS.
The City or its certified public accountant upon reasonable notice to the
Grantee may review such of its books and records at the Grantee’s business
office, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as is
reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms hereof. Such records
shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public records required to be
kept by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall
not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature under State and Federal rules of
evidence. The City agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as
confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents
thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.
The Grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in
violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
112.55   COMMUNICATIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES.
Copies of all petitions, applications, communications, reports, and all other
documents pertaining to the cable system and franchise submitted by the Grantee
or its parent companies to the FCC, Securities Exchange Commission, or any
other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency shall be made available
to the City upon written request to the Grantee.
112.56   COMPLAINT RECORDS.
A written log or an equivalent, stored in computer memory and capable of access
and reproduction, shall be maintained for all service interruptions or
complaints regarding system service problems. The Grantee shall maintain
detailed logs setting forth the date and substance of each service interruption
or complaint regarding the system service problems received by phone, mail or
other means during the preceding calendar month, and the date and nature of
action taken by the Grantee to respond to such complaints, or, if still
pending, the status thereof. Such logs shall be available to the City for
review for one year thereafter. A “complaint” as used herein shall be a written
complaint from a subscriber regarding signal quality or service, but not
regarding programming or rates, which in the case of oral complaints is not
resolved within the original telephone call or visit from the subscriber.
112.57   CITY ROLE IN COMPLAINTS.
Unresolved complaints concerning the system or its operation or maintenance may
be directed to the City Administrator. The procedure to handle complaints shall
be as follows:
1.   Within 30 days from the occurrence of the facts and circumstances giving
rise to a complaint or grievance, the complainant shall state his or her
complaint or grievance to the Grantee in writing. In the event such a complaint
or grievance is received by the City, the same shall be forwarded to Grantee in
writing.
2.   Within five business days after the receipt by the Grantee of a complaint
from the City, the Grantee shall state to complainant its intentions with
respect to the complaint in writing.
3.   Unresolved complaints concerning the system or its operation or
maintenance shall be directed to the City. The City shall promptly forward the
complaint to the Grantee or shall take the question up by correspondence with
the Grantee. Within such time as may be reasonably prescribed by the City, the
Grantee shall resolve the complaint or advise the City of its refusal or
inability to do so. When the Grantee resolves the complaint, it shall so notify
the City. If a complaint has not been resolved, the City may take any
appropriate action authorized by this chapter.
4.   All subscribers shall be notified by the Grantee at the time of their
initial installation that the City is the local franchising authority. The
Grantee shall notify subscribers on the cable bills on an annual basis that
complaints can be filed with the City.
5.   Nothing herein shall limit or alter the requirement or requirements
contained in this chapter for customer service standards.
6.   The City shall be notified of action taken to resolve grievances or
complaints.
112.58   PERFORMANCE TESTING.
Grantee shall perform all cable system tests and maintenance procedures as
required by the FCC and this chapter.
112.59   REVIEW SESSIONS.
1.   Purpose of Review Sessions. In recognition of the fact that a great many
technical, financial, marketing, and legal uncertainties are associated with
all aspects of cable communications at the present time, it is the intent of
the City to provide for a maximum feasible degree of flexibility in a Franchise
throughout its term to achieve an advanced and modern cable system for the
City. The principal means for accomplishing this flexibility will be the
scheduled review sessions provided for in this chapter. It is intended that
such review sessions will serve as a means of cooperatively working out
solutions to problems that develop. Furthermore, such review sessions shall be
two-way processes. For example, if either party has perceived that some major
problem has developed, the session shall be devoted primarily to working out
solutions acceptable to both parties.
2.   Topics to be Covered. The City and the Grantee shall hold scheduled review
sessions on the third and sixth anniversary dates of the effective date of the
franchise agreement. All such review sessions shall be open to the public and
notice thereof shall be published once, not less than four days or more than 20
days before each review session, as provided by law. The published notice shall
specify the topics to be discussed. The review sessions may be canceled by
mutual agreement of the City and Grantee. The following topics may be discussed
at every scheduled review session:
   Recent and developing judicial and Federal communications rulings
   Service rate structures
   Free and discounted services
   Application of new technology or new developments
   Cable system performance
   Cable system extension policy
   Services provided
   Programming offered
   Customer complaints review
   Community development and education
   Interconnection
   New services
   Subscriber privacy abuse issues
   Franchise fees
   Other topics, in addition to those listed, may be added by either party.
Members of the general public may also request additional topics.
112.60   REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY.
The City, acting alone or acting jointly with other franchising authorities,
may exercise or delegate the following responsibilities:
1.   Administering the provision of a cable system franchise;
2.   Coordinating the operation of a local access channel and facilities;
3.   Providing technical, programming, and operational support to public agency
users, such as government departments, schools, and health care institutions;
4.   Establishing jointly with a Grantee, or as otherwise specified in the
Franchise Agreement, procedures and standards for use of channels dedicated to
public use and the sharing of public facilities, if provided for in any
Franchise Agreement;
5.   Planning the expansion and growth of public benefit cable services;
6.   Analyzing the possibility of integrating cable systems with other local,
regional, or national telecommunications networks;
7.   Formulating and recommending long-range telecommunications policy.
112.61   ANNUAL REPORT.
No later than 90 days after the close of a Grantee’s fiscal year, and upon
written request, the Grantee shall submit a detailed written informative report
to the City, including the following information:
1.   A summary of the previous year’s activities in development of the cable
system, including (but not limited to) services begun or dropped and newly
served geographic areas within the City limits.
2.   A summary of complaints, identifying the number and specific nature of
complaints and their disposition.
3.   A list of key management for the Eagle Grove franchise along with their
addresses and job titles.
4.   The annual report of the parent company, if a public corporation. Such
report shall be construed to mean the report of the previous year.
5.   The total estimated annual value of the potential revenue from cable
services provided in the service area without charge or provided under a barter
arrangement, along with the total estimated number of persons who are provided
cable services in the service area without charge or under a barter agreement.
112.62   INDEMNIFICATION.
Any Grantee shall defend, indemnify, protect, and hold harmless the City from
and against any and all liability, losses, and damage to property or bodily
injury or death to any person, including payments made under worker’s
compensation laws, which may arise out of or be caused by the erection,
construction, replacement, removal, maintenance, or operation of Grantee’s
cable system and caused by any act or failure to act on the part of the
Grantee, its agents, officers, servants, or employees. The City shall give the
Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify, within 30 days following
service of a petition or other similar pleading. If the City determines that it
is necessary for it to employ separate counsel, the costs for such separate
counsel shall be the responsibility of the City.
112.63   INSURANCE COVERAGE AND NOTIFICATIONS.
A Grantee shall maintain insurance in such amounts and kinds of coverage as may
be specified by the City in the Franchise Agreement. Such coverage may be
reasonably adjusted by the City with 90-day notification, provided that the
City demonstrates the need for increases in coverage. The Grantee shall
maintain such insurance with insurance underwriters authorized to do business
in the State of Iowa. All policies shall name the City, its employees,
servants, agents, and officers as additional insured parties. Each policy shall
provide that it may not be canceled nor the amount of coverage altered until 30
days after receipt by the City Clerk of a registered mail notice of such intent
to cancel or alter coverage. The Grantee shall provide a certificate of
insurance designating the City as an “additional insured.” The Grantee shall
maintain and provide to the City proof of public liability insurance for not
less than the amounts specified in the Franchise Agreement.
112.64   INSURANCE FOR CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS.
Any Grantee shall provide coverage for any contractor or subcontractor involved
in the construction, installation, maintenance, or operation of its cable
system by either obtaining the necessary endorsements to its insurance policies
or requiring such contractor or subcontractor to obtain appropriate insurance
coverage consistent with this section and appropriate to the extent of its
involvement in the construction, installation, maintenance, or operation of the
Grantee’s cable system.
112.65   FORECLOSURE.
A foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or part of the system shall be
treated as a change in control of the Grantee and the provisions of Section
112.66 of this chapter shall apply.
112.66   RECEIVERSHIP.
The City shall have the right to cancel the franchise 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or trustee, to take over and conduct the business of
the Grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other
action or proceedings, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless, within 120 days
after being elected or appointed, such receiver or trustee shall have fully
complied with all provisions of this chapter and remedied all defaults
thereunder and shall have executed an agreement, approved by the court having
jurisdiction, whereby such receiver or trustee agrees to be bound by this
chapter and the franchise granted to the Grantee.
112.67   CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.
1.   Right to Continuous Service. It shall be the right of all subscribers to
continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to
the Grantee are honored. In the event that the Grantee elects to rebuild,
modify, or sell the cable system, or the City gives notice in accordance with
the franchise or this chapter of intent to terminate or fails to renew this
franchise, the Grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive
continuous, uninterrupted service for six months. In the event of a change of
Grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the cable system, the original
Grantee shall cooperate with the City, new Grantee, or operator in maintaining
continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, Grantee shall be
entitled to the revenue for any period during which it operates the cable
system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its services when it no
longer operates the cable system.
2.   Right of City to Operate Cable System. In the event Grantee fails to
operate the system for seven consecutive days without prior approval of the
City or without just cause, the City may, working in conjunction with any
financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the
advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise,
operate the system or designate an operator until such time as Grantee restores
service under conditions acceptable to the City or a permanent operator is
selected. If the City is required to fulfill this obligation for the Grantee,
then during such period that the City fulfills such obligation, the City shall
be entitled to a reasonable management fee.
112.68   FRANCHISE PROCESSING COSTS.
1.   Initial Franchises. For an initial franchise awarded, the costs to be
borne by the Grantee shall include (but shall not be limited to) all costs of
publication of notices prior to any public meeting, publication of relevant
ordinances and franchise agreements, incurred by the City.
2.   Franchise Renewal. For a franchise renewal, the Grantee shall reimburse
the City the cost of publication of notices and publication of relevant
ordinances and franchise agreements.
3.   Franchise Transfer. For a franchise transfer, the transferee shall
reimburse the City the cost of publication of notices, publication of relevant
ordinances, and publication of franchise agreements. The City reserves the
right to withhold approval of such transfer until all costs have been
reimbursed by the transferee.
4.   Other Costs. The publication costs provided for in this section shall be
in addition to any other inspection or permit fee or other fees due to City
under any other ordinance of general applicability.
112.69   TAXES.
Subject to Federal and State law, the Grantee shall pay all real estate taxes,
special assessments, personal property taxes, license fees, permit fees, and
other generally applicable charges of a like nature which may be taxed,
charged, assessed, levied, or imposed upon the property of the Grantee and upon
any services rendered by the Grantee.
112.70   NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with the
terms of the franchise, it shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact
nature of the alleged noncompliance.
112.71   GRANTEE’S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND.
The Grantee shall have 30 days after receipt of the notice described in Section
112.70: (i) to respond to the City, contesting the assertion of noncompliance;
or (ii) to cure such default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of
default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate
reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being
taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
112.72   PUBLIC HEARING.
In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice described in
Section
112.70 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
112.71, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 30 days
of the date projected pursuant to 112.71 above, the City shall schedule a
public hearing to investigate the default. The City shall notify the Grantee in
writing of the time and place of such meeting no less than five business days
in advance and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard.
112.73   ENFORCEMENT.
Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the event the City, after such
public hearing, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of
the franchise, the City may:
1.   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself
to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;
2.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief; or
3.   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked in accordance with the
procedures outlined in this section.
The City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the
franchise on the basis of noncompliance by the Grantee, including one or more
instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the
franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance.
The Grantee shall have 90 days from such notice to object in writing and to
state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not received a
response satisfactory from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the
franchise at a public meeting. The City shall cause to be served upon the
Grantee, at least 10 days prior to such public meeting, a written notice
specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its intent to request
such termination. At the designated meeting, the City shall give the Grantee an
opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine
whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. The Grantee may appeal such
determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the
decision of the City de novo and to modify or reverse such decision as justice
may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within 60 days
of the issuance of the determination of the City. The City may, at its sole
discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the
City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.
112.74   PROMPT COMPLIANCE.
The Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with this chapter
by reason of the City’s failure to enforce prompt compliance.
112.75   IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE.
A Grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the provisions of
the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto where such
noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by the following circumstances if
reasonably beyond its control:
1.   Necessary utility rearrangements, pole change-outs or obtainment of
easement rights;
2.   Governmental or regulatory restrictions;
3.   Lockouts;
4.   War;
5.   National emergencies;
6.   Fire;
7.   Acts of God;
8.   Strikes.
112.76   TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
1.   Grounds for Revocation. The City reserves the right to revoke any
franchise and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise
in the following circumstances:
   A.   If the Grantee should default in the performance of any of its material
obligations under this chapter or the franchise and fails to cure the default
within 60 days after receipt of written notice of the default from the City, or
such longer time as specified by the City.
   B.   If a petition is filed by or against the Grantee under the Bankruptcy
Act or any other insolvency or creditors’ rights law, State or Federal, and the
Grantee shall fail to have it dismissed.
   C.   If a receiver, trustee, or liquidator of the Grantee is applied for or
appointed for all or part of the Grantee’s assets.
   D.   If the Grantee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
   E.   If the Grantee violates any order or ruling of any State or federal
regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Grantee, unless the Grantee or any
party similarly affected is lawfully contesting the legality or applicability
of such order or ruling and has received a stay from a Court of appropriate
jurisdiction.
   F.   If the Grantee evades any of the provisions of this chapter or the
Franchise Agreement.
   G.   If the Grantee practices any intentional fraud or deceit upon the City
or cable subscribers.
   H.   If the Grantee materially misrepresents facts in the application for a
franchise.
   I.   If the Grantee ceases to provide services over the cable system for
seven consecutive days for any reason within the control of the Grantee.
2.   Restoration of Property. In removing its plant, structures, and equipment,
the Grantee shall refill at its own expense any excavation that shall be made
by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that
prevailing prior to the Grantee’s removal of its equipment and appliances,
without affecting the electric or telephone cables, wires, or attachments. The
City shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public
places and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after removal. Liability
insurance indemnity provided in Section
112.63 and the performance bond in Section
112.78 shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal.
3.   Reimbursement of Costs. In the event of a failure by the Grantee to
complete any work as required above or any work required by law or ordinance
within the time established and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City,
after due notice and opportunity to cure, the City may cause such work to be
done and the Grantee shall reimburse the City the costs thereof within 30 days
after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the City may recover such
costs as provided in Section
112.77.
112.77   SECURITY FUND.
1.   Within ten days after execution of the Franchise Agreement, the Grantee
shall deposit with the City Clerk, and maintain on deposit through the term of
the franchise, the sum of $10,000.00 as security for the faithful performance
by it of all the provisions of the franchise and compliance with all orders,
permits, and directions of any agency of the City having jurisdiction over its
acts or defaults under the franchise, and the payment by the Grantee of any
claims, liens, and taxes due the City which arise by reason of the
construction, operation, or maintenance of the system.
2.   Within 10 days after notice that any amount has been withdrawn from the
security fund deposited pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the Grantee
shall pay to, or deposit with, the City Clerk a sum of money sufficient to
restore such security fund to the original amount of $10,000.00.
3.   If the Grantee: (i) fails to pay to the City any compensation within the
time fixed herein; or (ii) fails after ten days’ notice to pay to the City any
taxes due and unpaid; or (iii) fails to repay to the City within such ten days
any damages, costs, or expenses which the City is compelled to pay by reason of
any act or default of the Grantee in connection with the franchise; or (iv)
fails after three days’ notice of such failure by the City to comply with any
provision of the franchise, which the City reasonably determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of the security, the City Clerk may immediately
withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security
fund. Upon such withdrawal, the City Clerk shall notify the company of the
amount and date thereof.
4.   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the
property of the City in the event that the franchise is canceled by reason of
the default of the Grantee. The Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the
return of such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the
expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that there is then no
outstanding default on the part of the Grantee. Interest earned by the
investment of the security fund will accrue to the Grantee.
5.   The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are in
addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by the franchise or
authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with
respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the City may have.
112.78   FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE BOND.
Upon acceptance of a franchise, the Grantee shall submit and maintain
throughout the term of the franchise, a faithful performance bond in the amount
of $100,000.00. The bond shall ensure compliance with all applicable laws,
regulations, ordinances, and provisions of this permit, shall provide for
recoverable loss or damages, compensation, indemnification, reasonable attorney
fees, cost of removal or abandonment of Grantee’s property, and shall cover
penalties of $100.00 per day for failure to meet the construction requirements
of any franchise agreement.
112.79   VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
If the Grantee fails to comply with the requirements of this cable franchise
regulatory ordinance, and a cable franchise agreement, then the City may invoke
and secure compliance in accordance with
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances and as authorized by Section 364.22 of the
Code of Iowa.
112.80   ACTIONS OF PARTIES.
In any action by the City or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under
the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely
manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required
under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
112.81   EQUAL PROTECTION.
In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization,
or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than the
Grantee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of
constructing or operating a cable system or providing cable service to any part
of the service area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably
comparable to those contained herein, in order that one operator not be granted
an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal
protection under the law.
112.82   NOTICES.
Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response
required by a franchise to be served upon the City or the Grantee shall be in
writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party five
business days after having been posted in a properly sealed and correctly
addressed envelope when hand delivered or sent by certified or registered mail,
postage prepaid or express mail service.

This chapter constitutes the Franchise Agreement (the “franchise”) between the
City and Mediacom Iowa LLC, hereinafter referred to as “Grantee.” The City,

operation of a cable system on the terms set forth herein.
113.02   TERM OF FRANCHISE.
The Grantee and its successors and assigns are hereby granted a renewal of
their nonexclusive right, franchise and authority, for a period of 15 years† 7

amplifiers, appliances, attachments, and other related property or equipment as
may be necessary or appurtenant to the cable system, subject to the conditions
and restrictions provided and subject to the provisions of
Chapter 112 of this Code of Ordinances and all applicable law of the State of
Iowa and United States of America. In the event of a transfer and assignment of
the franchise to an entity not controlled by Mediacom Communication

from the date of the assignment unless either: (i) the expiration date of the
full 15-year term is less than three years subsequent to the date of the

conduct a public hearing and shall grant an opportunity to the Grantee to
discuss the proposed increase in franchise fee.

of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five years from the date on

in general of the cutover, using at least two of the following: bill stuffers;
direct mail; news releases; radio announcements; CSR training; and community
bulletin board announcements.

term of the agreement. Operating support shall include wages and benefits,
custodial fees, building maintenance, insurance, utilities, and telephone

and governmental access equipment and facilities in the amount not to exceed
fifty cents ($.50) per subscriber per month for the remaining term of the
franchise payable in the same manner as the franchise fee payment pursuant to
Section
113.05 hereof. The City acknowledges that this amount shall not be considered
gross revenues subject to the payment of franchise fees pursuant to Section
113.05 hereof. Furthermore, payments of this ongoing support shall not be
deemed to be “franchise fees” within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable
Act and such payment shall not be deemed to be “payments-in-kind” or any
involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the City
by the Grantee pursuant to Section
113.05 hereof. The Grantee shall be allowed to collect such fee as a pass-
through to cable subscribers.
113.09   FREE SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
The Grantee shall, upon request, provide without charge one outlet of basic
service and expanded basic cable service to the following public buildings in
the City if such buildings can be serviced with a standard installation from

3.   Police Station   Memorial Hall
4.   Public Library   Eagle Grove High School

The Grantee shall provide a minimum of 69 activated channels on the cable
system as of the effective date of the agreement.
113.11   DISCOUNTED CABLE MODEM INTERNET SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
Grantee shall provide cable modem delivered high-speed Internet service to all
City-owned and operated building in the service area that are provided free
video service under Section
113.09 at a cost no more than 50 percent of the retail rate for such service
provided in similar situated accounts in the service area. The service at each
location will be delivered on one cable modem and shall be capable of providing
Internet service on up to five personal computers at such site. All networking
of such computers using routers and other equipment shall be the responsibility
of the City.
113.12   SERVICE AREA.
Grantee shall offer cable television residential service to all areas of the
City which are in the corporate limits of the City on the effective date of the
franchise subject to the density requirements contained in this section.
Grantee shall, at its expense, promptly extend its system to have service
available to all potential subscribers of:
1.   The corporate limits of the City and newly annexed areas to the City, not
then served by a cable system, where the average density is at least 10
potential subscribers per lineal one-quarter mile of the proposed trunk and
feeder cable route or when service has been extended to such areas by the local
electric service provider.
2.   Any new single-family dwelling unit, commercial establishment, or
potential subscriber within 250 feet of the existing distribution system in the
City, upon request of the potential subscriber.
3.   No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual
circumstances, such as: (i) existence of more than 250 feet of distance from
the distribution cable to the connection point of service to the customers; or
(ii) a density of less than ten potential subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing
strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made available on
the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of
material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of
capital contribution in the aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and
the customers in the area in which service may be expanded, the Grantee will
contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile,
multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences
per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and
whose denominator equals ten potential subscribers. Customers who request
service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs
on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the capital
contribution in aid of the construction borne by such potential customers be
paid in advance.
113.13   TEMPORARY DROPS.
Temporary drops shall be buried within two months of installation, except
during the winter months, which are defined as November 15 to April 1. In the
event that the Grantee fails to bury any cable drops within the two-month
period, the Grantee shall provide Basic and Expanded Basic cable service
without charge to the affected cable subscriber from the last date that the
drop was to have been buried to that actual date that it is buried.
113.14   ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION.
1.   Notice of Violation. In the event that the City believes that the Grantee
has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the Grantee
in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
2.   Grantees’ Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have 30 days from
receipt of the notice described in subsection 1: (i) to respond to the City,
contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such default; or
(iii) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured
within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and
notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will
be completed.
3.   Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in subsection 1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
subsection 2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within
30 days or the date projected pursuant to subsection 2 above, the City shall
schedule a public hearing to investigate the default. The City shall notify the
Grantee in writing of the time and place of such meeting no less than five
business days in advance and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be
heard. The City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the time and place of
such meeting no less than five business days in advance and provide the Grantee
with an opportunity to be heard.
4.   Enforcement. Subject to applicable Federal and State law, and after such
public hearing, the City may determine that the Grantee is in default of any
provision of the franchise and may:
   A.   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;
   B.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief; or
   C.   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked in accordance with the
procedures outlined in this section. The City shall give written notice to the
Grantee of its intent to revoke the franchise on the basis of noncompliance by
the Grantee, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with
a material provision of the franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact
nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall have 90 days from such notice to
object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the
City has not received a response satisfactory from the Grantee, it may then
seek termination of the franchise at a public meeting. The City shall cause to
be served upon the Grantee, at least 10 days prior to such public meeting, a
written notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its
intent to request such termination. At the designated meeting, the City shall
give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after
which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. The
Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have
the power to review the decision of the City de novo and to modify or reverse
such decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must
be taken within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of the City. The
City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems
appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of
revocation of the franchise. Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is
not the City’s intention to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines,
forfeitures, or revocation of the franchise for violations of the franchise
where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal
negative impact on the subscribers within the service area, or where strict
performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the Grantee
which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the City and/or subscribers.
113.15   BONDING REQUIREMENTS.
The Grantee shall provide a performance bond executed in the amount of
$100,000.00 to secure the faithful performance by the Grantee of its
obligations under this Franchise Agreement. This guarantee, however, shall not
limit the liability of the Grantee for any failure to perform its obligations
under this Franchise Agreement.
113.16   FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE.
Consistent with the requirements of
Chapter 112 of this Code of Ordinances, the franchise shall not be construed as
any limitation upon the right of the City to grant to other persons rights,
privileges, or authorities similar to the rights, privileges, and authorities
herein set forth, in the same or other streets, alleys, or other public ways or
public places. The City specifically reserves the right to grant at any time
during the term of the franchise or renewal thereof, if any, such additional
franchises for a cable system as it deems appropriate.
113.17   POLICE POWERS.
In accepting the franchise, Grantee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are
subject to the police powers of the City to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary for the safety and welfare of the public and it agrees to
comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the City
pursuant to such powers.
113.18   TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
The Grantee’s right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee, without
the prior consent of the City. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by
mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or
interest of the Grantee in the franchise in order to secure indebtedness.
Within 30 days of receiving the request for transfer, the City shall in
accordance with FCC rules and regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of the
information it requires to determine the legal, financial, and technical
qualifications of the transferee.
113.19   INSURANCE COVERAGE.
The Grantee shall provide a certificate of insurance designating the City as an
“additional insured.” The Grantee shall maintain and provide to the City proof
of public liability insurance for not less than the following amounts:
   $2,000,000 – Any One Occurrence, Bodily Injury or Property Damage
   $2,000,000 – Products/Completed Operations Annual Aggregate Liability
   $2,000,000 – General Aggregate
113.20   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Grantee shall defend, indemnify, protect, and hold harmless the City from
and against any and all liability, losses, and damage to property or bodily
injury or death to any person, including payments made under worker’s
compensation laws, which may arise out of or be caused by the erection,
construction, replacement, removal, maintenance, or operation of Grantee’s
cable system and caused by any act or failure to act on the part of the
Grantee, its agents, officers, servants, or employees. The City shall give the
Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify within 30 days following
service of a petition or other similar pleading. If the City determines that it
is necessary for it to employ separate counsel, the costs for such separate
counsel shall be the responsibility of the City.
113.21   EQUAL PROTECTION.
In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization,
or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than the
Grantee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of
constructing or operating a cable system or providing cable service to any part
of the service area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably
comparable to those contained herein, in order that one operator not be granted
an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal
protection under the law.

sanctions, other than permitted by the FCC Rules and Regulations, for charging
an unreasonable rate or proposing an unreasonable rate increase.

reviewed only by the FCC.
10.   The City shall be authorized, at any time, whether or not in the course
of a rate regulation proceeding, to gather information as necessary to exercise
its jurisdiction as authorized by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
and the FCC Rules and Regulations. Any information submitted to the City shall
be verified by an appropriate official of the cable television system

response is true and accurate to the best of that person’s knowledge,
information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry.

necessary regulations so as to begin regulating basic service tier cable
television rates and equipment charges.

With regard to the cable programming service tier, as defined by the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the FCC Rules and Regulations, and
over which the City is not empowered to exercise rate regulation, the Cable
Operator shall give notice to the City of any change in rates for the cable
programming service tier or tiers, any change in the charge for equipment
required to receive the tier or tiers, and any changes in the nature of the
services provided, including the program services included in the tier or
tiers. Said notice shall be provided within five (5) business days after the

preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of its residents.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Eagle Grove are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
subsection 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.

Official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Zoning Officer shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the City in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations that
apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
160.04   FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the
following applicable performance standards. Where 100-year flood data has not
been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
1.   All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas
shall:
   A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.

coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
   B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
   C.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
5.   Factory-Built Homes:
   A.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one foot above the
100-year flood level.
   B.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems:
   A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
   B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
   C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply

level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood
elevation.
   D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood
level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or: (i)
not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
floodwaters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as levees,
flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a 100-year flood
with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
9.   Watercourse Alterations or Relocations. Watercourse alterations or
relocations must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
must approve such alterations or relocations.
10.   Subdivision. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the 100-year flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50
lots (whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for those
areas located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
11.   Accessory Structures.
   A.   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures accessory to a
residential use are exempt from the 100-year flood elevation requirements where
the following criteria are satisfied.

3.   Variance.
   A.   The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases
such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      (1)   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (3)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   B.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In passing
upon applications for Variances, the Board shall consider all relevant factors
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
      (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      (6)   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for the area.
      (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      (12)   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      (13)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   C.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      (1)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      (2)   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      (3)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
      (4)   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
      (5)   Flood proofing measures.
160.06   NONCONFORMING USES.

other things, to the character of each district and its peculiar suitability
for particular uses, and with a view of conserving the value of property and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the City.

165.53 shall apply to all zones. In the event of any conflict between two or
more requirements in this chapter or in the City of Eagle Grove Code of
Ordinances relating to landscaping, buffering, or screening, the stricter
provision shall apply.
   A.   Landscaping plans shall be required in the following instances:
      (1)   Any new development or construction, which requires a building
permit or use permit.
      (2)   Any alteration to an existing building or development, which
requires a building or use permit.
      (3)   Any parking lot that is constructed that requires a building
permit.
      (4)   A landscaped berm or buffer in a back yard or side yard shall only
be applied toward the landscape requirement for developments or construction
projects, which require a building permit or use permit, that are directly
adjacent to a different zoning district.
5.   Lot Coverage Requirements. Landscaping shall be calculated based upon the
total developed area of the property. Developed area is defined as that area
within a single contiguous boundary which is made up of structures, parking,
driveways, and docking/loading facilities, or other non-natural elements. There
are two methods for calculating landscape points depending on the zoning
district.
   A.   For all lots except those described in 165.53(5)(B) below, five
landscape points shall be provided for each 300 square feet of developed area.
   B.   For the industrial zoning district, one point shall be provided per 100
square feet of developed area.
The City Council for the City of Eagle Grove shall approve the tabulation of
points and credits via resolution to define the value of each landscape element
for application purposes with prior consideration from the Eagle Grove Parks
and Recreation Board.
6.   Parking Lot Coverage Requirements.
   A.   Properties shall be required to provide a minimum of one square foot of
landscaping for each parking space provided in addition to any other
landscaping required by this section.
   B.   All parking lots in excess of 20 parking spaces shall be required to
have a parking island/directional aisles used for vegetation, delineation, and/
or storm water management.
   C.   All landscaping required by this section shall be located within the
parking lot or directly adjacent to the parking lot.
7.   Additional Requirements. All landscape material and vegetation required by
the provisions of this section shall adhere to the following provisions:
   A.   Only landscaped areas on private property shall count towards the
landscape area required by this section. Landscaping in the dedicated City
right-of-way shall not count towards the required area.
   B.   All landscape material and vegetation shall remain viable and in good
condition at all times. Any material or vegetation that dies or becomes
displaced shall be replaced with similar or like materials or vegetation by
June 1 of the following year.
   C.   All vegetation shall be suitable for Iowa climate and site
characteristics as identified and approved by the City of Eagle Grove Zoning
Official.
   D.   All landscaping shall include a combination of vegetative and landscape
material.
   E.   Grass shall not qualify as landscaping unless planted as part of a
landscape area that includes shrubs, trees, flowers, and/or other landscape
material that meets or exceeds the point requirement.
   F.   No bare ground shall be left exposed. Grass and other appropriate
groundcover or vegetation shall cover all non-paved and non-built areas.
   G.   Landscaping shall not reduce or impair automobile vision, site lines,
or safety.
   H.   All vegetation or landscaping that could cause harm to another
property’s landscape or vegetation material through disease transfer or other
means or impacts the general public’s welfare and safety shall be removed at
the property owner’s expense within seven days of notice by the City of Eagle
Grove Zoning Official.
8.   Variance. If the property owner can not follow these landscape regulations
due to site characteristics, the property owner may request a variance through
the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment may vote to allow the owner to
place a monetary amount equivalent to what would be required to follow this
section in the Eagle Grove Parks and Recreation Fund.
9.   Screening Along District Boundaries. Screening shall be provided along
side and rear property boundaries between different zoning districts. Screening
shall consist of a solid wall, solid fence, or hedge with year-round foliage,
between six and eight feet in height. Height of screening shall be measured
from natural or approved grade.
10.   Screening of Other Site Elements. The following site elements shall be
screened in compatibility with the design elements, materials and colors used
elsewhere on the site, as follows:
   A.   Refuse Disposal Areas. All developments, except single family and two-
family developments, shall provide a refuse disposal area. Such area shall be
screened on four sides (including a gate for access) by a solid, commercial-
grade wood fence, wall, or equivalent material with a minimum height of six
feet and not greater than seven feet unless the refuse disposal area is not
visible.
11.   Maintenance. The property owner of the premises is responsible for the
watering, maintenance, repair and replacement of all landscaping, fences, and
other landscape architectural features on the site. All planting beds shall be
kept weed free. Plant material that has died shall be replaced no later than
the upcoming June 1.
165.54   PERMITS.
There shall be two types of permits: building permits and use permits.
Applicants shall pay a permit fee, to be established from time to time by
resolution of the City Council. Unless otherwise specified, a permit issued
under this section expires 12 months after it has been issued. After the 12-
month period, the permit may be renewed for an additional six months, at no
cost to the permit holder. If the project is not completed after 18 months from
the original permit application date, a new permit must be obtained and current
permit fee paid, in order to continue construction.
1.   Building Permits. A building permit shall be required prior to
construction of any structure and prior to changing the outside dimensions of
any structure. Application for the permit shall be made in writing on forms
available at City Hall. The application form shall be accompanied by a plan
drawn to scale showing the project’s proposed dimensions, proposed drainage and
sewage disposal, and other relevant matters as may be required by the Zoning
Officer. In addition, the plan shall be in ink and shall show the following
elevations related to the centerline of the street.
   A.   Elevations at curb line or edge of traveled way;
   B.   Ditch or waterway bottom and top elevations, where involved;
   C.   Sidewalk elevation, or elevation at street property if no sidewalk
exists;
   D.   Elevation, or elevations, at the ground line at the edge of the
building’s foundation; and
   E.   The first floor elevation.
2.   Use Permits. A use permit shall be required prior to occupying any new
building or land and prior to initiating or changing the use of any existing
building or land. The application for the permit shall be made in writing on a
form provided by City Hall. The application for a use permit shall be combined
with the application for a building permit where applicable.
165.55   INTERPRETATION.
In the interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be
held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health,
safety, morals, and general welfare. Such provisions are intended, among other
purposes, to provide for adequate light, air, and convenience of access; to
lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire and other dangers;
to avoid undue concentration of population by regulating and limiting the
height and bulk of buildings wherever erected; to limit and determine the size
of yards, courts, and other open spaces; to regulate the density of population;
all with reasonable consideration to the character of the district and its
peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the
value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout
the City.

agreement shall further provide that the owner-developer will file restrictive
covenants as part of the subdivision procedure, which covenants contain such
restrictions on the construction of such other improvements. The agreement
shall be drafted at the owner-developer’s expense and must be approved and
signed by the City. If the owner-developer is to receive financial assistance
of any type from the City, then the agreement will provide that the City will
not give the assistance until the grading of streets and installation of the
required utility improvements within the platted area are completed. The
agreement shall further provide that if the owner-developer has not pre-sold at
least 25 percent of the subdivision’s lots or a minimum of four lots, whichever
is greater, within three years after the City has extended the utilities to the
