                             Premises
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating
to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge which a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of eighteen
(18) years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six (6) hours without the oral or written order of a judge
or magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which
are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
   2.   Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon
any of the alleys, streets or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of:
      A.   11:00 p.m. on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday

or before the beginning of the activity;
         (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or
meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious
or cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
      D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,

vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police

surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.

(Ord. 333 – Apr. 16 Supp.)
   6.   Water Budget Billing.
      A.   A utility customer in good standing may request the City to enter
into a budget billing payment plan. The budget billing monthly amount will be
the annual average utility cost divided by twelve to create a monthly budget
billing payment. At the end of the budget billing year, the surplus or deficit
of the budget billing payments to the actual usage cost will be provided in
writing to the budget billing customer, as well as a new proposed budget
billing monthly payment amount. The budget billing customer with a surplus will
be issued a refund for the surplus, unless the customer contacts the City in
writing to request that the surplus be applied to future bills. The budget
billing customer with a deficit of $200.00 or more will be asked to pay the
deficit. The budget billing customer with a deficit of less than $200.00 will
have the deficit added to their budget billing payment over the next year. In
no way does the choice of budget billing eliminate or reduce the water utility
customer’s responsibility to pay their bill in full at or by termination of
utility service.
      B.   If a customer has not had a twelve month history of water usage in
their current residence, the City may figure a budget billing payment amount
taking into account the past annual usage at that residence, past annual usage
of that family at another residence, the number of persons residing in the
household, the Citywide average usage for that number of persons per household,
and any additional factors such as swimming pools, etc. which would make a
change in expected usage likely. Except for the initial calculation of budget
billing amounts, annual recalculations of budget billing amounts will be made
in February or August of each year. Thereafter annual recalculations will be
done in August of each year.
      C.   If a customer on budget billing fails to pay their budget billing
payment amount twice within one budget billing year, the customer will be
billed for actual usage, until the customer again has a six month current bill
payment history.
      D.   If a customer who was on budget billing but failed to pay the budget
billing payment amount when due, has a balance due, the customer may negotiate
payment of the past due payment in up to three monthly installments. The past
due budget billing installment shall be paid with the regular monthly budget
billing payment. If the budget billing customer is delinquent, without an
arranged payment plan, the customer’s utility shall be shut off as described in
this section. The shut-off customer must again be in good standing and paid
current for three months before reinstatement to budget billing. Determinations
by the Clerk as to modifications, continuation or return to monthly billing may
be appealed to the City Council by written request of the utility customer and
will be heard at the next available Council meeting. The Clerk’s decision shall
be carried out unless and until modified after appeal by the City Council.
   7.   Budget Billing and Emergency. When a utility customer has a water leak,
or other unusual spike in their recorded usage of a utility and is on budget
billing, the City shall contact the utility customer and attempt to resolve the
situation to reduce the usage to a normal level. Despite the budget billing
payment plan arrangement, the utility customer is responsible for immediate
payment for spikes in usage of utility service which, for the period of the
spike, exceeding the normal usage by 20%. The next utility bill will reflect
actual cost for the period of the additional actual usage, calculated at the
current rate. The utility customer may negotiate a payment plan for the spike
of payments of the additional, above budget amount over the course of three
bill payments.
(Ord. 314 – Dec. 13 Supp.)
   8.   Refunds of Current Deposits on Hand. Water, sewer, and garbage deposits
shall be refunded to the existing utility customer, provided that the
customer’s door has not been posted for disconnection within the past twelve
months.
(Ord. 338 – Apr. 16 Supp.)
92.09   NON-REFUNDABLE HOOK-UP AND SERVICE FEE.
There shall be required from every new account customer of water and sewer
utility a non-refundable hook-up fee of $300.00. Such fee shall be reduced to
$150.00 if the new account customer will provide a copy of their Social
Security Card, or Federal Tax Identification letter, if an entity and Iowa
Driver’s License or Iowa State-issued Identification Card for the primary
account holder, or an owner or manager of an entity. That current customers who
are changing their residence within the City of Moulton to be a continuing
Moulton utility customer, without lapse of service, shall pay a non-refundable
hook-up fee of $50.00.
(Ord. 338 – Apr. 16 Supp.)
92.10   PARTIAL MONTH WATER BILLING.
   1.   For customers receiving their final bill for voluntary disconnection of
service and customers in their first partial month of service, the water bills
of water utility customers will be prorated for persons who do not have service
for the entire billing period as follows:
      A.   The minimum water bill is as set by Section
92.02 herein, (now at $36.00), based on a minimum usage of 2,000 (two thousand)
gallons within the service period. If the utility customer’s usage for the
service period meets or exceeds 2,000 gallons, there will be no proration, and
the customer will be billed their actual water usage.   
(Paragraph A – Ord. 374 – Jul. 25 Supp.)
      B.   For the water utility customer who does not have water service for
the whole period, whose water usage for the partial billing period does not
meet or exceed 2000 gallon, the customer will be charged a per diem rate for
the days for which the customer has service. The per diem rate will be the
minimum monthly charge (see Section
92.02), divided by the number of days in the service period (which varies), and
then multiplied by the number of days for which the customer had service. The
service period varies and depends on the dates that the meters are read each
month and the number of days between those meter readings.
   2.   Nothing in this section shall restrict the Council from modifying the
minimum water service usage rate, as permitted by this chapter. Changing such
rates, as permitted by ordinance, shall not otherwise invalidate this policy.
Where such minimum rates are modified by the Council, absent further action by
the Council, the new minimum rates shall be substituted into the policy for the
existing rates, as applicable, without further amendment of this ordinance.
Absent gross mistake, the records of the City as to usage, service days, and
billing period, and the results produced by the City’s computer billing program
will be final. Customers concerned about a gross mistake may request to be
heard at the next City Council meeting.

be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   3.   Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to
the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code,
applicable rules and regulations of the City, or the procedures set forth in
A.S.T.M. Specification C-12. All such connections shall be made gastight and
watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be
approved by the Superintendent before installation.
   4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least ten
(10) feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be
less, provided the water service line is located at one side and at least
twelve (12) inches above the top of the building sewer.
   5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four (4) inches.

   12.   Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six (6)
inches on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall
rest on firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary

impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a “Y” saddle shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued and attached with stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no time shall a
building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless special written
permission is received from the Superintendent and in accordance with the
Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid under ground shall be covered or trenches filled until after

flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s
are determined from periodic grab samples).

(Ord. 356 – Sep. 21 Supp.)
99.03   SURCHARGES.
For those customers who contribute wastewater of strength greater than normal
domestic sewage, a surcharge will be collected in addition to the sewer user
charge. “Normal domestic sewage” means wastewater that has a BOD concentration
of not more than 170 mg/l and a suspended solids (SS) concentration of not more
than 200 mg/l. The surcharge for operation, maintenance and replacement is:
      $0.17 per pound BOD
      $0.14 per pound SS
(Appendices A and B, showing the determination of the sewer use charges, are
included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances.)
99.04   ADDITIONAL CHARGES.
Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the wastewater treatment
works, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by
interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of
operation, maintenance or replacement of the wastewater treatment works, shall
pay for such increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be as
determined by the Council.
99.05   APPLICATION.
The user charge rates established in this chapter apply to all users,
regardless of their location, of the wastewater treatment works.
99.06   PAYMENT OF BILLS.

92.04 if the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions
contained in Section
92.07 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent
account.
99.07   LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
Except as provided for in Section
92.06 of this Code of Ordinances, the owner of the premises served and any
lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for sewer

If a customer has been disconnected from utility service for nonpayment of a
bill, the customer shall be charged an additional deposit amount. The
additional deposit amount due from the disconnected customer shall be such sum
which, when combined with any already held deposit for that City utility, shall
equal the sum which would have been required if the customer were a new
customer. If the utility requires an additional deposit from an existing
customer, it shall contact the customer by written notice, mailed to the
customer’s last known address. The customer shall have no less than twelve (12)
days from the date of mailing to pay the additional deposit in full. The notice
of additional deposit shall contain information that the customer has the right
to make a written appeal of such additional deposit determination to the City
Council. The written appeal, if any, must also be made to the City Clerk within
the same twelve (12) days from the date of mailing of the notice informing the
customer of the additional utility deposit required. Upon appeal, the Clerk
shall suspend collection of the additional utility deposit pending decision by
the City Council. Upon appeal, the City Council may in their discretion, make a
payment arrangement with the disconnected utility customer, which upon
compliance with the additional deposit payment plan, may give additional time
to the utility customer to pay the full deposit. In no case shall the Council
extend the time for payment of the full deposit past three months from the date
of disconnection. The City Clerk is authorized to act to collect the additional
utility deposit according to the additional deposit payment plan authorized by
the City Council. No written notice is required to be given for setting up a
customer with initial service.
(Ord. 324 – May 15 Supp.)
99.09   SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.
No statement in these chapters shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement or contract between the Council, and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rate and cost as established by the
Council.
99.10   REVIEW OF USER CHARGE SYSTEM.
The City will review the user charge system at least every two (2) years and
revise user charge rates as necessary to ensure that the system generates
adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation, maintenance and replacement
and that the system continues to provide for the proportional distribution of
operation, maintenance and replacement costs among users. The City will notify
each user at least annually, in conjunction with a regular billing, of the rate
being charged for operation, maintenance and replacement of the treatment
works.
99.11   PARTIAL MONTH SEWER BILLING.
   1.   For customers receiving their final bill for voluntary disconnection of
service and customers in their first partial month of service, the sewer bills
of sewer utility customers will be prorated for persons who do not have service
for the entire billing period as follows:
      A.   The minimum monthly sewer bill is as set by Section
99.02 herein, (now at $21.84), is based on the water usage, a minimum usage of
2000 (two thousand) gallons of water used within the service period. If the
sewer utility customer’s water usage for the service period meets or exceeds
2000 gallons, there will be no proration, and the customer will be billed their
actual sewer usage, as described in Sections 99.20 and
99.03 herein.
      B.   For the sewer utility customer who does not have sewer service for
the whole period, whose water usage for the partial billing period does not
meet or exceed 2000 gallon, the customer will be charged a per diem rate for
the days for which the customer has sewer service. The per diem rate will be
the minimum monthly charge (see Section
99.02), divided by the number of days in the service period (which varies), and
then multiplied by the number of days for which the customer had service. The
service period varies and depends on the dates that the meters are read each
month and the number of days between those meter readings.
   2.   Nothing in this section shall restrict the Council from modifying the
minimum sewer service usage rate, as permitted by this chapter. Changing such
rates, as permitted by ordinance, shall not otherwise invalidate this policy.
Where such minimum rates are modified by the Council, absent further action by
the Council, the new minimum rates shall be substituted into the policy for the
existing rates, as applicable, without further amendment of this ordinance.
Absent gross mistake, the records of the City as to usage, service days, and
billing period, and the results produced by the City’s computer billing program
will be final. Customers concerned about a gross mistake may request to be
heard at the next City Council meeting.

customer of the additional utility deposit required. Upon appeal, the Clerk
shall suspend collection of the additional utility deposit pending decision by
the City Council. Upon appeal, the City Council may in their discretion, make a
payment arrangement with the disconnected utility customer, which upon
compliance with the additional deposit payment plan, may give additional time
to the utility customer to pay the full deposit. In no case shall the Council

resolution of the Council which resolution shall be set out in the published
proceedings of the Council.
110.07   LOCATION OF METERS.
All meters shall be so located that they are easily accessible to meter readers
and repairmen. There shall be no obstructions or animals barring the meter
reader and/or repairmen’s access to said meter. Any gates must be left unlocked
and free from any restrictions. Any violation of this section shall result in a
fine of up to $500.00 and/or the shutoff of the utilities.
110.08    GAS DEPOSITS.
All customers of any utility service managed by the City of Moulton shall have
on file with the City of Moulton a deposit of roughly one month’s service, at
the highest usage in the past year during which someone lived in the residence,
with the current gas rate and multiplier, at the time the deposit is
calculated. Deposits will be paid in full before the customer receives service.
(Ord. 316 – Dec-13 Supp.)
110.09    REFUND OF GAS DEPOSITS.
The deposit for gas, shall be refunded after twelve consecutive months of
prompt payment (which may be 11 timely payments and one automatic forgiveness
of late payments), unless the utility is entitled to require a new or
additional deposit for good cause determined by the utility upon reasonable
written notice. Such written notice shall be mailed to the customer’s last
mailing address. The customer shall have no less than twelve days from the date
of mailing to provide the new or additional deposit. No such written notice is
required prior to establishing a new customer’s service.
110.10    RECEIPT.
The utility shall issue a receipt of deposit to each customer from whom a

(if different) the amount and date of deposit. It is the customer’s burden to
prove a utility deposit, if different from the log book.
110.11    RETURN OF DEPOSIT AFTER TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
The utility shall make reasonable efforts to return unclaimed deposits, less

A disconnect fee shall be charged when service is disconnected by the City for
nonpayment of utility charges by a delinquent customer. A reconnect fee shall
be charged before service is restored to a customer who has remedied the
delinquency. Such fees shall be set by the Council by resolution of the
Council, and shall be kept of record available to the public at City Hall, City
of Moulton.
110.13    BUDGET BILLING.
   1.   When a utility customer has a history of timely payment of the combined
utility bill for a period of six months, that customer may request the City to
enter into a budget billing payment plan. The budget billing monthly amount
will be the annual average gas utility cost divided by twelve to create a
monthly budget billing payment. At the end of the budget billing year, the
surplus or deficit of the budget billing payments to the actual usage cost will
be provided in writing to the budget billing customer, as well as a new
proposed budget billing monthly payment amount. The budget billing customer
with a surplus will be issued a refund for the surplus, unless the customer
contacts the City in writing to request that the surplus be applied to future
bills. The budget billing customer with a deficit of $200.00 or more will be
asked to pay the deficit. The budget billing customer with a deficit of less
than $200.00 will have the deficit added to their budget billing payment over
the next year. In no way does the choice of budget billing eliminate or reduce
the gas utility customer’s responsibility to pay their bill in full at or by
termination of utility service.
   2.   If a customer has not had a twelve month history of gas usage in their
current residence, the City may figure a budget billing payment amount taking
into account the past annual usage at that residence, past annual usage of that
family at another residence, the number of persons residing in the household,
the Citywide average usage for that number of persons per household, and any
additional factors such as fireplaces, etc. which would make a change in
expected usage likely. Except for the initial calculation of budget billing
amounts, annual recalculations of budget billing amounts will be made in August
of each year.
   3.   If a customer on budget billing fails to pay their budget billing
payment amount twice within one budget billing year, the customer will be
billed for actual usage, until the customer again has a six month current bill
payment history.
   4.   Determinations by the Clerk as to modifications, continuation or return
to monthly billing may be appealed to the City Council by written request of
the utility customer and will be heard at the next available Council meeting.
The Clerk’s decision shall be carried out unless and until modified after
appeal by the City Council.

112.01   TITLE.
This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the “Broadband
Communications Ordinance, 1998.” No person shall construct, operate or maintain
any Broadband Communications system upon, over, under, along, across or above
any public way, road, street, alley or sidewalk or other public property except
under this or a subsequent ordinance of the City.
112.02   DEFINITIONS.
The following terms and phrases are defined for use in this chapter:
   1.   “Broadband Communications System” or “system” means the system of
antennas, towers, satellite earth stations, microwave, coaxial cable, fiber
optics, waveguides, or other conductors, converters, equipment and facilities
designed and constructed for the purpose of producing, receiving, transmitting,
amplifying and distributing audio, video, digital and other forms of electronic
and electrical signals to persons who subscribe to programs and services
delivered by such signals. Said definition shall not include any such facility
that serves only subscribers in one or more multiple unit dwellings under
common ownership, control or management, and does not use City rights-of-way.
   2.   “Grantee” or “operator” is NewPath Communications, a corporation, and
it is the grantee of rights under the franchise. Grantee will, during the term
hereof and any extension of the franchise, retain its lawful status to do
business under the laws of and in the State of Iowa, and remain solvent and not
in receivership.
   3.   “Proposal” is the same as “application.”
112.03   PROVISION OF SERVICES; CONTINUING OBLIGATION.
The Grantee shall provide services, technical standards and system design
specifically set forth in its proposal to provide broadband communication
service within the City, and by its acceptance of the franchise, the Grantee
specifically grants and agrees that its proposal is hereby incorporated by
reference and made a part of this chapter.
112.04   GRANT OF AUTHORITY.
   1.   There is hereby granted to the Grantee the nonexclusive right and
privilege to construct, erect, operate and maintain in, upon, along, across,
above, over and under the streets, alleys, public utility easements, public
ways and public places now laid out or dedicated, and all extensions thereto in
the City, according to the technical specifications of the Federal
Communications Commission, all poles, wires, cables, underground conduits,
manholes and other conductors and fixtures necessary for the transmission of
communication signals and all other signals permitted by the Federal
Communications Commission or its successor agency, either separately or upon or
in conjunction with any public utility maintaining the same in the City, with
all of the necessary and desirable appliances and appurtenances pertaining
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this franchise and
grant shall and does hereby include the right in, over, under and upon the
streets, sidewalks, alleys, public utility easements and public grounds and
places in the City to install, erect, operate or in any way acquire the use of,
as by leasing or licensing, all lines and equipment necessary to a broadband
communication system and the right to make connections to subscribers and the
right to repair, replace, enlarge and extend said lines, equipment and
connections. Grantee shall have authority to trim trees that overhang the
public right-of-way only when absolutely necessary and then in a good and
workmanlike manner. This franchise and grant includes the right to use public
property which shall have been acquired by the City in the future as well as
public property currently owned by it, upon approval being granted by the
Council.
   2.   The above grant to Grantee shall include the right to offer broadband
communication service to residents within the present boundaries of the City as
those boundaries may change from time to time by annexation or otherwise.
Whenever the Company receives a request for service from at least ten (10)
single-family residence connections within one thousand five hundred (1,500)
feet of its distribution cable, it shall extend the system to such subscribers
at no cost to the subscribers other than the usual connection and service fees
for all subscribers, provided that such system extension is technically and
physically feasible. Measurement of the general density standard for service to
any area shall be from the closest existing point of the Company’s system. No
person in the Company’s service area shall be arbitrarily refused service.
However, in unusual circumstances, such as a requirement for underground cable
that requires rock saw or service to subscribers of a density of less than 10
single-family residences per 1,500 feet of distribution cable, in order that
the existing subscribers shall not be unfairly burdened, service may be made
available on the basis of a capital contribution by the prospective subscribers
to the Company, including reimbursement for the Company’s cost of materials,
labor and easements.
112.05   TERM.
The franchise shall be effective from and after the effective date of the
franchise and shall remain in full force and effect for a period of five (5)
years upon payment of the annual fee and tax as hereinafter provided and the
Grantee shall have a right or option to negotiate the terms of the lease for an
additional five years with an option of five years after the expiration of the
primary term under the same terms and provisions except that the sum paid by
the Grantee for yearly street rental shall be subject to re-negotiation at the
expiration of the primary term between the parties.† 7

  City, was passed and adopted on February 2, 1998. Ordinance No. 207, renewing the
7 franchise and providing for an expiration date of February 2, 2013, was adopted on
  April 7, 2008.
   
112.06   POLICE POWER.
At all times during the term of the franchise, Grantee shall be subject to all
lawful exercise of the police power of the City. The right is hereby reserved
to the City to adopt, in addition to the provisions herein contained and any
other existing applicable ordinances, such additional applicable ordinances as
it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police power; provided, however,
such additional ordinances shall be reasonable, shall not conflict with or
substantially alter the rights granted herein, and shall not conflict with the
laws of the State of Iowa, the laws of the United States of America, or the
rules, regulations and policies of the Federal Communications Commission.
112.07   LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE.
   1.   Damages. The Grantee shall pay, and by its acceptance of this
authority, does specifically agree that it will pay all damages and penalties
which the City legally may be required to pay as a result of granting the
franchise. These damages or penalties shall include, but shall not be limited
to: damages arising out of copyright infringement, defamation, unauthorized
taking, antitrust and royalty payments; any and all damages, including personal
injury, death and property damages, arising out of the installation, operation
or maintenance of the system authorized hereby. Provided, however, this
indemnification does not extend to causes of actions arising solely from the
actions of the City, its officers and employees and for which Grantee has no

City, its officers and employees and for which Grantee has no responsibility.
These expenses include all out-of-pocket expenses, such as attorney fees,
providing Grantee shall have exclusive right to retain counsel of its choice,
and shall include also the reasonable value of any services rendered by the
City Attorney or assistants or any employees of the City.
   3.   Insurance. Grantee shall maintain, and by acceptance hereof
specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the term of this
authority and grant, liability insurance insuring the Grantee and the City (the

112.08   GENERAL CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   1.   All system facilities shall be installed, repaired and replaced by
Grantee, or by someone in its behalf, and Grantee shall be solely responsible
for and shall pay the expenses thereof, including the cost of promptly
restoring the surface of any street, alley, other public way or any point of
excavation, whether on public or private property. All such facilities erected,
constructed or replaced by the Grantee within the City, including extensions of
streets, alleys and other public ways and places, shall be erected so as to
cause no interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of users or
property owners whose property adjoins any of said streets, alleys, or public
ways and places, and so as not to interfere with existing public utility
installations or extensions thereof, or repair to either. All service lines
shall be underground in those areas of the City where either public utilities
providing telephone or electric utility facilities are underground at the time
of installation; otherwise the Grantee may install its services above ground.
If, subsequently, the electric utility facilities go underground, then in that
event the facilities of the Grantee also shall go underground simultaneously
and Grantee shall pay for the costs of the same. The grant of authority
hereunder includes the right of the Grantee to cut and trim trees to protect
its facilities and Grantee shall pay for the costs of the same. Grantee accepts
all legal and economic responsibility for actions taken to protect its system,
including the cutting and trimming of trees.
   2.   Grantee shall have the right to make underground cable installations on
property of the City consistent with existing underground installations for
other utilities, and the City will make appropriate grants of easement to
Grantee in such cases. Grantee shall advise the City in advance of any
excavation to be performed by Grantee. Grantee shall make no installation of
poles on or adjacent to any public way or public property without the consent
of the City.
   3.   During the term of the franchise, Grantee shall be responsible for all
costs of moving any portions of the system in the event the City finds that the
public needs require changes in the location or use of any public property,
including streets, grades and curbs and sewer and water mains.
   4.   Grantee may be required by the City to permit joint use by utilities of
Grantee’s system facilities located in the streets, alleys or other public
right-of-way in the City insofar as such joint use reasonably may be
practicable, and upon payment of reasonable rental therefor.
   5.   Grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a
manner consistent with all Federal, State, County and City laws, ordinances,
construction standards and governmental requirements, and with technical
standards of the Federal Communications Commission. In addition, Grantee shall
provide the City, upon request, with a written report of the results of
Grantee’s proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to the Federal
Communications Commission standards and requirements.
   6.   Construction, installation and maintenance of the Grantee’s system
shall be accomplished in an orderly workmanlike manner. All cables and wires
shall be installed parallel with electric and telephone lines, where
practicable. Multiple cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel and
shall be bundled with due respect for engineering considerations. Grantee shall
provide the City with reports, every three (3) months during construction, of
the progress made in constructing and activating the system.
   7.   The system shall not endanger or interfere with the safety of persons
or property in the franchise area, or in other areas in which Grantee may have
equipment activated or situated.
   8.   Any antenna structure used in the system shall comply with
construction, marking and lighting of antenna structures, as may be required by
the United States Department of Transportation.

services to prove no interference signal combinations are possible. Stray
radiation shall be measured adjacent to any proposed aeronautical navigation
radio sites to prove no interference to airborne navigational reception in the
normal flight patterns. Federal rules and regulations shall govern.
   11.   Tests and measurements to insure compliance with technical standards
shall be performed by the Grantee, in a manner that is consistent with the
provisions and standards of the Federal Communications Commission, as amended
from time to time. Results of all tests and measurements required to be taken
by the Grantee shall be recorded, maintained and made available to the City
upon request. Where there exists evidence which, in the judgment of the
Council, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the City
shall have the right to require Grantee to perform tests and analyses directed
toward such suspected inadequacies. Grantee shall fully cooperate with the City
in performing such testing, and shall prepare results and a report, if
requested, within thirty days after notice. Such report shall include the
following information: the nature of the complaint or problem which
precipitated the special tests; what system components were tested; equipment
used and procedure employed in testing; the method, if any, in which such
complaint or problem was resolved; and any other information pertinent to said
tests and analyses which may be required. The City may require that tests be
supervised, at Grantee’s expense, by a licensed professional engineer. The
engineer shall certify all records of special tests and forward to the City
such records with a report interpreting the results thereof and recommending
actions to be taken, if any. The City’s right pursuant hereto shall be limited
to requiring tests, analyses and reports pertaining to specific subjects and
characteristics based on complaints or sufficient evidence which the City has
grounds to believe will require testing to be performed to protect the public
against substandard cable service. In the event that the supervising engineer
reports that action is necessary on the part of the Grantee, the Grantee will
take such action within seven (7) days of notice thereof.
   12.   Grantee shall put, keep and maintain all parts of the system in good
condition throughout the entire period of the franchise. Grantee shall render
efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good
cause and for the shortest time possible.
   13.   Grantee shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere
with television reception of persons not served by Grantee, nor shall the
system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner the operation of the
various utilities serving the residents within the confines of the City.
   14.   Grantee shall maintain at a minimum, throughout the lifetime of the
franchise, the technical standards and quality of said service set forth by
Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations and Grantee will at its
sole expense update and improve its system. The standard for determining
quality and equipment will be based upon service and equipment which is
technologically and economically reasonable and, to a lesser extent, based upon
service and equipment provided to similar sized communities by unrelated cable
companies in similar circumstances.
   15.   Grantee shall produce a picture, whether in black and white or in
color, accompanied with proper sound on typical standard production television
sets in good repair, that is as good as the Federal Communications Commission
technical rules require. Grantee shall limit failures to a minimum by locating
and correcting malfunctions promptly, but in no event longer than three (3)
days after written notice by the City to Grantee unless the failure is beyond
the control of the Grantee.

installations are involved, the City will not be responsible for damage to such
underground facilities until the maps and plans of the system, in the hands of
the City, have been updated to show such underground installations. Maps and
plans provided to the City shall be at the expense of the Grantee.
   3.   Technical Standards. The cable communications system will be designed,

renewal.
   4.   Unless otherwise agreed upon, any amended cable ordinance or provision
thereunder adopted before the franchise renewal shall take effect at the
franchise renewal.
   5.   When the City approves a franchise renewal, the Grantee shall accept
the renewed franchise under the procedures set out in Section
112.21.

Forty-five (45) days following the adoption of a resolution by the Council
determining a failure of Grantee to comply with the construction, operational
or maintenance standards, contained herein, Grantee shall pay to the City

The Council shall inspect or cause to be inspected any trees or shrubs in the
