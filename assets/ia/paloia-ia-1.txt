Should the United States Geological Survey lack federal funding to continue to
operate and maintain the sreamgaging station on the Cedar River at Blairs Ferry
Road, the Council shall review and consider the financial and practical
feasibility of operating and maintaining the sreamgaging station without such
federal funding.
37.04Â Â Â OTHER STATIONS.
Should the United States Geological Survey propose additional streamgaging
stations that would provide valuable data to the City, the Council shall review
and consider the proposal and make every effort to jointly fund the operation
and maintenance of such additional stations.

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.236[1])
1.Â Â Â Residential or Business District. Excepting only when such vehicles are

person shall park or leave unattended such vehicle on any streets within the

will not interfere with other traffic.
2.Â Â Â Noise. No such vehicle shall be left standing or parked upon any street,
alley, public or private parking lot, or drive of any service station between

3.Â Â Â Livestock. No such vehicle containing livestock shall be parked on any
street, alley, or highway for a period of time of more than 30 minutes.
69.10Â Â Â SNOW EMERGENCY.
1.Â Â Â Snow plowing or ice control operations shall commence under the direction
of the Maintenance Supervisor. The Maintenance Supervisor will confer with City
staff to determine when and where operations will begin in accordance with the
following criteria:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Snow accumulation of two inches or more.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Drifting of snow that causes problems for travel;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Icy conditions which seriously affect travel; and
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Time of snowfall in relationship to heavy use of streets (i.e., weekday
morning and afternoon commuter periods).
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Snow and ice control operations are expensive and involve the use of
limited personnel and equipment. Consequently snowplowing operations will not
generally be conducted for snowfall of less than two inches.
2.Â Â Â Snow Emergency Alternate Side Parking. Upon declaration of a snow
emergency, vehicles which are parked on public streets shall comply with the
following: vehicles parking on public streets shall only be permitted on the
side of the street with even numbered addresses on even numbered calendar days
or odd numbered addresses on odd numbered calendar days.
3.Â Â Â Snow Plowing Procedures. Snow will be plowed in a manner so as to provide
access as soon as possible and to minimize any traffic obstructions. The center
of streets will be plowed first. The snow shall then be pushed from left to
right. The discharge shall go onto the parking portion of the right-of-way.
Streets and cul-de-sacs are initially plowed with a single pass to open all
routes as soon as possible. It is the Cityâ€™s goal to have the entire street
system cleaned after a â€œtypicalâ€ snowfall in approximately 24 hours. Depending
on snowfall conditions and duration of the storm, streets will not always
immediately be able to be completely cleared of snow.
4.Â Â Â Suspension of Operations. Generally, operations will continue until all
routes are passable. Widening and cleanup operations may continue immediately
or on the following work day, depending on conditions and circumstances. Safety
of the plow operators and the public is important. Therefore, snow plowing and
removal operations may be terminated after 10 to 12 hours to allow personnel
adequate time for rest. There may be instances where this is not possible,
depending on storm conditions and other circumstances. Operations may also be
suspended during periods of limited visibility, significant winds, or severe
cold so as to not jeopardize the safety of City employees and equipment. Any
decision to suspend operations shall be made by the Maintenance Supervisor
based on the conditions of the storm. The City will still provide access for
emergency fire, police, and medical services on an â€œas-neededâ€ basis during a
major snow or ice storm.
5.Â Â Â Use of Sand and Salt. The City is concerned about the effect of salt and
sand on the environment and will limit its use for that reason. Therefore, it
is the policy of the City to utilize salt and sand at locations where there are
hazardous or slippery conditions. This provides for traction but is not
intended to provide bare pavement during winter conditions. The City will not
be responsible for damage to grass caused by salt and sand and therefore will
not make repairs or compensate residents for salt and sand damage to turf areas
in the right-of-way.
6.Â Â Â Property Damage. Snow plowing and ice control operations can cause
property damage even under the best of circumstances and care on the part of
the operators. The major types of damage are to improvements in the City right-
of-way, which may extend approximately 10 to 15 feet beyond the edge of the
street. The intent of the right-of-way is to provide room for snow storage,
utilities and other City uses. However, certain private improvements such as
mailboxes, landscaping and other private installations are located within this
area.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Mailboxes. Mailboxes should be constructed sturdily enough to withstand
snow rolling off a plow or wing. While the installation of mailboxes on the
City right-of-way is permitted, the mailbox owner assumes all risk of damage
except when a mailbox is damaged through contact by a plow blade, wing, or
other piece of equipment. If a mailbox is damaged due to direct contact by snow
plowing equipment, the City, at its option, will repair or replace the mailbox
at a cost not to exceed $50.00. Damage resulting from snow rolling off a plow
or wing is the responsibility of the resident.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Landscaping. Property owners shall assume all risk of damage for
landscaping, including nursery and inanimate materials that are installed in or
encroach on City right-of- way. The City assumes no responsibility for damage
incurred to these non-permitted elements as a result of snow plowing and ice
control activities. In addition, inanimate materials such as boulders, timbers,
etc. are hazards and can cause damage to plow equipment and therefore are
strictly prohibited.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Other Private Installations. The City will assume no responsibility for
underground lawn sprinkling systems, exterior lighting systems, underground
electronic dog fences or any other non-permitted features privately installed
in City right-of-way.
7.Â Â Â Snow Storage/Wing Plowing. Ongoing snow and ice control efforts require
the use of the entire City right-of-way and easement areas for storage of
plowed snow. Depending on the volume of snow, available storage within the
right-of way can become limited and/or create sight obstructions. Since it is
financially impossible and impractical to remove snow from all boulevards and
intersection corners, the City, at the Maintenance Supervisorâ€™s direction, will
â€œwing plowâ€ snowbanks along the right-of-way. This winging operation results in
snow being pushed father back onto the right-of-way area.
8.Â Â Â Driveways. One of the most frequent and most irritable problems in removal
of snow from the public streets is the snow deposited in driveways during
plowing operations. Snow that accumulates on the plow blade has no place to go
but in the driveway. Snowplow operators make every attempt to minimize the
amount of snow deposited in driveways, but the snow can still be significant.
Based on the priorities and staffing level, City personnel do not provide
driveway cleaning, except for emergency situations as determined by the
Maintenance Supervisor.
9.Â Â Â Mail Delivery. Snowplow operators make every effort to remove snow as
close to the curb line as practical and to provide access to mailboxes for the
Postal Department. However, it is not possible to provide perfect conditions
and minimize the damage to mailboxes with the size and type of equipment the
City operates. Therefore, the final cleaning adjacent to mailboxes is the
responsibility of each resident.
10.Â Â Â Complaints. Complaints regarding snow and ice removal or damage will be
taken during normal working hours and handled in accordance with the Cityâ€™s
complaint procedures.
69.11Â Â Â SNOW ROUTES.
The Council may designate certain streets in the City as snow routes. When
conditions of snow or ice exist on the traffic surface of a designated snow
route, it is unlawful for the driver of a vehicle to impede or block traffic.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.236[12])

Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Side Yard Corner Lots. Shall mean the yard area adjacent to the street
right-of-way on a corner lot extending from the front yard along the side of
the structure to the rear property line.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Side Yard. Shall mean the yard area adjacent to the residential
structure, but not adjacent to the street right-of-way, extending from the

outside parking and storage of vehicles on property used for residential
purposes and/or on residentially zoned property unless it complies with the
following requirements:
Front Yard or Side Yard, Corner Lots. Vehicles which are parked or stored
outside in any front yard, or any side yard of corner lot areas must be on an
all-weather surface driveway which shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the
front yard of any lot or the side yard of a corner lot. Driveways exceeding
forty percent (40%) of the front yard of any lot or the side yard of a corner
lot prior to the adoption of this section are exempt provided no additional
surface area is added. This provision, however, shall not prevent the
construction of hard surface paving to access the garage(s) for multiple
attached dwellings, provided the design is approved by City building officials.
Â Â Â Exceptions. During emergency snow removal operations (when snow ordinance is
in effect), vehicles may be parked in a manner whereas the entire vehicle may
be parked in any portion of a residentially zoned property or any property used
for residential purposes. Said vehicles must then be moved to normal parking
(all-weather surface) within twenty-four (24) hours following the cancellation
of the snow ordinance.
Side Yards. Parking of all vehicles, including licensed and operable vehicles,
must be parked in a permanent roofed structure or on an all-weather surface

connected to a driveway leading from an approved curb drop or entrance which
also consists of an all-weather surface. The vehicle wheels and any component
touching the ground must be located entirely on, and directly above the
appropriate surface.
Rear Yards. Parking for recreational vehicles, travel trailers, trailers,
boats, snowmobiles, and other such recreational vehicles may occur on grass
surfaces in rear yards.
Recreational Trails. No person shall cause the parking of vehicles on any
recreational trails.
3.Â Â Â Declaration of Nuisance. The outside parking and storage of motor vehicles
and vehicles as defined above, on property used for residential purposes and/or
residentially zoned property, in violation of the requirements set forth in
this section, is declared to be a public nuisance because it (a) obstructs
views on streets and private property, (b) creates cluttered and otherwise
unsightly areas, (c) prevents full use of residential streets for residential
parking, (d) decreases adjoining landownersâ€™ and occupantsâ€™ enjoyment of their
property and neighborhood, and (e) otherwise adversely affects property values
and neighborhood patterns. Any violation of this section may be abated in the
manner provided for in Chapter 50, Code of Ordinances or Chapter 657 of the
Code of Iowa, or may be enforced under Chapter 4, Municipal Infractions, Code
of Ordinances.

90.15Â Â Â FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.
When any portion of the water service pipe which is the responsibility of the
property owner becomes defective or creates a nuisance and the owner fails to
correct such nuisance, the City may do so and assess the costs thereof to the
property.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3a and h])
90.16Â Â Â CURB VALVE.
There shall be installed within the public right-of-way a main shut- off valve
on the water service pipe of a pattern approved by the Superintendent. The

ground.
90.17Â Â Â INTERIOR VALVE.
There shall be installed a shut-off valve on every service pipe inside the
building as close to the entrance of the pipe within the building as possible
and so located that the water can be shut off conveniently. Where one service
pipe supplies more than one customer within the building, there shall be
separate valves for each such customer so that service may be shut off for one
without interfering with service to the others.
90.18Â Â Â INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.
All water service pipes and their connections to the water system must be
inspected and approved in writing by the Superintendent before they are
covered, and the Superintendent shall keep a record of such approvals. If the
Superintendent refuses to approve the work, the plumber or property owner must
proceed immediately to correct the work. Every person who uses or intends to
use the municipal water system shall permit the Superintendent to enter the
premises to inspect or make necessary alterations or repairs at all reasonable
hours and on proof of authority.
90.19Â Â Â COMPLETION BY THE CITY.
Should any excavation be left open or only partly refilled for 24 hours after
the water service pipe is installed and connected with the water system, or
should the work be improperly done, the City shall have the right to finish or
correct the work, and the Council shall assess the costs to the property owner
or the plumber. If the plumber is assessed, the plumber must pay the costs
before receiving another permit. If the property owner is assessed, such
assessment may be collected with and in the same manner as general property
taxes.

made against the City or Water Department by reason of the breakage of any
water service pipe, or from any other damage that may result from shutting off
water for repairing, laying or relaying mains, hydrants or other connections or
any other reasons. The Water Department shall give notice of shutting off water
if conditions are such that it is possible to do so. As a minimum the Water
Department shall give notice to the City. Other than emergencies, 24-hour
notice will be given for water shut off.
90.23Â Â Â OPERATION OF CURB VALVE.

Neither the City nor the Water Department shall be held responsible by reason
of the breaking of any water service pipe, apparatus, or water coil, or for
failure in the supply of water.
90.26Â Â Â CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL.
The purpose of cross-connection control is to safeguard potable water supplies
by preventing backflow into public water systems.
1.Â Â Â Plans shall be submitted to the City for review on all new water services
in order to determine the degree of hazard.
2.Â Â Â For contaminant other than private well sources, the Water Department,
with the concurrence of the City, shall determine the type of backflow
prevention assembly required for containment based on the degree of hazard. The
City shall require the installation of the appropriate backflow prevention
assembly by a qualified licensed plumber as specified in
Chapter 161, most current edition, except as modified and the International
Plumbing Code. The customer shall ensure that copies of records of the
installation and of all tests and repairs made to all backflow prevention
assemblies be submitted to the City within 15 days after testing and/or repairs
are completed.
3.Â Â Â For private well sources, a complete separation between the Municipal
Water System and the private well piping system will be required. Under no
circumstances shall there be any physical connection between these systems,
regardless of use of mechanical backflow preventers. Any violation of the
Cityâ€™s cross-connection policy will be subject to any or all of the following:
fines, municipal infractions, and charges necessary to bring the public water
supply back to IDNR standards as specified by the City.

within 12 months and at the main for a service which is abandoned.
90.28Â Â Â WELLS.
1.Â Â Â Private deep and sand-point wells in existence and use on March 31, 2012,
may remain active for the purpose of auxiliary, outdoor use, subject to the
cross-connection control provisions of Section
90.26 of this chapter.
2.Â Â Â No person shall construct or reconstruct (re-drill) a well for the
production of water when the property to be served has a municipal water main
adjacent to the said property, except that property owners may construct and/or
reconstruct existing wells that are used solely to service agricultural
livestock or for irrigation, and other non- human uses.
3.Â Â Â The replacement and repair of pump equipment will be allowed.
4.Â Â Â A permit will be required for any such construction, reconstruction, or
replacement.
5.Â Â Â The Council may approve a request to construct or reconstruct a well for
human consumption or other uses when municipal water services are not currently
available to the property.
6.Â Â Â Any person granted permission to construct or reconstruct a well may, as a
condition of that permission, be required to allow periodic testing by the
City, the County Health Department, or a designee of either, and may be
required to extend and connect to the municipal system, pay the required fees,
and exclusively use municipal water service when:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any new construction is undertaken on the property, and the municipal
water system is immediately adjacent or along said property; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Testing or inspection indicates that further use of the well is a
health hazard.
7.Â Â Â A person wishing to construct or reconstruct a well pursuant to this
section shall make application with the City and, upon approval of the same,
shall sign a Memorandum of Agreement agreeing to the provisions of this
section. Any such agreement shall be recorded with the County Recorder and
shall run with the land in perpetuity.

liable for the cost of repairs.
91.08Â Â Â RIGHT OF ENTRY.
The Superintendent shall be permitted to enter the premises of any customer at
any reasonable time to read, remove, or change a meter. Refusal on the part of

time when requested in writing, but not more often than once in six months.
Such request shall be accompanied by a refundable deposit of $50.00,
guaranteeing payment of costs if found due. If the meter is found to overrun to
the extent of two percent or more, the cost of the test shall be paid by the
City and a refund shall be made to the customer for overcharges collected since
the last known date of accuracy but not for longer than three months, plus the
meter test deposit. If the meter is found to be accurate or slow, or less than
two percent fast, the customer deposit shall be forfeited as the reasonable
costs of the test, and the customer shall be liable for any deficiency over two
percent up to three months.

Recommendations
93.07 Water Conservation Warning        93.14 Appeal Procedures
Â 
93.01Â Â Â PURPOSE.
The purpose of water conservation regulations is to impose such restriction as
deemed necessary for purposes of conserving water to protect public health.
From time to time during and following drought conditions, or due to equipment
failure, the Cityâ€™s water supply may become significantly and seriously
depleted so that there will not then be a sufficient supply of water to meet
all customary and usual demands.
93.02Â Â Â DECLARATION OF WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES.
Under conditions where water conservation efforts are deemed necessary, the
Council may find, and declare by resolution, a public â€œwater watch,â€ â€œwater
warning,â€ or â€œwater emergencyâ€ during which time certain measures,
restrictions, limitations, and provisions shall be in effect to produce an
orderly and equitable reduction of water consumption until, by resolution, the
Council finds and declares the water shortage condition to be ended.
93.03Â Â Â MAYOR PROCLAMATION.Â Â 
In the event the Council is unable to meet in an expedient manner, the Mayor
may declare a water emergency for a period of 48 hours to allow time for the
Council to meet and to establish a water watch, warning, or emergency for the
City.
93.04Â Â Â WATER CONSERVATION APPEALS. Â 
Members of the Council shall hear appeals of any action taken prudent to the
water warning or water emergency.
93.05Â Â Â WATER CONSERVATION WATCH.Â Â 
A water watch may be declared when a water shortage or equipment failure poses
a potential threat to the ability of the water system to meet the needs of its

1Â Â Â Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2 (455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2Â Â Â The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3Â Â Â Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4Â Â Â Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a

2.Â Â Â â€œCompanyâ€ means Palo Cooperative Telephone Association, the grantee of

chapter.
113.03Â Â Â FRANCHISE GRANTED.
The regulatory ordinance codified herein which grants to the Company the
nonexclusive right to construct, operate and maintain a cable television system
in the City was passed and adopted by the Council after a full, open, and
public proceeding. The proceeding was held after public notice was given and
afforded all interested parties the opportunity to comment upon the legal,
character, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the Company.
Having received at said proceeding all comments regarding the qualifications of
the Company, the City found that the Company possesses the necessary legal,
technical, character, financial and other qualifications and that the Companyâ€™s
construction arrangements are adequate and feasible. Therefore, the City grants
to the Company a nonexclusive franchise, right and privilege to construct,
erect, operate, modify and maintain in, upon, among, across, above and over and
under the highways, streets, alleys, sidewalks, public ways and public places
now laid out or dedicated and all extensions thereof, and additions thereto in

television conductors and fixtures necessary for the maintenance and operation
in the City of a cable television system for the purpose of distributing
television and radio signals, and other electronic impulses in order to furnish
television and radio programs, and various communications and other electronic
services to the public. The right so granted includes the right to use and

113.05Â Â Â TRANSFER.
The Company shall not sell or transfer its system to another, or transfer any
rights under this chapter to another without written notice and approval by the
City; provided, that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld if the
vendee, assignee or lessee has filed with the appropriate official of the City
an instrument duly executed, reciting the fact of such sale, assignment or
lease, accepting the terms of this chapter and agreeing to perform all
conditions thereof.
113.06Â Â Â COMPANY RULES AND REGULATIONS.
The Company shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable the Company to exercise its rights and perform

by any other cause, to an extent that the structural strength or stability
thereof is materially less than it was before the catastrophe;
12.Â Â Â Any building, structure, or portion thereof is in violation of this
chapter so as to constitute such building, structure, or portion thereof an
unsafe condition; and

of this chapter shall constitute a waiver of rights to an administrative
hearing and adjudication of the notice and order or any portion thereof.
3.Â Â Â Only those matters or issues specifically raised by the appellant shall be
considered in the hearing of the appeal.
4.Â Â Â After hearing all testimony, the Council shall have 15 days to issue a
decision. The decision shall be in writing and shall contain findings of fact,
a determination of the issues presented, and the requirements to be complied

                                         Improvements
Â 
152.01Â Â Â PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish and maintain improved drainage
throughout the City, to place the responsibility for the maintenance, repair,
replacement, or reconstruction of culverts upon the abutting property owner and
to minimize the liability of the City. Roadway ditches are an important aspect
of the Cityâ€™s stormwater management system, which can be significantly impacted
by driveways and associated culverts as private improvements. The failure to
comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be deemed a nuisance as
defined and enforceable in
Chapter 50 of this Code.
152.02Â Â Â DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter the following terms are defined:

152.03Â Â Â REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE, DEBRIS, AND ACCUMULATIONS.
It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to remove snow, ice,
debris, and any other accumulations promptly from culverts, so that culverts
are clear and functioning as part of the Cityâ€™s drainage system. If a property
owner does not remove snow, ice, debris, or accumulations within a reasonable
amount of time, which is usually 24 hours, the City may do so and assess the
costs against the property owner for collection in the same manner as a
nuisance.
152.04Â Â Â RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to maintain in a safe
and hazard-free condition any culvert outside the lot and property lines and
inside the curb lines or traveled portion of the public street. In the event
the City needs to remove, repair, or replace a culvert as part of any
infrastructure project, the City shall be responsible for the costs of initial
regrading and reseeding upon completion of the project, but this requirement
does not relieve the abutting property owner of the other responsibilities set
out in this chapter.
152.05Â Â Â CITY MAY ORDER REPAIRS.
If the abutting property owner does not maintain culverts as required, the
Council may serve notice on such owner, by certified mail, requiring the owner
to repair, replace or reconstruct culverts within a reasonable time and if such
action is not completed within the time stated in the notice, the Council may
require the work to be done and assess the costs against the abutting property
for collection in the same manner as a nuisance.
152.06Â Â Â CULVERT CONSTRUCTION ORDERED.
The Council may order the construction of permanent culverts in the right-of-
way of any street or court in the City and may assess the costs against the
property owner for collection in the same manner as a nuisance.
152.07Â Â Â PERMIT REQUIRED.
No person shall remove, reconstruct, or install a culvert unless such person
has obtained a permit from the City and has agreed in writing that said
removal, reconstruction or installation will comply with all ordinances and
requirements of the City for such work.
152.08Â Â Â CULVERT STANDARDS.
All culverts repaired, replaced, installed, or constructed in the City shall be
in accordance with
Chapter 161 and the approved plan of improvements for said culverts.
152.09Â Â Â FAILURE TO REPAIR OR BARRICADE.
It is the duty of the owner of the property abutting the culvert, or the
ownerâ€™s contractor or agent, to notify the City immediately in the event of the
failure of a culvert or the inability to make necessary culvert improvements.
152.10Â Â Â INTERFERENCE WITH CULVERT IMPROVEMENTS.
No person shall knowingly or willfully drive any vehicle upon any portion of
any culvert or approach thereto while in the process of being improved or upon
any portion of any completed culvert or approach thereto, or shall remove or
destroy any part or all of any culvert or approach thereto, or shall remove,
destroy, block, mar or deface any culvert at any time or destroy, mar, block,

included in the estimated cost of repair.
34.Â Â Â â€œSubstantial improvementâ€ means any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure taking place
during a 10-year period, the cumulative cost of which, equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure either: (i) before the start of
construction of the first improvement of the structure; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of the
first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be added
to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in original
floor space would exceed 25 percent.
35.Â Â Â  â€œVarianceâ€ means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the
floodplain management regulations.
36.Â Â Â â€œViolationâ€ means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the communityâ€™s floodplain management regulations.
160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare. Â 
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by
the: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect
of obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Subsection 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply

dated May 22nd, 2024, which were prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study
for Linn County, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Linn County Flood Insurance Study is hereby
adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for the administering
floodplain management regulations. The flood profiles and all explanatory
material contained with the Flood Insurance Study are also declared to be a
part of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered, without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations that
apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
6.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
7.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City, or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
8.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

160.05Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this ordinance are hereby
divided into the following districts:
1.Â Â Â Floodway (Overlay) District (FW) â€“ those areas identified as Floodway on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
2.Â Â Â Floodway Fringe Overlay District (FF) â€“ those areas identified as Zone AE
on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map but excluding those areas identified as
Floodway.
3.Â Â Â General Floodplain Overlay District (GF) covers those areas identified as
Zone A on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this ordinance is granted after due consideration by
the Board of Adjustment.
160.06Â Â Â FLOODWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT (FW).
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
the underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards. All Floodway District uses allowed as a permitted
use shall meet the following standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No development shall be permitted in the Floodway District that would
result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All development within the Floodway District shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any other
drainage facility or system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District, and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway
District within the time available after flood warning.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.07Â Â Â FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FF).
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards.
Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may increase the base
flood elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be responsible for
providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of two feet above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill, which shall, at all points, be no lower than two feet above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces,
and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below
the base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access,
and low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and
ceiling of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five feet or more,
the applicant shall be required to sign and record with the Linn County
Recorder a Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area
remains compliant with the criteria outlined in this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or, in the case of non-residential
structures, optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of two feet above the base
flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of two feet above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage systems
may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Utility and Sanitary Systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as the
discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities (other
than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection equal
to or greater than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than two feet above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of two feet above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Subdivision. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for all subdivisions shall include base flood
elevation data for those areas located within the Floodplain (Overlay)
District.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than two feet above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least two feet above the base
flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Paragraph D(1) of this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the
requirements of Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and
elevation of factory-built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Â Â Â Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of two feet above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces, and other factors associated with the 0.2 percent annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2 percent chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator. Where 0.2
percent chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determinations.
160.08Â Â Â GENERAL FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT (FP).
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development within the General Floodplain District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
the underlying zoning district) and provided they meet the applicable
performance standards of the General Floodplain District.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-built
homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation, or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine: (i) whether the land involved is either
wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the base
flood elevation. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
the determination.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for
the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than
two square miles, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel modification
that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2), Iowa
Administrative Code.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway as
determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the applicable
provisions and standards of the Floodway Overlay District (Section
160.06).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway
fringe as determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the
applicable provisions and standards of the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) (Section
160.07).
160.09Â Â Â APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall hear and
decide: (i) appeals; and (ii) requests for variances to the provisions of this
chapter, and shall take any other action which is required of the Board.
1.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged that there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
2.Â Â Â Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator
that: (i) that the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal or
a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept onto other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â m.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Limitation of periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
4.Â Â Â Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in
the office of the Board.
160.10Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but that is
not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject
to the following conditions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
2.Â Â Â Except as provided in Subsection 1(B) of this section, any use which has
been permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.11Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00. Each
day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing
herein contained prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
160.12Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.

165.20Â Â Â APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
1.Â Â Â Regulations to Be Uniformly Applied. The regulations set by this chapter
shall apply uniformly within each district to each class or kind of structure
or land, except as hereinafter provided.
2.Â Â Â All Uses and Structures to Conform. No building, structure, or land shall
be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall be
erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in
conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in
which it is located.
3.Â Â Â Height, Density and Yards Shall Not Be Violated. No building or other
structure shall be erected or altered to exceed the height, to accommodate or
house a greater number of families, or to have narrower or smaller rear yards,
front yards, side yards, or other open spaces than herein required or in any
other manner contrary to the provisions of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Separate Yards, Open Space and Off-Street Parking Required. No part of a
yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required
about or in connection with any building for the purposes of complying with
this chapter shall be included as a part of a yard, open space, or off-street
parking or loading space similarly required for any other building.
5.Â Â Â Minimum Yards and Lot Areas Shall Not Be Reduced. No yard or lot existing
at the time of passage of this chapter shall be reduced in dimension or area
below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after
the effective date of this chapter shall meet at least the minimum requirements
established by this chapter. A lot or yard may be reduced in size if the City
deems for a public purpose.
165.21Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â Intent. If within the districts established by this chapter or amendments
that may later be adopted there exist lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this zoning code was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this
chapter or future amendments, it is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of the
zoning code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or
extended, or be used as grounds for adding other structures, signs or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in
this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code and
upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. â€œActual
constructionâ€ is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner, except that
if the demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to
be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until
completion of the building involved.
2.Â Â Â Nonconforming Lots of Record.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even
though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width or both that
are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
other requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of area, width, and yard requirements shall be obtained only through
action of the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements for lot width and area as established by this zoning code, the
land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of
this Zoning Code, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which
does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this zoning code
nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot
with width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning Code.
3.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code, a lawful use of land exists that is made no
longer permissible under the terms of this Zoning Code as enacted and amended,
such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to
occupy a greater use of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 18 consecutive months, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in
which such land is located.
4.Â Â Â Nonconforming Structures - General. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code that could not be
built under the terms of this Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area,
lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be so continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than 75 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall
not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Nonconforming Structures - 2008 Flood. Where a lawful structure exists at
the time of the June 2008 flood that could not be built under the terms of this
zoning code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or
other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such
structure may be so continued, repaired or replaced so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â This Subsection 165.21(5)(A) only applies to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Structures on properties that are wholly outside of the 100- year
flood plain.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Structures that were damaged primarily due to the flood of June
2008.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Structures for which a building permit is applied for and approved
on or before December 31, 2009.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The single principal building on the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The single major project, whether repair, reconstruction, or
replacement.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity, except as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The applicant has submitted grading and drainage plans that are
sufficient in accuracy and detail, as determined by the City Engineer, so that
the potential impact of the proposed structure can be evaluated with respect to
immediately surrounding properties, the neighborhood and the community at
large;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The proposed structure will not adversely impact the use and
enjoyment of the immediately surrounding properties by their owners, the
neighborhood more generally, and the community at large with respect to
drainage, access, and use of right-of-way and easements (public or private);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The â€œfootprintâ€ of the proposed structure on the site will not be
increased by greater than 15 percent;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The proposed structure will not project any further into required
rear and side yard setbacks than does the existing building;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The front yard setback for the proposed structure and any permanent
attachment or addition to the proposed structure will be at least 10 feet;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â No permitted addition to a nonconforming structure will include a
wall within 10 feet of a window of an adjacent pre-existing residential
structure; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The proposed structure will not be placed on or over any private or
public easement.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances from the standards set forth in this section shall be heard
and decided by the Board of Adjustment. In these cases, the Board shall
consider,
in addition to the criteria for variances set forth in Section
165.24(6)(E). the following criteria and factors:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â It is the Cityâ€™s preference that property owners adversely and
significantly affected by the June 2008 flood be allowed to repair,
reconstruct, or replace damaged structures while still complying with the
general intent, spirit, and purpose of these Zoning Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â It is the applicantâ€™s burden to demonstrate that there are no other
reasonable alternatives available to reconstruct or replace the existing
principal structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The proposed structure will not adversely impact the use and
enjoyment of immediately surrounding properties by their owners, the
neighborhood more generally, and the community at large with respect to
drainage, access, and use of right-of-way and easements (public or private).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Any side or rear yard shall not be less than five feet under any
circumstances in residential districts in the event a variance is granted.
6.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or of
structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Code, that would not be allowed in the district
under the terms of this Zoning Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â When a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 18 consecutive months, the
structure thereafter shall not be used except in conformance with regulations
of the district in which it is located.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Where nonconforming use status is applied to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
7.Â Â Â Repairs or Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part to any
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 18 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures,
wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10 percent of the current
replacement value of the building, provided that the cubic content of the
building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter is
not increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening of or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the
public safety, upon order of such official.
8.Â Â Â Uses Under Exception Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use for which
a special exception is permitted as provided in this chapter shall not be
deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further action be deemed a
conforming use in such district.
165.22Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
An Administrative Officer designated by the Council shall administer and
enforce this chapter. Said officer may be provided with the assistance of such
other persons as the Council may direct. If the Administrative Officer finds

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Appeals. Appeals concerning the interpretation or administration of
this chapter may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved or
by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected by any
decision of the Administrative Officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed
60 days, by filing with the Administrative Officer and with the Secretary of
the Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Administrative Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time, not exceeding
30 days from the date of appeal, for the hearing, give public notice thereof as
well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a
reasonable time, not exceeding 15 days after the date of the hearing. At the
hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Stay of Proceeding. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Administrative Officer from whom the
appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal
is filed with such officer, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate,
a stay would, in the opinion of the Administrative Officer, cause imminent
peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other
than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or
by a court of record on application, on notice to the Administrative Officer
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Special Exceptions: Conditions Governing Applications; Procedures. The
Board shall hear and decide only such special exceptions as the Board of
Adjustment is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this chapter;
decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions
should be granted; and grant special exceptions with such conditions and
safeguards as are appropriate under this chapter, or deny special exceptions
when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. A special
exception shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A written application for a special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notice shall be given in accordance with Section
165.27(1).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person,
or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that it is empowered
under the section of this chapter described in the application to grant the
special exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not
adversely affect the public interest.
In granting any special exception, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter. The Board of Adjustment shall prescribe a time limit within which
the action for which the special exception is required shall be begun or
completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within
the time limit set shall void the special exception.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Variances; Conditions Governing Application; Procedures. The Board
shall authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of
this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to the
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter
would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter
shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no
permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with
Subsection
165.27(1) and in accordance with the State Open Meetings Law (Chapter 21 of the
Code of Iowa).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person,
or by agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make findings that the requirements
of Subparagraph (1) above have been met by the applicant for a variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. Under no
circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance to allow a use not
permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved, or any
use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said
district.
165.25Â Â Â INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion of the public
health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Wherever the requirements of this
chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted
rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions or covenants, the most
restrictive, or that imposing higher standards, shall govern.
165.26Â Â Â VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
1.Â Â Â Any person, firm or entity who violates or fails to comply with the
provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be required
to pay all costs and expenses involved in the prosecution of the violation. Any
violation or failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter by any
person, firm, or corporation shall also constitute a municipal infraction. Each
day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
2.Â Â Â The owners or tenant of any building, structure, land, or part thereof,
and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits,
participates in, assists in, or maintains a violation or fails to comply with
any provision of this chapter may each be charged with such violation. Each day
such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
3.Â Â Â If any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or if any building, structure, or
land is used in violation of this chapter, the City may, in addition to other
remedies, institute an injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate lawful action
necessary to prevent, correct or abate such violation.
165.27Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
1.Â Â Â Procedure. The regulations imposed and the districts created by this
chapter may be amended from time to time by the Council, but no such amendments
shall be made without public hearing before the Council and after a report upon
the amendment from the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the Commission makes
no report within 60 days from the date of passage of the Councilâ€™s motion
referring the matter to the Commission, the Council may proceed with a public
hearing without such report or recommendation. At least seven daysâ€™ notice of
the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having
general circulation in the City. In the event the Commission recommends
disapproval of the change or, in the event of a protest against such change
filed with the Council and signed by the owners of 20 percent or more either of
the area of the lots included in the proposed change or of those immediately
adjacent in the rear thereof extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed
200 feet therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto, extending the depth
on one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from the street frontage of such opposite
lots, such amendment shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of at
least three-fourths of all the members of the Council.
2.Â Â Â Form of Application. An application for rezoning shall contain the
following items:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The legal description and local address of the property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The present zoning classification and the zoning classification
requested for the property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The existing use and proposed use of the property.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The names and addresses of the owners of all property within 200 feet
of the property for which the change is requested.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â A statement of the reasons why the applicant feels the zoning
classification should be changed.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â A plat showing the locations, dimensions, and use of the applicantâ€™s
property and all property within 200 feet thereof, including streets, alleys,
railroads, and other physical features.
3.Â Â Â Application Fee. Before any action is taken upon an application as
provided in this section, the applicant shall pay to the Administrative Officer
a fee in such amount as may be established by resolution of the Council. The
Administrative Officer shall forthwith pay over such fees to the credit of the
General Fund of the City. The application fee required by this section shall

Â 
166.01Â Â Â PURPOSE AND POLICY.
The Council finds that in order to ensure public safety; provide efficient
delivery of services by the City and others wishing to utilize wireless
communication technologies; ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the
population; provide for the regulation and administration and orderly location
of antennas, towers, utility poles, and other communications equipment
including, but not limited to, transmission equipment and small wireless
facilities; and secure the rights of the City to regulate its public property
and charge a reasonable fee for use of public property, it is necessary for the
City to establish these uniform rules, regulations, and policies.
166.02Â Â Â DEFINITIONS.
Unless otherwise stated herein, terms and phrases used in this chapter shall
have their normal and customary meanings, except those terms and phrases that
are defined in Chapter 8C of the Code of Iowa, which shall have the same
meaning as stated therein.
166.03Â Â Â LOCAL REGULATION.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits the City from establishing
policies that discriminate against one provider or group of providers in favor
of another provider or group of providers or potential providers. The following
objectives shall be applied consistently to all telecommunications providers,
wireless or otherwise, that request a location for their communication towers
and antennas on public or private property within the City:
1.Â Â Â To ensure that new towers and utility poles will blend into their
environment, providers will propose designs consistent with site
characteristics.
2.Â Â Â To maximize safety, new towers and utility poles will be located away from
population and employment centers and siting of new towers will include fall
zone setbacks as specified herein.
166.04Â Â Â FACILITIES LOCATED ON CITY PROPERTY.
No tower, utility pole, wireless support structure, or transmission equipment
shall be installed or constructed within or on any property owned by the City,
including rights-of-way, except in accordance with a franchise agreement duly
adopted and approved by the City, and except on any existing tower, utility
pole, or wireless support structure upon which any transmission equipment has
been installed prior to the effective date of this ordinance.
166.05Â Â Â ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND SETBACK AND MAXIMUM HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.
1.Â Â Â A tower or utility pole shall be a permitted use in any commercial or
industrial zone, and a conditional use in any residential zone.
2.Â Â Â A tower or utility pole must be set back from lot lines of all zoning
districts a distance equal to or greater than the height of the tower or
utility pole; however, if the tower or utility pole manufacturer certifies that
the tower or utility pole is designed to collapse within a smaller area, the
setbacks may be reduced consistent with said certification, but shall in no
case be less than 50 percent of the height of the tower or utility pole. Use of
the tower manufacturerâ€™s certification to reduce the setback as described
herein is subject to the review of the City Engineer and approval by the
Council.
3.Â Â Â Any transmission equipment located on the roof of an antenna support
structure must be set back at least one foot from the edge of the roof of the
structure. This setback requirement shall not apply to communications
facilities located above the roof of the structure, if the facilities are:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Appropriately screened from view through the use of panels, walls,
fences, or other screening techniques approved by the City; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Camouflaged antennas that are mounted to the exterior of the antenna
support structures below the roof but do not protrude more than 24 inches from
the side of such an antenna support structure.
4.Â Â Â A new, replacement, or modified tower, utility pole, or other facility
erected within a City right-of-way shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in
height above the tallest utility pole existing on July 1, 2017, or on the date
the application is submitted, if prior to July 1, 2017, located within 500 feet
of the new, replacement, or modified tower, utility pole, or other facility in
the same City right-of-way; or 40 feet in height above ground level.
166.06Â Â Â APPROVAL PROCESS FOR ALL TOWERS, UTILITY POLES, AND OTHER FACILITIES.
The following procedures shall apply to all tower, utility pole, or other
facilities on public or private property.
1.Â Â Â Submission of Materials and Basis for Approval or Denial. The following
information shall be submitted to the Clerk and will be utilized by the City in
review of the application, except that items C, I, and K shall not be required
when a facility is to be located on an existing structure, if the antenna is
proposed to be located on a tower owned by the City or constructed on City
property and intended to be used for collocation of antennas:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A fee of $500.00 if the application is for an eligible facilities
request or small wireless facility and $1,000.00 if the application is for a
new tower, for the initial placement or installation of transmission equipment
on a wireless support structure, for a modification of an existing tower or
base station, or any other application to construct or place transmission
equipment that does not constitute an eligible facilities request.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â One copy of specifications for proposed structures and antennas,
including a description of the design characteristics and material to be used.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A Site Plan drawn to scale showing existing features, including
property lines, existing structures, and other improvements; all structures
within 200 feet of the proposed facility; proposed features including facility
location, facility height, guy wires and anchors; photographs or elevation
drawings depicting design of the proposed facility; parking; fences; and
landscape plan. The Site Plan is not required if the antenna is to be mounted
on an existing structure.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A current map or update for an existing map on file showing the
locations of the ownerâ€™s existing antennas or facilities and proposed
facilities.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â A report from a structural engineer showing each new tower or utility
pole capacity by type and number and a certification that such tower or utility
pole is designed to withstand winds in accordance with ANS/EIA/TIA-222 (latest
revision) standards, and a proposed plan and schedule for periodic maintenance
and inspection of the tower by qualified parties.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Identification of the owners of all equipment to be located on the
site.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Written authorization from the site owner for the application.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Evidence that a valid FCC license for the proposed activity has been
applied for or issued if licensing is required for the particular tower or
antenna.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â An analysis that shows the potential visual impacts of a new facility.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Additional information, as requested by the City, to determine that all
applicable zoning regulations are met.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â An explanation regarding the reason for choosing the proposed location
and the reason the applicant did not choose collocation, including a sworn
statement from an individual who has responsibility over placement of the tower
attesting that collocation within the area determined by the applicant to meet
the applicantâ€™s radio frequency engineering requirements for the placement of a
site would not result in the same mobile service functionality, coverage, and
capacity, is technically infeasible, or is economically burdensome to the
applicant.
2.Â Â Â Review and Action. The following process shall be observed in the review
and final City action on any application:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Upon receipt of the application, the Clerk shall forward copies of the

15 days if the application is for a small wireless facility.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The owner shall provide a response to the draft report in writing, and
the City Engineerâ€™s report shall be finalized and placed on the Council meeting
agenda together with the applicantâ€™s submission materials and all related
documents within 30 days of receipt of the response and any additional
information required in the draft report.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Council may approve the application with no conditions, approve the
application with conditions, or disapprove the application by simple majority
vote.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Unless agreed in writing by the applicant, approval, or denial by the

receiving the application, for a collocation or installation on or a
modification of an existing structure within 90 days of the City receiving the
application, and for a small wireless facility within 60 days.
166.07Â Â Â PERMITTING AND INSPECTIONS.
A City permit is required prior to the start of any tower construction
activity. In addition, a City permit is required prior to the start of any
tower modification including collocation or replacement. The permit shall
include the following information:
1.Â Â Â Permit cover/information sheet on a form provided by the City.
2.Â Â Â Structural and operational information provided by registered engineers
and certification by those engineers that the project as proposed is

166.08Â Â Â NOTIFICATIONS.
Once a tower or utility pole is constructed, the owner shall notify the Clerk
of any change by sale, transfer, or disposal of any such facility. All new
tower or utility pole construction shall be reported by the owner to the County
Assessor.
166.09Â Â Â ABANDONMENT.
In the event the use of any communications tower or utility pole has been
discontinued for a period of 60 consecutive days, the tower or utility pole
shall be deemed to be abandoned. The City may require that any abandoned tower
or utility pole be removed by owner if the City provides to the owner written
notice that such tower or utility pole has been deemed abandoned and such owner
does not take the actions necessary to reinstate the tower or utility pole
within 30 clays of receiving the written notice. If the owner fails to
reinstate or remove the tower or utility pole within 60 days of receiving the
written notice, the City may act to remove the tower or utility pole and the
costs of such removal shall be assessed to the owner. The owner shall be deemed
to have received a written notice under this section four days after it is
mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address listed on
any application submitted to the City for the installation or use of such tower
or utility pole or to another address provided to the City by the owner.

170.01Â Â Â SHORT TITLE.
This chapter shall be known as the â€œSubdivision Ordinanceâ€ of the City.
170.02Â Â Â POLICY AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â Policy.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â It is declared to be the policy of the City to consider the subdivision
of land and the subsequent development of the subdivided plat as subject to the
control of the City pursuant to the official comprehensive plan of the City for
the orderly, planned, efficient, and economical development of the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood
or other menace, and land shall not be subdivided until adequate public
facilities and improvements exist and proper provision has been made for
drainage, water, sewerage, and capital improvements such as schools, parks,
recreational facilities, transportation facilities, and improvements.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be
properly related to the proposals shown in the comprehensive plan, official
map, construction standards, design standards, and the capital budget and
program of the City, and it is intended that these regulations shall supplement
and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and standards contained in
building and housing codes, zoning ordinances, the comprehensive plan, official
map, and land use plan, and the capital budget and program of the City.
2.Â Â Â Purpose. These regulations are adopted for the following purposes:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To guide the future growth and development of the City in accordance
with the comprehensive plan.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To provide for adequate light, air, and privacy, to reduce the risk of
fire, flood, and other danger, and to prevent overcrowding of the land and
undue congestion of population.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To protect the character and the social and economic stability of all
parts of the City and to encourage the orderly and beneficial development of
the community through appropriate growth management techniques assuring the
timing and sequencing of development in existing neighborhoods and non-
residential areas with adequate public facilities, to assure proper urban form
and open space separation of urban areas, to protect environmentally critical
areas and areas premature for urban development.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â To protect and conserve the value of land throughout the City and the
value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and to minimize the
conflicts among the uses of land and buildings.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide
adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks,
playgrounds, recreation, and other public requirements and facilities.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â To provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land
and buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the City, having
particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways

improvements required by this chapter,
Chapter 161, and as shown on the preliminary plat within the subdivision
proper. All required improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the
aforementioned design standards established for such improvements as defined by
SUDAS and shall be reviewed by the City and the City Engineer.
1.Â Â Â Urban Renewal Area Exception. The City may consider waiving portions of
this section if all of the following circumstances exist:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The subdivision is located within an active urban renewal area eligible
for tax increment reimbursement, and;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The subdivider can demonstrate how the Cityâ€™s participation in cost
sharing for improvements within the subdivision will achieve the goals and
objectives of the urban renewal area, and;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The subdivider is prepared to offer the City an infrastructure
improvement, property, or service that is equal or commensurate to the Cityâ€™s
financial contribution and meets the stated goals and objectives of the Cityâ€™s
Urban Renewal Plan.
2.Â Â Â In some cases, there may be a need to extend municipal utilities and
services to the edge of a subdivision. The City will decide on a case-by-case
basis as to the financial responsibilities of the subdivider and the City
regarding these utility and service extensions
170.10Â Â Â INSPECTION.
1.Â Â Â Construction Observation. All improvements shall be inspected to ensure
compliance with the approved plans, technical specifications and details by the
City Engineer. It is the ultimate responsibility of the subdivider and his or
her professional engineer to provide assurance that the required improvements
are constructed in accordance with the approved plans, technical specifications
and details, and any specific standards contained in this Code. The cost of
such inspection shall be borne by the subdivider and shall be the actual cost
of the inspection to the City. Reimbursements for said costs shall be received
prior to Final Plat approval. No building permits or certificates of occupancy
shall be issued until all fees are paid in full. The subdivider shall provide
the City Engineer with a construction schedule prior to the commencement of any
and all construction and notify the City Engineer not less than 48 hours in
advance of readiness for required inspections.
2.Â Â Â Materials Testing. In addition, materials testing may be required by a
professional testing service as he or she may deem necessary to assure that the
public improvements meet the Design Standards and Specifications Manuals and
any specific standards contained in this Code or the laws of the State or the
United States. Materials testing shall be coordinated by the City Engineer and
paid for by the subdivider in the same manner that the inspections are paid for
above.
170.11Â Â Â MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
The improvements set forth below shall be considered the minimum improvements
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. All of the minimum
improvements mandated by this section shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the requirements of SUDAS. The subdivider must provide evidence
of any and all construction permits, highway or road easements and access, or
other appropriate documentation from State or federal regulatory agencies prior
to approval of the final plat. Easements from all utility companies will also
be required. The City reserves the right to request changes to a proposed
subdivision that may exceed the municipal capacities for streets, sewer, water,
or other services. In this event, the City may request a proportional fee from
the subdivider, to be determined by the City and the City Engineer, for any
required capacity improvements.
1.Â Â Â Streets; General. The subdivider of land being subdivided shall provide
the grading of the entire street right-of-way, alley, or public place and
provide appropriate paving.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, dedication and improvement of a street having a width
greater than necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to
complete the City street system as it relates to both the area being platted
and other areas. In such event, the City may pay the subdivider the difference
in cost of improving the wider street and the street width reasonable to meet
the foreseeable needs of the subdivision taken alone. The streets shall, upon
final approval and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City.
2.Â Â Â Sanitary Sewer System; General. The subdivider of the land being platted
shall make adequate provision for the disposal of sanitary sewage from the
platted area with due regard being given to present or reasonably foreseeable
needs. There shall be constructed, at the subdividerâ€™s expense, a sanitary
sewer system including all necessary pumping stations, pumping equipment, sewer
access holes, and all other necessary or desirable appurtenances to provide for
the discharge of sanitary sewage from all lots or parcels of land within the
platted area to a connection with the Cityâ€™s sanitary sewer. The Cityâ€™s role in
reviewing the plans is to determine the sanitary sewerâ€™s placement, size, and
route.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a sanitary sewer that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
City sanitary sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The subdivider must provide evidence of construction permits from the
Iowa Department of Natural Resources prior to approval of the final plat.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The above-mentioned facilities for the collection and disposal of
sanitary sewage from the platted area shall, upon final approval and acceptance
by the City, become the property of the City.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Cityâ€™s inability to efficiently collect or treat wastewater may be
grounds for rejection of a proposed subdivision. A proportional fee may be
requested by the City from the subdivider, to pay for the necessary upgrades in
the sewer system.
3.Â Â Â Water Drainage System; General. The subdivider of land being platted shall
install and construct a drainage system adequate to serve the area, including
anticipated extension of use to serve additional areas.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The water drainage system shall be separated from and independent of
any sanitary sewer system. The acceptable standard for sizing the drainage
system is to be able to handle the 100-year storm event without damage to
public or private property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where
feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In the drainage system design phase, the subdividerâ€™s engineer shall
study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. The subdividerâ€™s drainage studies together
with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall serve as a guide to
needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff
incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of the
subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for the
improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Palo Technical Standards address and specify water quality volume
sizing criteria based on a one-inch average rainfall depth over the entire
site. Strictly in addition to this requirement, the developer shall provide for
infiltration practices that will satisfy volume requirements for an additional
zero-point five inch average rainfall depth over the entire site. The intent of
these infiltration practices is to further reduce stormwater runoff and improve
water quality treatment as merited by the challenging drainage conditions in
the City. The developer shall construct, protect, and maintain these areas for
three years or until fully established, whichever is longer, and which shall
not be disturbed by the property owner. When the City releases the developer
from this requirement, the property owner shall become responsible for
protecting and maintaining these areas in accordance with this chapter, the
Palo Technical Standards, and applicable State and federal law. No buildings,
structures, fences, play equipment, or kennels shall be permitted on all
drainage easement areas established to satisfy these additional infiltration
requirements. The subdivider should be aware that the City has unique drainage
issues and special care must be taken to avoid future water problems. Detention
basin ownership shall remain private to the lot owner.
4.Â Â Â Water Main System; General. The subdivider of land being platted shall
install and construct a water main system to adequately serve all lots or
parcels of land within the platted area, with due regard to the present and
reasonably foreseeable needs of the entire area, and shall connect the same to
the Cityâ€™s existing water mains. The water main system shall be in accordance
with SUDAS.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The subdivider shall install adequate water facilities, and fire
hydrants which shall be subject to SUDAS specifications and shall be subject
for review and approval by the Fire Chief. The location of all fire hydrants
shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a water main that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
City water distribution system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas. In such event the City may pay the subdivider the difference in
cost of pipe between the larger water main and the diameter of water main
reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Cityâ€™s inability to generate, treat, or distribute water may be
grounds for rejection of a proposed subdivision. A proportional fee may be
requested by the City from the subdivider to pay for the necessary upgrades in
the water system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The water supply improvements shall, upon inspection, approval, and
acceptance by the City, become the property of the City.
5.Â Â Â Other Improvements. The owner and subdivider of the land being platted
shall be responsible for the installation of erosion control measures and the
installation of street lighting. All such improvements shall be under the
direction of the City Engineer.
6.Â Â Â Alternative Systems for Sewer and Water. Where connection to the City
sewer or water system cannot reasonably be made, the City Engineer may approve
alternate facilities for the distribution of water or the collection and
disposal of sanitary wastes or stormwater. Such alternate systems shall be
designed to fully protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and shall
meet all requirements of the State, County, or other applicable health
regulations. Prior to granting approval of such alternate systems, the owner
shall provide the City Engineer a waiver of assessment protest or such other
legally binding documents necessary to protect the City from the expense of the
subsequent installation of sewer or water facilities.
7.Â Â Â Street Lighting. New street lighting shall be installed within the right-
of-way of the overall boundary of the final plat. The developer/subdivider
shall be responsible for the preparation of a street lighting plan. Said street
lighting plan shall be reviewed and approved by the utility company servicing
said lights as well as the City Engineer. The costs associated with the
preparation of the plan and the design, fabrication and installation of the
streetlights shall be responsibility of the developer/subdivider. All
streetlights shall be designed for acceptable illuminance per current Design
Standards as specified in this Code of Ordinances. Allowable street lighting
fixtures shall be determined by the utility company servicing said lights.
8.Â Â Â Trees. The subdivider/developer shall be responsible for the installation
of a minimum of two trees per lot in both commercial and residential
subdivisions. All costs associated with installation shall be the

170.12Â Â Â EASEMENTS REQUIRED.
1.Â Â Â Public Utilities. The flexible placement of easements for public utilities
shall be allowed; however, such placement shall be subject to the review of the
Council and all applicable utility companies prior to approval of the final
plat. All utilities to serve each lot of a subdivision shall be placed in a
common easement. Said easements shall be at least 10 feet in width. Easements
of greater width may be required along lot lines, or across lots when necessary
for the placement and maintenance of utilities. No buildings or structures,
except as necessary for utilities, shall be permitted on such easements.
2.Â Â Â Easements Along Streams and Watercourses. Wherever any stream or surface
watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at his or her own expense, make adequate provisions for the proper
drainage of surface water and shall provide and dedicate to the City an
easement equal to the floodway along said stream or water course to ensure the
proper maintenance of the watercourse, as approved by the City.
170.13Â Â Â MAINTENANCE BOND REQUIRED.
The owner and subdivider of the land being platted shall be required to provide
to the City proper maintenance bonds satisfactory to the City, so as to insure
that for a period of two years from the date of acceptance of any underground
improvement or four years from the date of acceptance of any above-ground
improvement, the owner and subdivider shall be responsible to maintain such
improvement in good repair. A performance bond will also be required per
Section
170.35.
170.14Â Â Â STANDARDS PRESCRIBED.
The standards set forth in this chapter shall be considered the minimum
standards necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
These standards should also be considered in accordance with the requirements
of applicable State and federal agencies. In the event that the Cityâ€™s minimum
standards should conflict with applicable County, State, and federal
requirements, the County, State, and federal requirements shall prevail.
170.15Â Â Â LAND SUITABILITY.
No land shall be subdivided that is found to be unsuitable for subdividing by
reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage, adverse soil conditions, adverse
geological formations, historic or archeological conflicts, unsatisfactory
topography, or other conditions likely to be harmful to the public health,
safety, or general welfare, unless such unsuitable conditions are corrected to
the satisfaction of the City. If land is found to be unsuitable for subdivision
for any of the reasons cited in this section, the Council shall state its
reasons in writing and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present data
refuting such unsuitability. Thereafter, the Council may reaffirm, modify, or
withdraw its determination regarding such unsuitability.
170.16Â Â Â LANDS SUBJECT TO FLOODING.
No subdivision containing land located in a floodway or a flood hazard area
shall be approved by the City unless it is demonstrated that the subdivision
complies with all requirements of the Cityâ€™s Floodplain Management Regulations.
No lot shall be located so as to include land located within a floodway or
flood hazard area unless the lot is of such size and shape that it will contain
a buildable area, not within the floodway or flood hazard area, suitable for
development as allowed by the zone in which the lot is located. Those areas
subject to flooding shall be determined by the U.S. Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) flood plain map for the City. Land located within a
flood hazard area or a floodway may be included within a plat as follows,
subject to the approval of the City.
1.Â Â Â Included within individual lots in the subdivision, subject to the
limitations of this section.
2.Â Â Â Reserved as open space for recreation use by all owners of lots in the
subdivision, with an appropriate legal instrument, approved by the City,
providing for its care and maintenance by such owners.
3.Â Â Â If acceptable to the City, dedicated to the City as public open space for
recreation or flood control purposes.
170.17Â Â Â PLAT TO CONFORM TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets
shall conform to the specifications for such streets as approved by the
Council. The general nature and extent of the lots and uses proposed shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan of the City, provided such plan has been
adopted by the City; and shall conform to such other plans, including but not
limited to a Major Street Plan, a Sanitary Sewer System Plan, or a Parks and
Open Space Plan, provided such plan has been adopted by the City.
170.18Â Â Â STREET STANDARDS.
1.Â Â Â General. The following standards shall apply to all streets to be located
within the subdivision:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall provide for the continuation of arterial and collector
streets from adjoining platted areas, and the extension of such streets into
adjoining unplatted areas. Where a plat encompasses the location for an
arterial or collector street proposed in the Comprehensive Plan or the Street
Plan, the plat shall provide for such street.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Street grades shall align to existing streets, and all grades for
streets shall be as approved by the City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Arterial streets shall be located so as to not require direct access
from the arterial street to abutting lots.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street right-of-way widths and pavement widths shall be as specified in
the design standards for public improvements as defined by SUDAS.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Half-streets are prohibited, except, where an existing platted half-
street abuts the subdivision, a platted half-street to complete the street
shall be required.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Local streets should be designed to discourage through traffic while
safely connecting to collector or arterial streets.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred 125 feet
shall be prohibited, except where topography, or other physical conditions make
such jogs unavoidable.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible; and no
street shall intersect any other street at less than 60 degrees.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Dead end streets are prohibited, except where a street is planned to
continue past the subdividerâ€™s property, a temporary dead end may be allowed.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Streets that connect with other streets, or loop streets, are
preferable for maintenance, fire protection, and circulation, but cul-de-sacs
may be permitted if there are no other feasible alternatives available. Cul-de-
sacs shall not exceed 600 feet in length unless a greater length is
unavoidable.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â In general, alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas and
shall be required in commercial areas with normal street frontage. Dead end
alleys are prohibited, unless provided with a turn-around with a minimum right-
of- way diameter of 100 feet.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than 20 feet and a roadway
width of not less than 16 feet.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels,
such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and
opening of future streets and adequate utility connections. Easements for the
future openings and extensions for such streets or utilities may, at the
discretion of the Council, be made a requirement of the plat.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Streets that are or will become extensions of existing streets shall be
given the same name as the existing streets. New street names shall not be the
same or sound similar to existing street names. All street names shall be at
the approval of the Council.
Â Â Â O.Â Â Â Private streets shall be prohibited. The Council may approve a variance
to this rule where unusual conditions make a private street desirable, provided
adequate covenants or other legal documents ensure that the City will not have
or need to assume any maintenance or other responsibility for such street.
2.Â Â Â Minimum roadway and right-of-way standards defined by SUDAS.
3.Â Â Â Street Grades defined by SUDAS.
4.Â Â Â Street Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer, water, and other utilities
to be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed by the
subdivider, the subdivider shall construct a roadway to the following
standards:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â After sewer and water utilities have been installed by the developer,
the developer shall surface, or cause to be surfaced, roadways to the standards
prescribed in these regulations and the Palo Design Standards. At a minimum,
all surfacing shall be of a character as is suitable for expected traffic and
in harmony with similar improvements in surrounding areas. The type of pavement
shall be Portland cement concrete or, if approved by the City Engineer,
asphaltic cement equivalent. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts,
drains, and bridges. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements, and

pavement, and compacted to 90 percent of modified proctor density.
5.Â Â Â Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited
access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining
lands shall be treated as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In all districts a buffer strip at least 20 feet in depth in addition
to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided
adjacent to a limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted
lots and shall be designated on the plat: â€œThis strip is reserved for
screening. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited.â€
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 225 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
6.Â Â Â Sidewalks. Sidewalks are typically not required; however, if included in a
development, the following design standards shall apply to all subdividers in
accordance with SUDAS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet in width except in the
Central Business District or in other areas specifically approved by the
Council of the City where the width may be greater. Sidewalks shall be located
one foot from the property line within the dedicated non-pavement right-of-way
of all streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Sidewalk Ramps. All sidewalks shall provide a curb ramp for
accommodation of the disabled at all intersections. Curb ramps shall be located
in line with the public sidewalk. Curb ramps shall comply with all requirements
for said ramps as set forth in the â€œAmericans With Disabilities Act.â€ Ramps
shall be sloped from the sidewalk intersection to the curb.
7.Â Â Â Driveways. The following standards shall apply to residential driveways in

The following standards shall apply to the layout of blocks and lots in all
subdivisions:
1.Â Â Â No residential block shall be longer than 1,300 feet or shorter than 300
feet measured from street line to street line. The width of blocks should be
arranged so as to allow two tiers of lots, with utility easement.
2.Â Â Â In blocks over 700 feet in length, the Council may require a public way or
an easement at least 25 feet in width, at or near the center of the block, for
use by pedestrians.
3.Â Â Â The size and shape of lots intended for commercial or industrial use shall
be adequate to provide for the use intended, and to meet the parking, loading,
and other requirements for such uses contained in the zoning ordinance.
4.Â Â Â Lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide
satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and surrounding
land uses.
5.Â Â Â The size, area, minimum widths, and minimum depths of all lots shall
comply with all requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zone in which the
lot is located.
6.Â Â Â All lots shall abut a public street or an approved private street.
7.Â Â Â Unless unavoidable, lots shall not front, or have direct access to
arterial streets. Where unavoidable, lots shall be so arranged as to minimize
the number of access points.
8.Â Â Â All lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial
to curved street lines, except where in the judgment of the Council a variation
to this provision will provide a better street and lot layout.
9.Â Â Â All lots shall conform to the yard requirements of the zoning ordinance
for the zone in which the lot is located.

pursuant to the requirements of the zoning ordinance.
12.Â Â Â Lots on cul-de-sacs shall contain the minimum area as required in said
lotâ€™s district in accordance with SUDAS.
170.20Â Â Â PARKS AND OPEN SPACE.
All subdivisions should be so designed as to meet the neighborhood park and
open space needs of their residents. The following standards and procedures
will be used to determine the park and open space requirements for all proposed
residential developments or subdivisions greater than half acre in size within
the City:
1.Â Â Â For all residential developments and subdivisions, the subdivider shall be
responsible for providing adequate park and open space in one or both of the
following ways, depending on the decision of the City.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If it is feasible and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan, as
determined by the Council upon the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and approved by the Council, the subdivider will be required to
dedicate and reserve an area for parks and open space, without cost to the
City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The amount of land shall be determined by first calculating the
entire size of the land area of the proposed development as shown on the
preliminary plat or site plan and then to require dedication or reservation of
five percent of this amount for parks and open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â This area shall be denoted on the final plat prior to approval of
the final plat.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where such dedication is not feasible or compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan, as determined by the Council upon recommendation of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the subdivider shall, in lieu thereof, pay to
the City a fee or combination of fee and land equivalent to the value of the
required dedication or reservation to be determined and used in the following
manner:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Council, upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall determine the size of the land area which it would have
required to set aside for parks and open space (five percent of the total land
area).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The cash value of said land shall be determined by taking the total
purchase price or cost of all the land in the proposed subdivision and charge
the owner the proportionate value of the land area so designated, based upon
such purchase price or cost, provided such purchase price or cost is the
current fair and reasonable value of the land. If such purchase price or cost
does not reflect the current fair value of the land, the fair value of said
land shall be determined by an impartial appraisal, and in such manner as may
be designated by the Council, cost for said appraisal shall be paid the
subdivider.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All funds so levied, assessed, and collected by the City shall be
deposited in a special fund to be known as the â€œSpecial Fund for the
Acquisition and Development of Public Service Areas, Open Space and
Recreational Facilities,â€ and that said funds so levied and collected shall be
used for such purposes at such places and in such a manner as shall be
approved, ordered and directed by a recreation committee appointed by the
Council. Any interest accumulated upon such funds shall be added to the
â€œSpecial Fundâ€ and be used only for acquisition and development of open space
and recreational facilities.
2.Â Â Â At the time of the preliminary plat approval, the Council, upon
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall determine whether
to require a dedication of land within the subdivision or the payment of a fee,
in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, from the subdivider, for parks and
open space.
3.Â Â Â Where a dedication is required, it shall be accomplished with a properly
executed warranty deed dedicating the required land to the City without cost to
the City. Where a fee, in lieu of dedication is required, the fee shall be
deposited with the Clerk. Whichever action is required, it shall be
accomplished prior to the approval of the final plat.
4.Â Â Â The determination by the City of whether to require dedication of land, or
a fee, in lieu thereof, shall be based on the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Recreational element of the Cityâ€™s Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Topographic and geologic conditions and access and location of land in
subdivision available for dedication.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The relation of the subdivision to the Comprehensive Plan map,
particularly as such plan map may show proposed public service areas, open
space, and recreational areas.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The character and recreational needs of the neighborhood in which the
subdivision is located.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The unsuitability in the subdivision for open space and recreational
purposes by reason of location, access, greater cost of development and
maintenance.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The possibility that land immediately adjoining the subdivision will
serve in whole or in part the public service area, open space, and recreational
needs of such subdivision.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any and all other information relevant to a proper determination.
The determination of the Council as to whether land shall be dedicated or
reserved or a fee be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and
conclusive.
170.21Â Â Â PARKS SITES RESERVED.
When a tract being subdivided includes lands proposed to be parks in the
Comprehensive Plan or other official plan of the City, the subdivider shall
indicate such areas on the plat.
1.Â Â Â Proposed park sites shall be reserved for three years, giving the City or
other authorized public agency the option to purchase the land at the appraised
raw land value prior to the subdivision as established by a certified land
appraiser. The purchase price shall also include one-half of the cost for
grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any streets that are
contiguous to the site and any taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider
between the date of reservation and date of purchase by the public agency.
Should the park site not be purchased within three years, the subdivider may
then amend the final plat.
170.22Â Â Â NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
1.Â Â Â General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purpose, the layout of the subdivision with respect to
such land may be subject to additional provisions as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in City plans
and regulations.
2.Â Â Â Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel, and block pattern proposed are specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Proposed industrial or commercial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions pursuant to those stated in the zoning ordinance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the
type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and stormwater
drainage.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
170.23Â Â Â PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.

plat.
170.26Â Â Â SUBDIVISION CLASSIFIED.
Any proposed subdivision shall be classified as a minor subdivision or a major
subdivision.
1.Â Â Â Minor Subdivision. Any subdivision that contains not more than four lots
fronting on an existing street and that does not require construction of any
public improvements, and that does not adversely affect the remainder of the
parcel shall be classified as a minor plat.
2.Â Â Â Major Subdivision. Any subdivision that, in the opinion of the Council,
does not for any reason meet the definition of a minor subdivision, shall be

constructed or installed until and unless the plans, profiles, cross sections,
and specifications for the construction of such improvement have been submitted
to and approved in writing by, the City Engineer and all necessary permits have
been issued from the appropriate State and federal agencies (i.e., Iowa
Department of Natural Resources).
170.32Â Â Â TRANSFER OF LOTS WITHOUT CONSTRUCTING IMPROVEMENTS.
In the event the subdivider, its assigns, or successors in interest should
transfer lots in a subdivision without having constructed or installed the
pavement, water mains, sanitary sewer, storm sewers, sidewalks, or other public
improvements, the City shall have the right to install and construct such
improvements and the costs of such improvements shall be a lien and charge
against all the lots adjacent to or in front of which the improvements are made
and lots which may be assessed for improvements under the provisions of Chapter
384 of the Code of Iowa. The assessment for such improvements need not meet the
requirements of notice, benefit, or value as provided by State law for
assessing such improvements. In addition, the requirement to construct such
improvements is, and shall remain, a lien on all property located within the
subdivision until properly released by the City.
170.33Â Â Â COMPLETION AND ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the foregoing
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet the City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between the subdivider and the
City.
170.34Â Â Â REQUIREMENT FOR DEVELOPERâ€™S AGREEMENT.
It is required for a developerâ€™s agreement at the preliminary plat stage, with
a review draft executed with each final plat.
170.35Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND PERMITTED.
In lieu of the requirement that improvements be completed prior to the approval
of a final plat, the subdivider may post a performance bond with the City,
guaranteeing that improvements not completed shall be completed within a period
of two years from the date of approval of such final plat; but such approval of
the plat shall not constitute final acceptance of any improvements to be
constructed. Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has
been completed.
170.36Â Â Â REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.
The subdivider shall, within one year from the date of approval of the
preliminary plat, unless such time period has been extended or a performance
bond posted subject to Section
170.35, prepare and file with the Clerk, ten copies plus one electronic copy of
the final plat and required attachments, as set forth in this ordinance. Except
for a final plat for a minor subdivision as set forth herein, no final plat
shall be considered by the Council until and unless a preliminary plat for the
area included in the proposed final plat has been approved and has not expired
and become void as set forth above. The final plat shall be drawn at a scale of
one inch equals 100 feet or larger. Sheet size shall be no greater than 18
inches by 24 inches nor smaller than eight and one-half inches by 11 inches and
shall be of a size acceptable to the County Auditor. If more than one sheet is
used, each sheet shall clearly show the number of the sheet, the total number
of sheets included in the plat, and match lines indicating where other sheets

Chapter 355, Code of Iowa.
7.Â Â Â All adjoining properties shall be identified, and where such adjoining
properties are a part of a recorded subdivision, the name of the subdivision
shall be shown. If the subdivision platted is part of a previously recorded
subdivision, sufficient ties shall be shown to controlling lines appearing on
the earlier plat to permit an overlay to be made.
8.Â Â Â Street names and clear designation of public alleys.
9.Â Â Â Block and lot numbers.

170.37Â Â Â VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
The following shall apply to the granting of variances or exceptions:
1.Â Â Â Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations, except those required by State law, so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that
such variation or exceptions to these regulations meets the following criteria:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were carried out.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
make more money out of the property.
2.Â Â Â Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions, the Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3.Â Â Â Procedure for Variance. A petition for any such variation or exception
shall be submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary
plat is filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application
and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
170.38Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council, provided that such changes and amendments shall not become
effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice of which
shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments shall first
be submitted to the Planning Commission for study and recommendation before the
hearing date is scheduled. The Planning Commission shall forward its
recommendation to the Council within 30 days or a reasonable amount of time set
forth by the Council after the Council requests the recommendation. The Council
shall then give notice of and hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
