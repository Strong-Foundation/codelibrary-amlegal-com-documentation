46.04 CURFEW.
   This matter comes before the Creston City Council and the Council has
determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the public health,
safety, moral and general welfare of the City and specifically to reinforce the
primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for minors; to
protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after the curfew
hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity that
prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:

requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury or loss of
life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge which a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of sixteen (16)
years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six (6) hours without the oral or written order of a judge
or magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which
are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
   2.   Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon
any of the alleys, streets or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. daily
Sunday through Thursday; and between the hours of 12:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
daily Friday and Saturday.
   3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:

         (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or

of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, after the end or before the
beginning of the activity.
      E.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      F.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,

that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any non-secured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at

EDITOR’S NOTE
A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is included in the
appendix of this Code of Ordinances.
Caution is urged in the use of this administrative abatement procedure,
particularly where cost of abatement is more than minimal or where there is
doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does in fact exist. If compliance is not
secured following notice and hearings, we recommend you review the situation
with your attorney before proceeding with abatement and assessment of costs.
Your attorney may recommend proceedings in court under Chapter 657 of the Code
of Iowa rather than this procedure.

animal as defined in this section, then the Mayor or his designee shall order

upon the person or entity by personal service or registered mail.

of seven (7) days. If at the end of the impoundment period the person or entity
against whom the order has been entered has not petitioned the Iowa District
Court of Union County for further review of the order, the Mayor or designee

into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority
may employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private
entity, equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving,
storing, or disposing of abandoned vehicles. A property owner or other person
in control of private property may employ a private entity which is a garage
keeper (any operator of a parking place or establishment, motor vehicle storage
facility, or establishment for the servicing, repair, or maintenance of motor
vehicles) to dispose of an abandoned vehicle, and the private entity may take
into custody the abandoned vehicle without a police authority’s initiative. If
a police authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles,

number of the vehicle, describe the personal property found in the vehicle, set
forth the location of the facility where the vehicle is being held, and inform
the persons receiving the notice of their right to reclaim the vehicle and
personal property within ten (10) days after the effective date of the notice
upon payment of all towing, preservation, and storage charges resulting from
placing the vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The

to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity

or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,
title, claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders or claimants after the
expiration of the ten-day reclaiming period.

   If the identity of the last registered owner cannot be determined, or if the
registration contains no address for the owner, or if it is impossible to
determine with reasonable certainty the identity and addresses of all
lienholders, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation
in the area where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all
requirements of notice under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05 EXTENSION OF TIME.

police authority or private entity prior to the expiration of the ten (10) day
reclaiming period, obtain an additional five (5) days within which the motor
vehicle or personal property may be reclaimed.

not the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall
dispose of the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.08 DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.
   The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is found
any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle
whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two (2) or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.

a permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the user’s
existing permit.
   5.   Permit Transfer. Wastewater contribution permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not
be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises or a new or changed operation without the approval of the City. Any
succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the
existing permit.
95.32 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   The following reports are required for wastewater contribution permit
holders:
   1.   Compliance Date Report. Within 90 days following the effective date of
an applicable pretreatment standard, any user subject to the pretreatment
standard shall submit to the Public Works Director a report indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by pretreatment standards and the average and maximum
daily flow for these process units in the user’s facility which are limited by
such pretreatment standards. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into
compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified to
by a qualified professional.
   2.   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      A.   Any significant industrial user shall submit to the Public Works
Director during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Public Works Director, a
report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period
exceeded the average daily flow. At the discretion of the Public Works Director
and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, etc., the Public Works Director may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted.
      B.   The Public Works Director may impose mass limitations on users which
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards, or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the
report required by subsection A of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production
and mass, where requested by the Public Works Director, of pollutants contained
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. All
analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the
approval authority pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40
CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved
by the approval authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the approval authority.
   3.   Categorical Pretreatment Standard — Baseline Report. Within 180 days
after the effective date of a categorical Pretreatment Standard, or 180 days
after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination
submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial
users subject to such categorical Pretreatment Standards and currently
discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the treatment works shall be
required to submit to the Public Works Director a report which contains the
information required under 40 CFR 403.13(b)(1)-(7). Where reports containing
this information already have been submitted to the State or EPA in compliance
with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be
required to submit this information again. At least 90 days prior to
commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical Standard, shall be
required to submit to the Public Works Director a report which contains the
information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(5). New sources shall also be
required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment
the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New
sources shall give estimates of the information requested in 40 CFR 403.12(b)
(4) and (5).
95.33 APPLICATION SIGNATORIES AND CERTIFICATION.
   All wastewater discharge permit applications and industrial user reports
must contain the following certification statement and be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user.
“I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direct supervision in accordance with a system designed to
assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
95.34 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   All significant industrial users shall be required to provide and operate at
their own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and
flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles. There will be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility and all sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring
facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City’s requirements and all
applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall
be completed within 90 days following written notification by the City.
95.35 TESTING METHODS.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with methods specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and shall be determined at
the monitoring facility provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said
monitoring facility. In the event that no special monitoring facility has been
required, the monitoring facility shall be considered to the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.
95.36 PRETREATMENT.
   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply
with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be
provided, operated, and maintained continuously and in satisfactory and
effective operation at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City
for review, and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the
facilities. Design and installation of such facilities shall be subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the City under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the City prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.
The City shall annually publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the
City a list of the users which were in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment requirements or standards during the 12 previous months. The
notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the
user during the same 12 months.
95.37 UNUSUAL DISCHARGES — SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.
Special arrangements shall not be allowed which will cause violation of
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or NPDES permit.
95.38 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public without restriction unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. When requested
by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State Disposal System permit and/
or the Pretreatment Programs. Wastewater monitoring results will not be
recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the City as
confidential will be provided to the State and EPA upon request without prior
notification to the user.
95.39 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   A user is subject to having his/her wastewater contribution permit revoked
for any of the following conditions:
   1.   Failure of a user to report factually the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of the discharge;
   2.   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
   3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or,
   4.   Violation of conditions of the permit.
95.40 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATIONS.
   Whenever the City finds that any user has violated or is violating this
chapter, wastewater contribution permit, or any prohibition, limitation or
requirement contained herein, the City may serve upon such person a written
notice stating the nature of the violation. Within a specified period of the
date of the written notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof
shall be submitted to the City by the user.
95.41 HARMFUL CONTRIBUTIONS.
   The City may suspend wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater
contribution permit of a user when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion
of the City, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents
or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare
of persons or environment, causes interference to the treatment works or causes
the City to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit. Any user notified of a
suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or its wastewater contribution
permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of
failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the treatment works or
endangerment to any individuals. The City shall reinstate the wastewater
contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service, upon payment to
the City of all costs of such disconnection and reconnection and upon proof of
the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City
within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
95.42 DAMAGING OR TAMPERING WITH SEWAGE WORKS.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or
equipment which is a part of the sewage works. Any person violating the
provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
95.43 INSPECTION OF PROPERTIES.
   1.   Authorized Official; Jurisdiction. The City may inspect the facilities
of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and
all requirements are being complied with. Owners or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City or its representative
ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records or in the
performance of any of their duties. The City shall have the right to set up on
the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the City will be permitted to enter, without
delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
   2.   Deaths Or Damages; Liability. While performing the necessary work on
private properties referred to in Section
95.43, the Public Works Director or duly authorized employees of the City shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company,
and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to City employees.
The City shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by
City employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or
property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and
sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of
the company to maintain safe conditions.
   3.   Easements. The Public Works Director and other duly authorized
employees of the City bearing proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter all private properties through which the City holds a duly
negotiated easement for the purpose of, but not limited to, inspection,

96.01 COMPREHENSIVE SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
   Every person whose premises is served by connection to the Sanitary Sewer
System of the City, either directly or indirectly, shall pay to the City a
comprehensive sewer service charge for the use of and for services supplied by
the Water Pollution Control Facilities of the City, which charges consist of:
   1.   Basic user charge for the O & M of the Water Pollution Control Plant.
   2.   A surcharge for the O & M of the Water Pollution Control Plant for
wastes contributed of strengths greater than domestic wastewater.
   3.   A basic user charge for the O & M of the Sanitary Sewer System.
   4.   A billing and collection charge.
   5.   A debt service charge.
   6.   An industrial cost recovery charge, where applicable.
96.02 ACCOUNTS ESTABLISHED.
   That portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for
operation and maintenance including replacement purposes, shall be deposited in
a separate non-lapsing fund known as the Operation, Maintenance and Replacement
Fund and will be kept in two primary accounts as follows:
   1.   Operation and Maintenance Account. An account designated for the
specific purpose of defraying operation and maintenance costs (excluding
replacement) of the treatment works.
   2.   Replacement Account. An account designated for the specific purpose of
ensuring replacement needs over the useful life of the treatment works.
Deposits in the Replacement Account shall be made at least annually from the
Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Fund.
96.03 YEAR-END BALANCES.
   Fiscal year-end balances in the Operation and Maintenance Account and the
Replacement Account shall be carried over to the same accounts in the
subsequent fiscal year, and shall be used for no other purposes than those
designated for these accounts. Moneys which have been transferred from other
sources to meet temporary shortages in the Operation, Maintenance and
Replacement Fund shall be returned to their respective accounts upon
appropriate adjustment of the user charge rates for operation, maintenance and
replacement. The user charge rate shall be adjusted such that the transferred
moneys will be returned to their respective accounts within the fiscal year
following the fiscal year in which the moneys were borrowed.
96.04 RATES.
   The rates for the comprehensive sewer service charge shall be established
every July by Council resolution and shall be as follows:
   1.   Water Pollution Control Plant. The basic user charge for the O & M cost
of the Water Pollution Control Plant shall be based on the total number of
services and on the quantity of flow of domestic wastewater recorded by water
meters. The plant O & M budget is composed of the following basic budget items:
      A.   Salaries and fringe benefits;
      B.   Insurance, conference and billing expenses;
      C.   Maintenance and operation of equipment and vehicles;
      D.   Buildings and grounds operating supplies and maintenance;
      E.   Utilities and laboratory expenses;
      F.   Reserve for payment of bonds and equipment replacement.
   2.   Unit Cost Charges/Water Pollution Control Plant. The unit cost for all
users shall be the sum of the unit cost for (a) flow, (b) B.O.D., and (c)
Suspended Solids per gallon multiplied by the flow from each user. The unit
cost for flow, B.O.D. and SS shall be determined as follows:
      A.   Reserve for unit flow costs, as applied for industrial waste —
$1.00/100 cu. ft.
      B.   Reserve for unit B.O.D. costs, as applied for industrial waste —
depending on industrial discharge set by Council.
      C.   Reserve for unit SS costs, as applied for industrial waste.
   3.   Surcharge. A surcharge for the O & M cost of the Water Pollution
Control Plant shall be collected from those users who contribute wastes with
strengths greater than domestic wastewater. These users shall be sampled and
the sample analyzed at least once per
quarter. A moving average of excess B.O.D. and SS, expressed in pounds, shall
be used to compute the quarterly surcharge.
      A.   Quarterly Excess B.O.D. The quarterly excess B.O.D., expressed in
mg/l, shall be calculated by subtracting the B.O.D. of domestic wastewater (250
mg/l) from the quarterly average B.O.D. of a user. If the value is less than
zero, zero shall be used to compute the moving average of excess B.O.D.
      B.   Moving Average Excess B.O.D. Value. The moving average of excess
B.O.D., expressed in pounds, shall be computed by adding the latest quarterly
excess B.O.D., expressed in pounds, to the previous three (3) quarters’ excess
B.O.D., expressed in pounds, and divided by four (4).
      C.   B.O.D. Surcharge Amount. The surcharge for B.O.D. shall be
calculated by multiplying the moving average excess B.O.D. value expressed in
pounds by the unit B.O.D. cost per pound as developed in subsection 2(B) of
this section.
      D.   Quarterly Excess SS.
   The quarterly excess SS, expressed in mg/l, shall be calculated by
subtracting the SS of domestic wastewater (250 mg/l) from the quarterly average
SS of a user. If the value is less than zero, zero shall be used to compute the
moving average of excess SS.
      E.   Moving Average Excess SS Value. The moving average of excess SS,
expressed in pounds, shall be computed by adding the latest quarterly excess
SS, expressed in pounds, to the previous three (3) quarters’ excess SS,
expressed in pounds, and divided by four (4).
      F.   SS Surcharge Amount. The surcharge for SS shall be calculated by
multiplying the moving average excess SS value expressed in pounds by the unit
SS cost per pound as developed in subsection 2(C) of this section.
   The total surcharge shall be a sum of the surcharge for B.O.D. and the
surcharge for SS.
   4.   Sanitary Sewer System. The basic user charge for the O & M of the
sanitary sewer system shall be based on the minimum monthly charge and on the
quantity of flow. The sanitary sewer system O & M budget is composed of the
following basic budget items:
      A.   Repair and maintenance of sewer lines;
      B.   Repair and maintenance of vehicles and equipment;
      C.   Reserve for future sewer extensions and equipment.
   5.   Unit Costs and Flow Charge/Sanitary Sewer System.
      A.   Unit Costs. The unit cost for flow shall be calculated by dividing
the anticipated budget by the quantity of flow billed to all users of the
sanitary sewer system.
      B.   Flow Charge. The charge for flow shall then be calculated by
multiplying the unit cost for flow by the users’ flow measured in cubic feet.
96.05 BILLING AND COLLECTION CHARGES.
   The cost of determining the amount due from each user and the collection of
the same shall be borne by the user. Each user shall be billed on a regular
basis, i.e., monthly or quarterly, for the amount of the comprehensive sewer
service charges. Such bill shall be part of a combined service account as
authorized by Section 384.84 of the Code of Iowa. Each regular bill shall be
increased by a charge to defray the cost of computing and mailing said bill.
The cost per bill will be determined by dividing the anticipated cost of
billing and collection by the total number of bills mailed to users.
96.06 DEBT SERVICE CHARGES.
   A debt service charge shall be collected to pay principal and interest as
they become due on bonds now issued and hereafter to be issued for sanitary
sewer purposes.
   1.   Unit Costs. The charge for the total annual debt service for such bonds
shall be based on quantity of flow recorded by meters. The unit costs for flow
shall be calculated by dividing the total debt service by the quantity of flow
billed to all users.
   2.   Flow Charges. The charge for flow shall then be calculated by
multiplying the unit cost for flow by the users’ flow measured in cubic feet.
That portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for debt
service shall be deposited in a separate non-lapsing fund known as the Sewer
Debt Service Fund. The funds shall be used to pay the principal and interest on
debt issued for sewer operations, maintenance and improvements. Fiscal year-end
balances in the sewer debt service fund shall be carried over to the same
account in the subsequent fiscal year, and shall be used for no other purpose
than the designated purpose of the fund. Moneys which have been transferred
from other sources to meet temporary shortages in the sewer debt service fund
shall be returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of
the user charge rates for sewer debt service. The user charge rate shall be
adjusted such that the transferred moneys will be returned to their respective
accounts within the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the moneys
were borrowed.
96.07 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY.
   1.   Rates. The rates to be charged each industrial user that contributes
process waste to the sanitary sewer system will be based on the total yearly
contribution from that user. A unit cost for flow, B.O.D. and SS shall be
computed as follows:
      F   =   Unit flow charge in dollars per $1.00/100 cu. ft.
      B   =   Unit B.O.D. charge in dollars per pound, set by industrial
discharge
      S   =   Unit SS charge in dollars per pound, set by industrial discharge
   2.   Monitoring and Review. Selected industrial users connected to the sewer
system shall be monitored by the City at least monthly, all others yearly, to
determine their hydraulic and organic contribution. The results of these tests,
if more than one is conducted, shall be averaged and used as the individual
industry’s total flow, B.O.D. and SS for the industrial cost recovery
computation. Prior to July 1 of each year, the City shall conduct a review to
determine what industrial users are connected to said system and therefore
subject to these charges.
   3.   Billing; Payment; Collection. All industrial users subject to this
section will be billed by the City in accordance with the terms and conditions
established by the Council for the industrial user. All payments of industrial
cost recovery charges shall be due and payable on or before one year from date
of billing. Any industrial users subject to this section may make arrangements

   There is hereby granted to Interstate Power and Light Company, hereinafter
referred to as the “Company,” its successors and assigns, the right, privilege
and non-exclusive franchise to acquire, construct, reconstruct, replace, erect,
maintain and operate in the City of Creston, Iowa, hereinafter called the
“City,” a system for the transmission and distribution of natural gas along,
under, over and upon the streets, avenues, rights of way, alleys, public places
or public grounds (excluding parks) to serve customers within the City, and to

of the Company.
The Company is granted the right to exercise of powers of eminent domain. At
least thirty (30) days prior to exercising its right to eminent domain, the
Company shall notify the City of its intent to exercise such right. This

Notes
2 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 21-198, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on April 20, 2021.
110.02 PLACEMENT.
   The mains and pipes of the Company must be so placed so as not to interfere
unnecessarily with water pipes, drains, sewers and fire plugs which have been
or may hereafter be placed in any street, alley and public places in said City
nor unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of the same, including ordinary
drainage, or with the sewers, underground pipe and other property of the City.
The Company, its successors and assigns shall hold the City free and harmless
from all damages arising from the negligent acts or omissions of the Company in
the laying down, operation and maintenance of the natural gas distribution
system.
110.03 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making any excavations in any street, alley, or public place, Company,
its successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in progress by
guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of the
streets, and shall back fill all openings in such manner as to prevent settling
or depressions in the surface, pavement or sidewalk of such excavations with
same materials, restoring the condition as nearly as practical and if defects
are caused shall repair the same. Company shall give reasonable advance notice
to the City before excavating in streets, avenues, alleys, or public places
within the City.
   In making excavations in the streets, avenues, or alleys the Company shall
proceed with such work as reasonably necessary to protect the public. The
Company shall properly protect the work, according to safety standards
generally accepted at the time of placement.
   As soon as reasonably possible after use any trenches for excavations which
the Company has opened shall be filled. All backfilling in streets, avenues, or
alleys will be according to City specifications. Pavements, sidewalks, curb and
gutters or other portions of streets, avenues, or alleys opened, disturbed or
damaged by Company shall be promptly restored and replaced with like materials
by the Company at its own expense and left in as good condition as before. In
the event like replacement materials are not available, the Company shall
notify the City which must approve the use of any alternate materials. In the
event the Company fails to restore the work area in compliance with this
section as promptly as practical, the City and Company shall meet within 10
days of written notice. If the parties agree in writing, the City may complete
the work at the expense of the Company. If other entities are party to the
excavation the costs of restoration shall be apportioned to all entities using
or enjoying the benefits of the excavation. In cases where a cut or disturbance
is made in a section of street paving or sidewalks, but causes greater
disturbance than simply to the area cut, rather than replace only the area cut,
the Company shall replace that area which in no event shall exceed the panel or
panels disturbed.
   Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade
line of any street or alley or shall construct or reconstruct any conduit,
water main service or water connection, sewer or other City owned public works,
it shall be the duty of the Company, except where easements of record are held
by the Company, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its lines and other
property in the streets, avenues, or alleys at its own expense so as to conform
to the established grade or line of such street or alley and so as not to
unnecessarily interfere with the public improvements so constructed or
reconstructed. If the grade line change is being done for a third-party
project, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocating its existing facilities or equipment.
   All entities owning and operating facilities in the public right-of-way,
including City-owned and operated facilities, shall be treated in a neutral
manner.

   The Company shall, at its cost, locate and relocate its existing facilities
or equipment in, on, over or under any public street or alley in the City in
such a manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for the purposes
of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the
street or alley or any public improvement thereof, in or about any such street
or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such
improvement. If the City requires the Company to relocate facilities in the
public right of way that have been relocated at Company expense at the
direction of the City during the previous three years, the reasonable costs of
such relocation will be paid by the City.
   If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment for any reason other than as specified above, or as the
result of the initial request for a commercial, private or other non-public
development, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation
as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or equipment.
   The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public
works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this section. The City
shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for the Company’s
facilities as part of its relocation request.
   Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right of way, or all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right of way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“Information”).
   The Company and City recognize the Information may in whole or part be
considered a confidential record under State or federal law or both. Therefore,
the City shall not release any Information without prior consent of the Company
and shall return the Information to Company upon request. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps or information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time. In the event any action at law, in equity, or administrative
is brought against the City regarding disclosure of any document which the
Company has designated as a trade secret or as otherwise protected from
disclosure, the Company shall cooperate with the City in its defense of
nondisclosure.
110.05 STREET VACATIONS.
   At least thirty (30) days prior to the City abandoning or vacating any
street, avenue, alley or public ground, the City shall notify the Company of
any such vacation. If the Company notifies the City within such thirty (30) day
timeframe that the Company has gas facilities, the City shall grant the Company
a utility easement for said facilities
110.06 QUALITY AND QUANTITY.
   Said Company, its successors and assigns, shall throughout the term of the
franchise distribute to all consumers gas of good quality and shall furnish
uninterrupted service, except as interruptible service may be specifically
contracted for with consumers; provided, however, that any prevention of
service caused by fire, act of God or unavoidable event or accident shall not
be a breach of this condition if the Company resumes service as quickly as is
reasonably practical after the happening of the act causing the interruption.
110.07 FRANCHISE FEE.
   There is hereby imposed a franchise fee of one percent (1%) upon the gross
revenue generated from sales of natural gas by the Company within the corporate
limits of the City. The Company shall begin collecting the franchise fee upon

bill to each customer. The Company shall remit franchise fee receipts to the
City no more frequently than on or before the last business day of the month
following each calendar year quarter.
   The franchise fee shall be applied to all customers’ bills in accordance
with Iowa Code Chapter 364.2(f), and 423B.5, as amended, and subject to any
modifications or the repeal of same. The Company shall not, under any
circumstances be required to return or refund any franchise fees that have been
collected from customers and remitted to the City. In the event the Company is
required to provide data or information in defense of the City’s imposition of
franchise fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying
customers or calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual
customers the City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the
Company to provide such data or information.

annexation, or changes in the City limits, the City Clerk shall provide written
notification to Company of such annexation or change in the limits of said

rules, regulations or law.

114.01 ADMINISTRATION OF RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The City has the legal authority to administer and shall enforce against any
non-municipally owned cable television system operator, as permitted therein,
the provisions of Part 76, Subpart N of the Rules and Regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), concerning Cable Rate Regulation, 47
C.F.R. §§76.900 et. seq., as they currently read and hereafter may be amended,
which are herewith incorporated by reference.
114.02 RATE REGULATION PROCEEDINGS.
   Any rate regulation proceedings conducted under Section
114.01 shall provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of
any interested party, including but not limited to, the City or its designee,
the Cable Operator, subscribers, and residents of the franchise area. In
addition to all other provisions required by the laws of the State of Iowa and
by the City, and in order to provide for such opportunity for consideration of
the views of any interested party, the City shall take the following actions:
   1.   The City shall publish notice as provided in Section 362.4 of the Code
of Iowa and shall mail, by certified mail, to the Cable Operator a notice of
the intent to conduct a public proceeding on basic service tier rates and/or
charges for equipment to receive such basic service tier, as defined by the
FCC.
   2.   The public notice shall state, among other things, that cable
television rates are subject to municipal review and explain the nature of the
rate review in question; that any interested party has a right to participate
in the proceeding; that public views may be submitted in the proceeding,
explaining how they are to be submitted and the deadline for submitting any
such views; that a decision concerning the reasonableness of the cable
television rates in question will be governed by the Rules and Regulations of
the FCC; and that the decision of the City is subject to review by the FCC.
   3.   The City shall conduct a public proceeding to determine whether or not
the rates or proposed rate increases are reasonable. The City may delegate by
resolution the responsibility to conduct the proceeding to any duly qualified
and eligible individual(s) or entity. If the City or its designee cannot
determine the reasonableness of a proposed rate increase within the time period
permitted by the FCC Rules and Regulations, it may announce the effective date
of the proposed rates for an additional period of time as permitted by the FCC
Rules and Regulations, and issue any other necessary or appropriate order and
give public notice accordingly.
   4.   In the course of the rate regulation proceeding, the City may request
additional information from the Cable Operator that is reasonably necessary to
determine the reasonableness of the basic service tier rates and equipment
charges. Any such additional information submitted to the City shall be
verified by an appropriate official of the cable television system supervising
the preparation of the response on behalf of the entity, and submitted by way
of affidavit or under penalty of perjury, stating that the response is true and
accurate to the best of that person’s knowledge, information and belief formed
after reasonable inquiry.
   5.   The City may request proprietary information, provided that the City
shall consider a timely request from the Cable Operator that said proprietary
information shall not be made available for public information, consistent with
the procedures set forth in Section 0.459 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.
Furthermore, said proprietary information may be used only for the purpose of
determining the reasonableness of the rates and charges or the appropriate rate
level based on a cost-of-service showing submitted by the Cable Operator.
   6.   The City may exercise all powers under the laws of the State of Iowa
and by this Code of Ordinances to discover any information relevant to the rate
regulation proceeding, including, but not limited to, subpoena,
interrogatories, production of documents, and deposition.
   7.   Upon termination of the rate regulation proceeding, the City shall
adopt by resolution and release a written decision as to whether or not the
rates or proposed rate increase are reasonable or unreasonable, and, if
unreasonable, its remedy, including prospective rate reduction, rate
prescription, and refunds.
   8.   The City may not impose any fines, penalties, forfeitures or other
sanctions, other than permitted by the FCC Rules and Regulations, for charging
an unreasonable rate or proposing an unreasonable rate increase.
   9.   Consistent with FCC Rules and Regulations, the City’s decision may be
reviewed only by the FCC.
   10.   The City shall be authorized, at any time, whether or not in the
course of a rate regulation proceeding, to gather information as necessary to
exercise its jurisdiction as authorized by the laws of the State of Iowa, the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the FCC Rules and Regulations. Any
information submitted to the City shall be verified by an appropriate official
of the cable television system supervising the preparation of the response on
behalf of the entity, and submitted by way of affidavit or under penalty of
perjury, stating that the response is true and accurate to the best of that
person’s knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry.
114.03 CERTIFICATION TO FCC AND CABLE OPERATOR.
   The City filed with the FCC the required certification form (FCC Form 328)
and notified the Cable Operator that the City has been certified by the FCC and
that it has adopted all necessary regulations so as to begin regulating basic
service tier cable television rates and equipment charges.
114.04 CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICE TIER.
   With regard to the cable programming service tier, as defined by the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the FCC Rules and Regulations, and
over which the City is not empowered to exercise rate regulation, the Cable
Operator shall give notice to the City of any change in rates for the cable
programming service tier or tiers, any change in the charge for equipment
required to receive the tier or tiers, and any changes in the nature of the
services provided, including the program services included in the tier or
tiers. Said notice shall be provided within five (5) business days after the
change becomes effective.
114.05 DELEGATION OF POWERS PERMITTED.
   The City may delegate by resolution its powers to enforce this chapter to
municipal employees or officers (the “cable official”). The cable official will
have the authority to:
   1.   Administer oaths and affirmations;
   2.   Issue subpoenas;
   3.   Examine witnesses;

television system in the City as permitted by the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Upon review of the customer service
standards adopted by the FCC on March 11, 1993, by MM Docket No. 92-263 of the
FCC, and deeming it in the best interests of the City, the Council hereby
adopted by reference the above mentioned customer service standards.
114.07 RULES AND PROCEDURES.

remedy possible violations of the customer service standards by the Cable
Operator. The Council shall provide for notice and opportunity for hearing for
both the customers and the Cable Operator in such process.
114.08 REDUCTION OF RATE.
   If after notice and opportunity for hearing, the City determines that the
Cable Operator is not in complete compliance with all the provisions of the
customer service standards, the Cable Operator shall reduce the rate for the
basic tier of cable service by ten percent (10%) until such time that the City
has been satisfied that the Cable Operator is in compliance with all the
provisions of the customer service standards. In addition, the Cable Operator
shall pay to the City the sum of $100.00 for each day that the Cable Operator
fails to be in compliance with all the provisions of the standards after the
date that the Council has passed a resolution stipulating the sections where
the Cable Operator is in noncompliance.

Notes
4 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 22-07, adopting an Electric Transmission Line
  Franchise for the City, was passed and adopted on March 1, 2022.
116.02 INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily
interfere with the travel on the streets, avenues, and public places in the
City nor unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of the same, including
ordinary drainage, or with the sewers, underground pipe and other property of
the City, and the Company shall hold the City free and harmless from all
damages arising from the negligent acts or omissions of the Company in the
erection or maintenance of the transmission system.
   The Company shall indemnify, defend and hold City harmless from and against
any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, cost and expenses (including, but
not limited to, court costs, fines, penalties and reasonable attorneys’ fees,
but excluding consequential or indirect damages), judgements, liabilities and
causes of action of any nature whatsoever resulting from or relating to its
negligent acts or omissions in the use or occupancy of the streets, avenues,
alleys and public ways in the City, a default of this franchise, or arising in
any manner out of the negligent acts or omissions of its agents, employees, or
contractors in connection with same, or with respect to the violation of any
laws, including without limitation, any environmental laws.
   The requirements of indemnification shall not be a waiver of any right that
the City would have to assert defenses on its own behalf under State or federal
law. To the extent authorized by law, in consideration of this indemnification,
the City will affirmatively assert all applicable defenses, including without
limitation those of governmental immunity, that it has in any given
circumstance that may give rise to a claim for indemnification under this
section. The Company’s indemnification obligations under this franchise shall
survive the expiration, cancellation, or termination of this franchise in
accordance with applicable statutes of limitation in force within the State of
Iowa.
116.03 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making any excavations in any street, alley, or public place, Company,
its successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in progress by
guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of the
streets, and shall back fill all openings in such manner as to prevent settling
or depressions in surface, pavement or sidewalk of such excavations with same
materials, restoring the condition as nearly as practicable and, if defects are
caused, shall repair the same. Except for events of an emergency, Company shall
give reasonable advance notice to the City before excavating in streets,
avenues, alleys, or public places within the City.
   In making excavations in the streets, avenues, or alleys the Company shall
proceed with such work as reasonably necessary to protect the public. The
Company shall properly protect the work, according to safety standards
generally accepted at the time of placement.
   As soon as reasonably possible after use, any trenches for excavations which
the Company has opened shall be filled. All backfilling in streets, avenues, or
alleys will be according to City specifications. Pavements, sidewalks, curb and
gutters or other portions of streets, avenues, or alleys opened, disturbed or
damaged by Company shall be promptly restored and replaced with like materials
by the Company at its own expense and left in as good condition as before. In
the event like replacement materials are not available, the Company shall
notify the City which must approve the use of any alternate materials. In the
event the company fails to restore the work area in accordance with this
section as promptly as is practical, the City and Company shall meet within 10
days of written notice. If the parties agree in writing, the City may complete
the work at the expense of the Company.
   If other entities are party to the excavation the costs of restoration shall
be apportioned to all entities using or enjoying the benefits of the
excavation. In cases where a cut or disturbance is made in a section of street
paving or sidewalks, but causes greater disturbance than simply to the area
cut, rather than replace only the area cut, the Company shall replace that area
of disturbance, which in no event shall exceed the panel(s) disturbed. Whenever
the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade line of any
street or alley or shall construct or reconstruct any conduit, water main
service or water connection, sewer or other City owned public works, it shall
be the duty of the Company, except where easements of record are held by the
Company, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its lines and other property
in the streets, avenues, or alleys at its own expense so as to conform to the
established grade or line of such street or alley and so as not to
unnecessarily interfere with the public improvements so constructed or
reconstructed. If the grade line change is being done for a third-party
project, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocating its existing facilities or equipment.
   All entities owning and operating facilities in the public right-of-way,
including City-owned and operated facilities, shall be treated in a neutral
manner.
116.04 RELOCATION.
   Except as provided herein below, the Company shall, at its cost and expense,
locate and relocate its Facilities in, on or over any public street or alley in
the City in such a manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for
the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or
repair of the street or alley or any public improvement of, in or about any
such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any
such improvement. If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its
Facilities for, or causes the need for relocation for public or private
development, then the primary benefit of a commercial or private project, or as
the result of the initial request of a commercial or private developer or other
non-public entity, the Company shall receive payment for the costs of such
relocation as a precondition to relocating its Facilities. The City shall
consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works projects so as
not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable additional expense in
exercising its authority under this section. The City shall also provide a
reasonable alternate location for the Company’s Facilities. The City shall give
the Company reasonable advance written notice to vacate a public right-of-way.
Vacating a public right-of-way shall not deprive the Company of its right to
operate and maintain existing Facilities until the reasonable cost of
relocating the same are paid to the Company.
   Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right of way, or all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right of way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“Information”). The
Company and City recognize the Information may in whole or part be considered a
confidential record under State or federal law or both. Therefore, the City
shall not release any Information without prior consent of the Company and
shall return the Information to Company upon request. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps or information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time. In the event any action at law, in equity, or administrative
is brought against the City regarding disclosure of any document which the
Company has designated as a trade secret or as otherwise protected from
disclosure, the Company shall cooperate with the City in its defense of
nondisclosure.
116.05 MODERN SYSTEM.
   The system authorized by this ordinance shall be kept in an operable
condition consistent with good utility practice and the reliability standards
of the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC). The Company shall
construct and maintain its transmission facilities in accordance with
applicable law. The Company will maintain compliance with State and federal
regulatory standards.
116.06 VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.
   To promote public safety in proximity to its Facilities and to maintain
electric reliability, the Company is authorized and empowered to remove, cut,
trim, destroy, or otherwise control any tree, shrub, brush, bush, or any parts
thereof located within or extending into any street, alley, right-of-way or
public grounds. The foregoing vegetation management shall be completed in
accordance with the most current nationally accepted safety and utility
industry standards, as revised and updated from time to time.
116.07 CONTINUOUS SERVICE.
   Service to be rendered by the Company under this franchise shall be
continuous unless prevented from doing so by fire, Acts of God, unavoidable
accidents or casualties, or reasonable interruptions necessary to properly
service the Company’s equipment, and in such event service shall be resumed as
promptly as reasonably possible in accordance with Good Utility Practice, as
defined by FERC Order 888 in Section 1.14 of the Pro Forma Open Access
Transmission Tariff.
116.08 NON-EXCLUSIVITY.
   The franchise granted by this ordinance shall not be exclusive.
116.09 UNDERGROUNDING.
   The City may request estimates for the undergrounding of replacement lines,
upgrades or new lines, including lines to be adjusted for road moves or for
other specific projects. When requested, the Company will provide to the City
two estimates: 1) an estimate for the cost of the project with overhead
construction, and 2) an estimate for the cost of the project with underground
construction. The City will have no more than 60 days from the estimate date to
determine if it wants the line built overhead or placed underground. If the
City chooses underground construction for such project, the City will be
responsible for the incremental cost of undergrounding, if and to the extent,
such costs are not already part of or included in a precondition payment for
relocation pursuant to Section
116.04. The incremental cost of undergrounding is defined as the differential
between the estimate for underground construction and the estimate for overhead
construction. Upon receipt of the City’s payment for the incremental cost of
undergrounding, the Company will install the underground facilities. The
Company reserves the right to bill City for the amount that the incremental
cost associated with installation exceeds its estimate. The City reserves the
right to a refund of overpayment if the incremental costs are less than the
amount billed in the estimate. If the City wishes to have a line not scheduled
for replacement or upgrade placed underground, the City shall contact the
Company to make such a request. The City shall cover all costs related to this
work. If undergrounding of transmission lines requires entities interconnecting
with the Company to make adjustments to their electrical systems, the City
bears the responsibility of communication with those entities and, if it
chooses, the cost of converting their facilities from overhead to underground.
The Company reserves the right to review all the City’s communications with the
affected entities.
116.10 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, provision, or part of this ordinance shall be adjudged to be
invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of
the ordinance as a whole or any section, provision, or part thereof not
adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.
116.11 TERM OF AGREEMENT.
   The term of the franchise granted by this ordinance and the rights granted
thereunder shall continue for the period of twenty-five (25) years from and
after written acceptance by the Company.
116.12 PUBLICATION EXPENSES.
   The expense of the publication of this ordinance shall be paid by the
company.
116.13 REPEAL OF CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   All ordinances, or parts of ordinances, insofar as they are in direct
conflict wherewith, are hereby repealed.
116.14 ACCEPTANCE.
   The franchise granted by this ordinance shall be conditioned upon acceptance
by the Company in writing. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk
within ninety (90) days from the passage of this ordinance.
116.15 CLOSING.
   This ordinance sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement between the
Company and the City with respect to the rights contained herein, and may not
be superseded, modified or otherwise amended without the approval and
acceptance of the Company. In no event shall the City act in any manner, by
ordinance or otherwise, to effectively unilaterally amend this agreement. Upon
acceptance by the Company, this ordinance shall supersede, abrogate and repeal
any prior electric system ordinance between the Company and the City as of the
date this ordinance is accepted by the Company.

contain a detectable warning surface, and shall otherwise be so constructed as
to allow reasonable access to the crosswalk for persons with disabilities using
the sidewalk. All sidewalk improvements on public property whether performed by
the owner of the abutting property or by the City, shall be performed under the

improvements are made without a permit, the City Engineer shall serve notice to
obtain a permit upon the property owner and upon the contractor doing the work.
If the sidewalk is in the course of construction, the notice shall order the
work to stop until a permit is obtained and the work is corrected to comply
with the specifications. If the sidewalk work has been completed, the owner

five (5) days from receipt of the permit. If the owner fails to comply with
this notice, the engineer shall have the work completed and the costs assessed
to the property owner.

effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed shall comply
therewith immediately.

and fire safety, or structural requirements. The details of action granting
modifications shall be recorded and entered in the rental inspection files.
147.26 CITY LIABILITY.
   The City or any employee is not liable for damages to a person or property
as a result of any act or failure to act in the enforcement of this Code. This
Code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any
person owning, operating or controlling any equipment or structure regulated
herein for damages to a person or property caused by its defects, nor shall the
City of any City employee be held as assuming any such liability by reason of
the inspections authorized by this Code or any approvals issued under this
Code.
147.27 CIVIL LIABILTIY.
   The owner of any rental property or of any building or structure upon the
same lot with a rental property, or of the lot, or any violation of this
chapter or where a nuisance as defined in this Code of Ordinances exists, who
has been guilty of such violation or of creating or knowingly permitting the
existence of such violation, or any occupant who shall violate or assist in
violating any provisions of this chapter, shall also jointly and severally for
each such violation and each such nuisance be subject to a civil penalty to be
recovered for the use of the City in a civil action brought in the name of the
City by the rental inspector. Such person or persons and also the premises
shall be liable in such case for all costs, expenses, and disbursements paid or
incurred by the City and rental inspector including attorney’s fees, paid or
incurred by the City, by any officers, agents, or employees thereof, in the
removal of any such nuisance or violation.

penalty. For the recovery of such penalties, costs, expenses or disbursement,
an action may be brought in the courts of Union County.

owner or owner’s representative of a property who wishes to make an appeal
regarding a notice of violation of their rental property or unit(s) shall
complete an appeal form provided by the City of Creston. This appeal must be
filed with the City Clerk within 30 days of the initial inspection. The Board
of Adjustment shall then schedule a hearing within 45 days of receiving the
appeal.
   1.   Variances. In the case of appeals requesting a variance, the Board may
grant a reasonable variance in a specific case and from specific provision of
this chapter, subject, however, to appropriate conditions, and provided that,
the Board makes specific findings of fact based on the evidence presented on
the record, that the following factors have been established by the required
standard of proof:
      A.   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
carrying out the strict letter of the notice or order.
      B.   Due to the circumstances presented, the effect of the application of
the provisions of this chapter would be arbitrary in the specific case.
      C.   An extension of time to bring the property into compliance with the
provisions of this chapter would not constitute an appropriate remedy for these
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in this arbitrary effect.
      D.   Such a variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this chapter in securing the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      E.   The granting of such variance will not render the structure unsafe
for habitation.
      F.   The structure being benefited by the variance conformed with all
applicable provisions of the Code of Ordinances, including, but not limited to,
zoning regulations, at each of the following times; at time of construction, at
the time of its conversion to rental dwelling status, and at the time of any
increase in number of rental dwelling units in the structure.
   2.   Open Meetings. Hearings conducted under this section shall be open to
the public during presentation of testimony and other evidence and during any
argument or discussion the Board may permit. Upon completion of the submission
of evidence, the Board shall make findings and determination thereon. The Board
may request assistance from the City Attorney in formalizing its findings and
determinations, which shall be issued in written form. Findings and
determination shall be made no later than 30 days after the hearing.
   3.   Appeal of Decision. The party who is appealing or the City may appeal
the decision of the Board to a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days
of the date of the decision of the Board. If the decision of the Board is not
appealed, it shall become final.
   4.   Recorded. Variances issued by the Board shall be recorded on the City’s
rental file for the property.
147.30 VIOLATIONS.
   Rental properties and/or rental units that fail to comply with the rental
housing inspection program, shall be referred to the City Building Official and
Attorney for prosecution as a municipal infraction. Failure to comply with this
program, including but not limited to failure to register a property or make
any required improvements or repairs, may result in the revocation of a
Certificate of Occupancy and/or a requirement to vacate the property.

designated by the City Council, shall be responsible for the enforcement of
this Building Code. The Administrative Official shall be accountable for the
issuance of all applicable permits under this Building Code, which shall
include building permits issued in compliance with the City’s Zoning Code. The
Administrative Official shall have the power to render interpretations of this
Building Code and to adopt and enforce rules and regulations supplemental to
this Building Code, subject to the approval of the Council, as they may deem
necessary in order to clarify the application of the provisions of this
Building Code. Such interpretations, rules, and regulations shall be in
conformity with the intent and purpose of this Building Code.

   Pursuant to published notice and public hearing, as required by law, the

responsibility to schedule the required inspections and obtain final approvals.
Failure to schedule the required inspections and receive approval of work
authorized by the permit before covering said work or at completion shall
result in revocation of the permit and void any associated approvals granted by
the City. This failure shall also equate to working without a permit in
violation of the City Code and no future permits shall be issued to any person
or company who has outstanding violations of this code or any other laws or
ordinances of the City. Failure to contact the City for any inspection or
follow-up prior to expiration of a permit shall be deemed a violation of this
code section. Failure to contact the City for any inspection or follow-up prior
to expiration of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall also be deemed a
violation of this code section. Allowing occupancy of a structure, for which a
person or company holds a building permit, prior to or without a valid

ICC.
      Published data is utilized by the Administrative Official in an effort to
maintain consistency and fairness for permit fee calculations. It is not
intended to reflect actual taxable value.
      The method for determining the value of the additional listed residential
items will be as follows:
      The square foot of the listed structure, times the dwelling – Type V –

accessory thereto, in the City shall be in conformity with the provisions of
this Zoning Code. Any existing building or structure and any existing use of
properties not in conformity with the regulations herein prescribed shall be
regarded as nonconforming properties or uses.
165.03 INTERPRETATION.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, they shall
be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health,

nevertheless, be utilized for single family detached dwelling purposes provided
the measurements of such area, width or open space are established by the
Zoning Code.
165.06 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The F-1 Flood Plain District herein established is intended to provide a
reasonable approach to flood control based on present information. As
additional information becomes available, the extent of various boundaries
shall be so altered to maintain this reasonableness. The Zoning Code does not
imply that areas beyond the district limits will be free from flooding; nor
shall the Zoning Code, or districts established herein, create a liability on

actions of the applicant.
      G.   That granting the application will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures, or

for that area.
   4.   Notification and Public Hearing for Variance Requests.
      A.   Application for any adjustment permissible under the provisions of
this Section shall be made to the Zoning Administrator, in the form of a

      B.   Upon receipt of any applications, such officer shall set a time and
place for public hearing before the Zoning Board of Adjustment for such

its order deciding the matter and serve a copy of such order upon the applicant
or the petitioner by mail.
   5.   Duties of Zoning Administrator, Board of Adjustment, City Council and
Courts on Matters of Appeal.
      A.   It is the intent of the Zoning Code that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning
Administrator and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of
Adjustment only on appeal from the decision of the Zoning Administrator and
that recourse from the decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be to the
City Council, then the Courts as established by Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa. (See Section
165.08(2)(H)(2) of this Code of Ordinances)
      B.   The duties of the City Council in regard to the Zoning Code shall
include hearing and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that
may arise in such case where the decision of the Board of Adjustment is

provided by law and establishing a schedule of fees and charges as stated in
Section
165.13.
165.09 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   Any person who shall violate any of the provisions hereof or who shall fail

statement in any document required to be submitted under the provisions hereof,
is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be punished by
a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) or by imprisonment for a
period not to exceed thirty (30) days or both, and in addition shall pay all
court costs. Each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate

situated into another district, by amendment to the Zoning Code.
   2.   Change any of the regulations of the Zoning Code as to the use of land
in any district, or as to the restrictions upon buildings or structures herein,
by amendment to the Zoning Code.

Administrator in duplicate, accompanied by a fee as determined by the City
Council. The Zoning Administrator shall forward one (1) copy to the Commission.
   2.   The Commission shall take action on such application within thirty (30)
days and transmit its recommendations to the City Council. The Commission may

certified to the Council.
   3.   The Commission shall give notice of the time and place of the public
hearing. Notice shall be given not more than thirty (30) days or less than

least once in a newspaper of general circulation and by notifying by mail, at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting, the property owners within three
hundred (300) feet of the subject property. The current County Assessor’s tax
record shall be deemed sufficient for the location or certification of
ownership of said properties.
   4.   All amendments concerning Floodway and Flood Fringe portions of the
Flood Plain District must be submitted and approved by the Department of
Natural Resources prior to adoption.
   5.   The City Council, upon receiving reports of the Commission, and without
further public hearing, may vote on the adoption of any proposed amendment or
it may refer it back to the Commission for further consideration. If no
recommendation is transmitted by the Commission within thirty (30) days after
the hearing, the City Council may take action without awaiting such
notifications. In considering such recommendations, due allowances shall be
made for existing conditions, for the conservation of property values, for the
direction of building development to the best advantage of the entire City and
for the uses to which the property affected is being devoted at the time; and
no change shall be recommended unless it is required for the public good. The
Council may over-rule the recommendations of the Commission by three-fourths
(3/4) vote of the full membership of the Council.
165.12 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS AND PROCEDURES.

unless the Commission shall find:
      A.   That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already
permitted, or substantially diminish and impair property values within the
immediate vicinity.
      B.   That the establishment of a conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding vacant property
values within the immediate vicinity.

control offensive odor, fumes, dust, noise and vibration, so that none of these
will constitute a nuisance and to control lighted signs and other lights in
such a manner that no disturbance to neighboring properties will result.
   4.   Fees. To defray administrative costs for processing requests for
Conditional Use Permits, a fee shall be paid by the applicant. Such fee shall
be established by the City Council.

commence, or complete, or both, such action within the time limit set shall
void the Conditional Use Permit.
   6.   Violations. Violations of such Conditions and Safeguards, when made
part of the terms under which the Conditional Use Permit is granted, shall be

such permit shall be issued to make such change unless it is in compliance with
the provisions of the Zoning Code.
      C.   No vacant flood plain land shall be occupied or used and no building
hereafter erected, altered or moved shall be occupied until the applicant

before the damage occurred.
      The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of an “historic
structure,” provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as an “historic structure.”

167.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Creston are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Department of Natural Resources.
   1.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect
and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Creston and its
residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and
comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in Section
167.02(2)(A) of this ordinance with provisions designed to:

167.10 APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Adjustment. A Board of Adjustment is
hereby established which shall hear and decide (i) appeals and (ii) requests
for variances to the provisions of this ordinance, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board.
   2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this ordinance, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
   3.   Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this ordinance that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards:
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local Codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   4.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
      A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal
or a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this ordinance and may
prescribe such conditions as contained in Section
167.10(4)(B)(2).
         (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall
Be Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinance and:
            a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
            b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
            c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.
            d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.
            f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.

and floodplain management program for the area.
            j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
            l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
            m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
ordinance.

occupancy may be stored temporarily by the owner at his or her place of
residence if such vehicle is operable and in good repair.
168.11 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND OR STRUCTURES.
   1.   Interpretation. This Zoning Code and the districts herein, or any later
amendments may create situations where structures, buildings, or uses of the
land previously permitted may become prohibited, regulated or otherwise
restricted. It is the intent of the Zoning Code to permit the continuance of
these nonconforming structures or uses until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by the Zoning Code to be
incompatible with the permitted uses in the districts involved.
      A.   An existing building or premises devoted to a use not permitted by
the Zoning Code in the district in which such building or premises is located
shall not be enlarged upon, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered,
not be used as grounds for adding other buildings or structures prohibited
elsewhere in the same district, except when required to do so by law or
ordinance, unless such use is changed to one permitted in the district in which
such building or structure or land is located.
      B.   A nonconforming use of a building may be replaced with another
nonconforming use provided no structural alterations are made.
      C.   No change from one nonconforming use to another shall be made
without first applying to and receiving from the Commission a permit to make
such change except as defined in Subsection 168.11(2), Nonconforming Lots of
Record.
      D.   A nonconforming use may be changed to conforming use at any time.
      E.   Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use,
such shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
      F.   The extension or addition of a lawful use to any portion of a
nonconforming building or structure or land shall not be deemed as the
extension of the nonconforming use.
      G.   Where nonconforming status applies to a building or structure, the
removal or destruction of same shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the
land.
      H.   If a building or structure is moved for any reason or any distance
whatever, it shall therefor conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is removed.
      I.   All uses which lawfully exist on the effective date of the Zoning
Code and are classified as a Conditional Use by the Zoning Code for the
district in which they are located, shall be considered lawful Conditional
Uses.
      J.   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one district to another district of a different
classification, the provisions of this Section shall also apply to any
nonconforming uses developing as a result of such action.
   2.   Nonconforming Lots of Record.
      A.   A single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of the Zoning Code, may
be erected in any district in which single family dwellings are permitted on
any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of or amendment to
the Zoning Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even
though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that
are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
      B.   Variance of area, width, and yard requirements shall be obtained
only through action of the Board of Adjustment.
   3.   Construction Approved Prior to Zoning Ordinance. To avoid undue
hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall require change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any building or structure provided that:
      A.   A building permit has been issued within sixty (60) days prior to
the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance.
      B.   The construction of the building or structure shall have commended
within thirty (30) days after the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance.
      C.   The construction is continuous until the building or structure is
completed.
      D.   Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent position; except where demolition or
removal of an existing building or structure has commended preparatory to
construction, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until
completion of the building or structure involved.
   4.   Repairs and Maintenance.
      A.   Nothing in the Zoning Code shall prevent the reconstruction,
repairing or rebuilding of a nonconforming building, structure or part thereof
existing at the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, rendered necessary by
wear and tear, deterioration or depreciation provided the cost of such work
shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement value of such building
or structure at the time such work is done, or prevent compliance with the
provisions of the City Building Code or City Housing Codes relative to the
maintenance of buildings or structures; provided that the cubic content of the
building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning Code
shall not be increased. That the above apply to all dwellings except for the
cubic content requirement and that all structure additions shall comply with
yard and area regulations for their respective district.
      B.   Nothing in the Zoning Code shall prevent the reconstruction,
repairing, rebuilding and continued use of any nonconforming building or
structure damaged by flood, fire, collapse, explosion, or Acts of God,
subsequent to the date of the Zoning Ordinance, wherein the expense of such
work does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost of the building
or structure at the time such damage occurred. However, the Board of Adjustment
may issue a Conditional Use Permit for reconstruction if the use is located
outside the floodway and, upon reconstruction, is adequately floodproofed,
elevated, or otherwise protected in conformity with the Flood Plain District.
   5.   Discontinuance.
      A.   When a nonconforming use of structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18
months during any three year period, the structure, or structure and premises
in combination, shall not therefore be used except in conformance with the
regulations of the District in which it is located.
      B.   A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued:
         (1)   When the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent,
or
         (2)   When the characteristic equipment and the furnishing of the
nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been
replaced by similar equipment within ninety (90) days, unless other facts
indicate the intention to resume the nonconforming use, or
         (3)   When it has been replaced by a conforming use, or
         (4)   When uses or adjuncts thereof which are or become nuisances
shall not be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses, or
         (5)   When nonconforming uses located in the floodway portion of the
Flood Plain District shall be eliminated or brought into conformity with the
standards contained in the Zoning Code within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the Board of Adjustment, after hearing for each such
nonconforming use. The Board shall make its determination upon the basis of the
normal useful life of any improvement upon the premises. In addition, the
monetary value of any competitive advantage derived by the operation of such
nonconforming use, by reason of the limitation on establishment of competing
businesses as a result of the Zoning Code, shall be considered as a reduction
of losses resulting from the requirement of termination of the use under the
Zoning Code.
   6.   Cessation of Junk and Salvage Yards. Junk or salvage yards not within
an enclosed masonry building and not within an Industrial District shall not be
operated or maintained for more than twelve (12) months after a zoning change
to a use district within which such yard is not permitted except where the
Board of Adjustment determines that it is impractical to roof over a large area
containing junk or salvage material. The Board may permit the construction
around such area of a fence, screen planting or other device of such height as
to completely screen the operation, and may then permit the continued use of
such property for such purposes for a specified period.
   7.   Nonconforming Signs. Signs which are nonconforming uses shall be
allowed to remain until removed voluntarily or for any other reason. Signs
which are intended to replace nonconforming signs or any new signs shall
conform to the provisions of the Zoning Code.

   4.   Locations Of Small Cell Facilities, Related Ground Equipment, And
Wireless Support Structures.
      A.   Collocation Preference. It is the City’s strong preference that
whenever an applicant proposes to place a new wireless support structure with a
small cell facility within 250 feet from an existing wireless support
structure, that the applicant either collocate with the existing facility or
demonstrate that a collocation is either not technically feasible or space on
the existing facility is not potentially available.
      B.   Order of Preference for Locations. The following list indicates the
order of preference for new small cell facilities from most preferred to least
preferred:
         (1)   Industrial areas if not adjacent to a municipal park,
residential area, or architectural review district.
         (2)   Highway right-of-way areas if not adjacent to a municipal park,
residential area, or architectural review district.
         (3)   Retail and commercial areas if not adjacent to a municipal park,
residential area, or architectural review district.
         (4)   Residential areas (including mixed-use areas incorporating
residential uses).
         (5)   Municipal parks.
         (6)   Architectural review districts.
      C.   Order of Preference for Wireless Support Structures. The following
list indicates the order of preference for wireless support structures for
small cell facilities:
         (1)   Existing Utility Poles. It is the City’s preference that small
cell facilities be installed on existing utility poles (electric or telephone)
or lashed onto existing telephone lines between existing utility poles.
         (2)   Non-Ornamental Municipal Service Poles. If the applicant does
not have the right to use existing utility poles or lines under reasonable
terms and conditions or the utilization imposes technical limits, the City
prefers that the applicant next looks to existing non-ornamental municipal
streetlights or traffic signal structures.
         (3)   New Poles. If the first two options in Subparagraphs (1) and (2)
of this subsection have proven to be unavailable, the City prefers the
installation of a new pole to serve as a wireless support structure.
         (4)   Ornamental Municipal Service Poles. The use of ornamental
municipal streetlights and traffic signals as wireless support structures is
strongly discouraged. These should only be proposed if the options in
Subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection are unavailable, no other
options exist for providing service to a location, or when requested by the
City based on the proposed location. When collocating on ornamental traffic
signal mast arms, the preferred collocation spot is on the traffic signal pole
without attached street signs, with the antenna placed at the top of the
vertical pole immediately below the finial. The small cell facility must not
interfere with the attachment of flags, hanging planters, banners, or similar
enhancements. Each proposed collocation will be subject to a site-specific
review.
         (5)   Sign Poles (15 feet or taller). The only sign poles that may be
considered are those that are at least 15 feet tall. These are the least
preferred option for a wireless support structure.
      D.   New Wireless Support Structures. If existing utility poles are not
available for collocation, operators may propose a new wireless support
structure. New wireless support structures that will be more than 20 feet in
height shall match the design of the City’s existing signal mast arms. New
wireless support structures that will be 20 feet or less in height shall match
the City’s existing streetlights. These requirements are to ensure new wireless
support structures conform to existing structures within the area. Information
on the manufacturer and model identification and detailed drawings of these
support structures can be provided by the City.
   Residential Areas. In residential areas, new wireless support structures
should be located to avoid obstructing the view of building facades by placing
the wireless support structure at a corner, intersection, or along a lot line.
New wireless support structures should be located in the yard location where
other overhead utilities are located unless it is not technically feasible to
do so. Applicants shall clearly explain the rationale for requests that deviate
from this expectation.
   In order to meet the service needs of operators, the City will consider
requests to locate small cell facilities on other City property, such as
municipal parking lots, at reasonable lease rates, fees, and terms.
   5.   Alternative Locations. The City reserves the right to propose an
alternative wireless support structure to the one proposed in the application.
The City may also propose an alternate location for a new wireless support
structure within 100 feet of the proposed location or within a distance that is
equivalent to the width of the right-of-way in or on which the new wireless
support structure is proposed, whichever is greater, which the operator shall
use if it has the right to use the alternate location on reasonable terms and
conditions and the alternate location does not impose technical limits or
additional costs.
   6.   Guidelines on Placement.
      A.   General Guidelines. Generally, an applicant shall construct and
maintain small cell facilities and wireless support structures in a manner that
does not:
         (1)   Obstruct, impede, or hinder the usual travel or public safety on
a right-of-way.
         (2)   Obstruct the legal use of a right-of-way by other utility
providers.
         (3)   Violate nondiscriminatory applicable codes.
         (4)   Violate or conflict with this Code of Ordinances or these
guidelines.
         (5)   Violate the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.
      B.   Materials. The City desires to promote cleanly organized and
streamlined facilities using the smallest and least intrusive means available
to provide wireless services to the community. Generally, a small cell facility
or wireless support structure shall match and be consistent with the materials
and finish of the adjacent municipal poles of the surrounding area adjacent to
their location. In the absence of adjacent municipal poles, the wireless
support structure shall match the materials and finish of the adjacent utility
poles.
      C.   Antennas on Existing or Replaced Utility Poles or Municipal Poles.
The antenna(s) associated with collocation on existing or replaced, utility
poles or municipal poles must have concealed cable connections, antenna mount,
and other hardware. The maximum dimensions for antennas shall not be more than
six cubic feet in volume, including any enclosure for the antenna.
      D.   Minimization of Impact. Small cell facilities and wireless support
structures and related equipment shall be placed, as much as possible, in line
with other utility features and in a location that minimizes any obstruction,
impediment, or hindrance to the usual travel or public safety on a right-of-
way.
      E.   Height Above Ground.
         (1)   Small Cell Facilities. Small cell facilities shall be installed
at least 10 feet above the ground. If a small cell facility attachment is
projecting toward the street, for the safety and protection of the public and
vehicular traffic the City may require the attachment to be installed no less
than 25 feet above the ground.
         (2)   New Wireless Support Structures. In areas where there are no
wireless support structures or utility poles taller than 30 feet in height
above ground level and the maximum allowable height for building construction
in the underlying zoning district is 30 feet in height above ground level or
less, the overall height of a new wireless support structure and any collocated
antennas shall not be more than 30 feet in height above ground level.
         (3)   All Other Areas. In all other areas, the overall height of a new
wireless support structure and any collocated antennas shall not be more than
40 feet in height above ground level.
         (4)   Existing Wireless Support Structures. For an existing wireless
support structure, the antenna and any associated shroud or concealment
material are permitted to be collocated at the top of the existing wireless
support structure and shall not increase the height of the existing wireless
support structure by more than five feet.
      F.   Protrusion. No protrusions from the outer circumference of the
existing or new structure or pole shall be more than two feet. The pole and all
attachments to the pole that are projecting, or any equipment or appurtenance
mounted on the ground, shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
and shall not obstruct an existing or planned sidewalk or walkway. The City, at
its option, may waive the requirement to limit the protrusion to no more than
two feet.
      G.   Location of Equipment – General.
         (1)   Removal. Small cell facilities and related equipment shall not
impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic in the right-of-way. If any small cell
facility or wireless support structure is installed in a location that is not
in accordance with the plans approved by the City, impedes pedestrian or
vehicular traffic or does not comply or otherwise renders the right-of-way non-
compliant with applicable laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act,
then the operator shall promptly remove the small cell facilities or wireless
support structure. Similarly, any abandoned small cell facilities shall be
promptly removed, barring a showing that the facility serves as an auxiliary,
backup, or emergency equipment or is otherwise not abandoned. In any case,
removal of facilities, as required herein, shall take place within 90 days
following receipt of notice from the City to the operator to remove the same.
Facilities not removed by the operator within 90 days of written notice from
the City will be removed by the City without further notice and the City will
bill the operator for all costs associated with such removal, including but
limited to reasonable attorney fees, and court costs to the extent necessary.
         (2)   Noise. The applicant is required to incorporate ambient noise
suppression measures and to place equipment in locations less likely to impact
adjacent residences or businesses to ensure compliance with all applicable
noise regulations and so as not to create a nuisance.
         (3)   Utility Lines. Service lines must be undergrounded whenever
feasible to avoid additional overhead lines. For metal poles, undergrounded
cables and wires must transition directly into the pole base without any
external junction box.
         (4)   Spools and Coils. To reduce clutter and deter vandalism, excess
fiber optic or coaxial cables for small cell facilities shall not be spooled,
coiled, or otherwise stored on the pole except within the approved enclosure
such as a cage or cabinet.
         (5)   Above-Ground Conduit. On wood poles, all above-ground wires,
cables, and connections shall be encased in the smallest section or smallest
diameter PVC channel, conduit, u-guard, or shroud feasible, with a maximum
dimension of four inches in diameter. Such conduit shall be finished in zinc,
aluminum, or stainless steel, or colored to match those metal finishes.
      H.   Location of Ground Mounted Equipment. Ground equipment should be
minimal and the least intrusive. It should be placed to minimize any
obstruction, impediment, or hindrance to the usual travel or public safety on a
right-of-way, maximize the line of sight required to add to safe travel of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic and maximize that line of sight at street
corners and intersections and minimize hazards at those locations. The City may
deny a request that negatively impacts vehicular or pedestrian safety.
      The equipment shroud or cabinet must contain all the equipment associated
with the facility other than the antenna. All cables and conduits associated
with the equipment must be concealed from view, routed directly through the
metal pole (with the exception of wood power poles) and undergrounded between
the pole and the ground-mounted cabinet.
      I.   Location of Pole Mounted Equipment. All pole-mounted equipment must
be installed as flush to the pole as possible. Equipment attached to metal
poles must be installed using stainless steel banding straps. When the straps
are attached to a metal pole, they must match the color of the pole. Through-
bolting or use of lag bolts is prohibited. All pole mounted equipment shall be
located as close together as technically possible and if possible, on the same
side of the pole.
      When pole-mounted equipment is either permitted or required, all
equipment other than the antenna(s), electric meter, and disconnect switch must
be concealed within an equipment cage. Equipment cabinet may not extend more
than 24 inches from the face of the pole. The equipment cabinet must be non-
reflective, colored to match the existing pole if attached to a metal pole, and
in the color of brushed aluminum if attached to a wood pole. Equipment cabinets
should be mounted as flush to the pole as possible. Any standoff mount for the
equipment cabinet may not exceed four inches.
         (1)   Electric Meter. The City strongly encourages site operators to
use flat-rate electric service when it would eliminate the need for a meter.
When a meter is necessary, site operators shall use the smallest and least
intrusive electric meter available. Whenever permitted by the electric service
provider, the electric meter base should be painted to match the pole.
         (2)   Telephone/Fiber Optic Utilities. Cabinets for telephone or fiber
optic utilities may not extend more than 24 inches from the face of the pole,
and must be painted, wrapped, or otherwise colored to match the pole. Microwave
or other wireless backhaul is discouraged when it would involve a separate and
unconcealed antenna.
      J.   Underground Equipment Vaults. Equipment in an environmentally
controlled underground vault may be required in some areas where
technologically feasible and appropriate for the location.
      K.   New Wireless Support Structures.
         (1)   Spacing. The City strongly discourages more than one new
wireless support structure per block and will not approve more than one per 250
feet on each side of the street to minimize the hazard of poles adjacent to
roadways and minimize visual clutter and distractions to vehicular traffic. An
exemption may be granted if the applicant can demonstrate that this restriction
has the effect of preventing wireless service to this location. Wireless
support structures shall be spaced apart from utility poles or wireless support
structures supporting small cell facilities at the same spacing between utility
poles in the immediate proximity.
         If multiple requests are received to install two or more poles that
would violate the spacing requirement or to collocate two or more small cell
facilities on the same wireless support structure, priority will be given to
the first request received that meets these guidelines.
         (2)   Alignment With Other Poles. The centerline of any new wireless
support structure must be aligned, as much as possible, with the centerlines of
existing poles on the same street segment, but only if the new structure’s
height does not conflict with overhead power utility lines and facilities, and
the pole may be offset sufficiently to avoid such conflict.
         (3)   General Restrictions on New Wood Poles. In all locations, the
City reserves the right to require a metal pole rather than a wood pole based
on the built or natural environment character of the proposed site location.
The City will not approve any new wood poles in an Architectural Review
District.
         (4)   Wood Pole Footings and Foundations. All new wood poles must be
direct buried to a depth determined, stamped, sealed, and signed by a
professional engineer licensed and registered by the State of Iowa, and subject
to the City’s review and approval.
         (5)   Metal Pole Footings and Foundations. All new metal poles must be
supported with a reinforced concrete pier. The design including the pier,
footings, and anchor bolts shall be stamped, sealed, and signed by a
professional engineer licensed and registered by the State of Iowa, and subject
to the City’s review and approval. All anchor bolts must be concealed from
public view with an appropriate pole boot or cover subject to the City’s prior
approval.
         (6)   Metal Pole Material. All new metal poles must be constructed
from hot-dip galvanized steel or other corrosion-resistant materials approved
by the City and finished in accordance with these guidelines to avoid rust
stains on adjacent sidewalks, buildings, or other improvements.
         (7)   Metal Pole Finish. All new metal poles must match the finish of
the adjacent poles. The applicant may select a paint or powder coat system in
compliance with ASTM standards.
         (8)   Lightings, Planters, Flags, Banners. The City may require the
applicant to install functional streetlights or brackets to hold hanging flower
planters, flags, or banners when technically feasible and the City determines
that such additions will enhance the overall appearance and usefulness of the
proposed facility. The City may install hanging flower planters, flags,
banners, or similar enhancement features utilizing the brackets.
      L.   City-Owned Wireless Support Structures.
         (1)   Required Loan Analysis. Installation on all City-owned poles,
including traffic signals and streetlights, shall have an industry standard
pole load analysis completed, sealed, and signed by a professional engineer
licensed and registered by the State of Iowa and submitted to the City with
each permit application indicating that the City-owned pole to which the small
cell facility will be attached will safely support the load.
         (2)   Height of Attachments. All attachments on all City-owned poles
shall be at least 10 feet above grade, and if a small cell facility is
projecting toward the street the City may require the attachment to be
installed no less than 25 feet above the ground for the safety and protection
of the public and vehicular traffic.
         (3)   Power Source. A small cell facility on a City-owned wireless
support structure may use the same power source that provides power for the
original purpose of the wireless support structure. The City will provide a
proposed flat rate for anticipated annual cost of power.
         (4)   Installations on Traffic Signals and Street Lights. Installation
on all traffic signal structures or streetlights must not interfere with the
integrity of the facility in any way that may compromise the safety of the
public. The installation must not interfere with other existing uses on the
pole such as traffic signals, streetlights, hanging flower planters, flags,
banners, or similar enhancements. Installation of small cell facilities on any
traffic signal structure or streetlight shall:
            a.   Be encased in a separate conduit than the traffic light
electronics.
            b.   Have a separate electric power connection than the traffic
signal or streetlight structure.
            c.   Have a separate access point than the traffic signal or
streetlight structure.
         (5)   Installations on Sign Poles (15 feet or taller). Installation on
sign poles may only occur if the sign pole is 15 feet or taller.
         (6)   Reservation of Space for Future Public Safety or Transportation
Uses. An application for space on a City owned or operated wireless support
structure that conflicts with space reserved for future public safety or
transportation uses documented in an approved plan in place at the time of the
application will be denied unless the operator pays for the replacement of the
pole or wireless support structure and the replaced pole or wireless support
structure will accommodate the future use and the small cell facility.
   7.   Undergrounding Requirements. The City may deny requests to install
structures and facilities in the right-of-way or on City property in an area
where the City has required all structures and facilities except those owned by
the City to be placed underground or elsewhere in the right-of-way or a utility
easement. These areas are easily identifiable as those locations where electric
has been placed underground; however, if an applicant is uncertain as to
whether such facilities have been placed underground in the area, the applicant
should contact the City for clarification before applying for or installing any
wireless support structures or small cell facilities in the area. The applicant
may request a waiver if the operator is unable to achieve its service objective
using a location in the right-of-way or on City property where the prohibition
does not apply, in a utility easement the operator has the right to access, or
in or on other suitable locations or structures made available by the City at
reasonable rates, fees, and terms.
   8.   Aesthetic Requirements.
      A.   Concealment.
         (1)   New Wireless Support Structures. It is the City’s preference
that all new wireless support structures be camouflaged, except for those
located in an area that is predominantly industrial. The applicant shall submit
its proposal for camouflage with the permit application.
         (2)   Small Cell Facilities. Small cell facilities shall be concealed
or enclosed as much as possible in an equipment box, cabinet, or other unit
that may include ventilation openings. Unless approved by the City, in writing,
there shall be no external cables and wires hanging off a pole. The approved
ones shall be sheathed or enclosed in a conduit, so that wires are protected
and not visible or visually minimized to the extent possible.
         (3)   Equipment Enclosures. Equipment enclosures, including electric
meters, shall be as small as possible. Ground-mounted equipment shall
incorporate concealment elements into the proposed design, concealment may
include, but shall not be limited to, landscaping, strategic placement in less
obtrusive locations, and placement within existing or replacement street
furniture.
         (4)   Landscaping. Landscape screening shall be provided and
maintained around ground mounted equipment enclosures. The planting quantity
and size should be such that 100 percent screening is achieved within two years
of installation. The City may grant an exemption from this landscaping
requirement based on the characteristics of the specific location for the
equipment enclosure. Tree “topping,” or the improper pruning of trees is
prohibited. Any proposed pruning or removal of trees, shrubs, or other
landscaping already existing in the right-of-way, or proposed root pruning or
other impacts to underground vegetation, must be noted in the application and
must be approved by the City. Removal shall be strongly discouraged and shall
only be allowed when there are no other feasible alternatives.
         (5)   Underground Vaults. When underground vaults are proposed, they
shall be located to minimize disruption to the placement of street trees.
Adequate planting depth shall be provided between the top of the vault and the
finished grade to allow plants to grow in a healthy condition.
      B.   Colors. All colors shall match the background of any wireless
support structure that the facilities are located upon. In the case of existing
wood poles, finishes of conduit shall be zinc, aluminum, or stainless steel, or
colored to match those metal finishes, and equipment cabinets shall be the
color of brushed aluminum. Ground mounted equipment cabinets shall be the color
of brushed aluminum.
      C.   Signage, Lights, Logos, Decals, and Cooling Fans.
         (1)   Signage. The operator shall post its name, location identifying
information, and emergency telephone number in an area on the cabinet of the
small cell facility that is visible to the public. Signage required under this
section shall not exceed four-inches by six-inches, unless otherwise required
by law (e.g., RF ground notification signs) or the City. If no cabinet exists,
the signage shall be placed at the base of the pole.
         (2)   Lights. New small cell facilities and wireless support
structures shall not be illuminated, except in accordance with State or federal
regulations, or unless illumination is integral to the camouflaging strategy
such as design intended to look like a streetlight pole.
         (3)   Logos and Decals. New small cell facilities and wireless support
structures shall not include advertisements and may only display information
required by a federal, State, or local agency. Utilize the smallest and lowest
visibility radiofrequency (RF) warning sticker required by government or
electric utility regulations. Place the RF sticker as close to the antenna as
possible and remove or paint over unnecessary equipment manufacturer details.
         (4)   Cooling Fans. In residential areas, use a passive cooling
system. In the event a fan is needed, use a cooling fan with a low noise
profile.
   9.   General Provisions.
      A.   Tree Maintenance. The operator, its contractors, and agents shall
obtain written permission from the City before trimming trees in the right-of-
way hanging over its small cell facility or wireless support structure to
prevent branches of such trees from contacting an attached small cell facility.
When trimming such trees on private property is desired, then before commencing
any such work the operator, its contractors, and agents shall notify the
property owner and the City and obtain the owner’s permission. When directed by
the City, the operator shall trim under the supervision and direction of the
City. The City shall not be liable for any damages, injuries, or claims arising
from the operator’s actions under this section.
      B.   Minor Technical Exceptions. The City recognizes that in some
circumstances strict compliance with these guidelines may result in undesirable
aesthetic outcomes and that minor deviations should be granted when the need
for such deviation arises from circumstances outside the applicant’s control.
      C.   Waivers if Requirements Have the Effect of Prohibiting the Provision
of Wireless Service To a Location. In the event any applicant asserts that
strict compliance with any provision in these guidelines, as applied to a
specific proposed small cell facility, would effectively prohibit the provision
of personal wireless services, the City may grant limited waivers from strict
compliance.
      D.   Application and Recurring Fees. Application fees for permits to site
small cell facilities shall conform to the requirements of Section 8C.7A of the
Code of Iowa and recurring annual fees per small wireless facility shall be
fixed at the presumptively reasonable rate of $270.00 per year as provided in
the FCC Declaratory Ruling and Order 18-133 at Paragraph 19. The City, however,
reserves the right to conduct cost studies and to adjust such fees, from time
to time, to the extent permitted by applicable State and federal laws and
regulations.

   1.   “Airport” means the Creston Municipal Airport.
   2.   “Airport elevation” means the highest point of an airport’s usable
landing area measured in feet above mean sea level.
   3.   “Airport hazard” means any structure or object of natural growth
located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use of land near a
public airport that – obstruct the airspace required for the flight of aircraft
landing or taking off at the airport; or is otherwise hazardous to aircraft
landing or taking off at the airport.
   4.   “Airport overlay zones” is a zone intended to place additional land use
conditions on land impacted by the airport while retaining the existing
underlying zone. The FAR Part 77 Surfaces and RPZs have been combined to create
five airport overlay zones. The five specific zones create a comprehensive area
focused on maintaining compatible land use around airports.
      A.   Zone A (Runway Protection Zone) – is intended to provide a clear
area that is free of above ground obstructions and structures. This zone is
closest to the individual runway ends.
      B.   Zone B (Approach Surface) – is a critical overlay surface that
reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway at an airport. The
size of Zone B is predicated upon the type of approach (visual, non-precision,
or precision) that a specific runway has and the type/size of aircraft
utilizing the runway.
      C.   Zone C (Transitional Surface) – includes those areas that are
parallel to the runway pavement and extend from the edge of the primary
surface.
      D.   Zone D (Horizontal Surface) – is typically elliptical in shape,
depending upon the runway types and configurations at an individual airport.
      E.   one E (Conical Surface) – is the outermost zone of the overlay areas
and has the least number of land use restriction considerations. Zone E begins
at the edge of the horizontal surface and is 4,000 feet in width paralleling
the horizontal surface.

   16.   “Creston municipal airport” is defined as any areas of land or water
that is used, or intended for use, for the landing, takeoff, and storage of
aircraft. Any appurtenant areas that are used, or intended for use, for airport
buildings, other airport facilities, or right-of-way; and all airport buildings
and facilities located on the areas specified in this definition.
   17.   “Easement” is the legal right of one party to use a portion of the
total rights in real estate owned by another party. This may include the right
of passage over, on, or below property; certain air rights above the property,
including view rights; and the rights to any specified form of development or
activity, as well as any other legal rights in the property that may be
specified in the easement document.
   18.   “Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)” is a federal agency charged

wholesale market, for transfer to other plants, or to order for firms or
customers. Goods are generally not displayed or sold on site, but if so, they
are a subordinate part of sales (typically 10% or less of the total gross floor
area). Relatively few customers come to the site.
      B.   Industrial, manufacturing, wholesale trade, and warehouse/storage
uses including uses that produce goods from raw or finished materials, uses
that distribute goods in large quantities to primarily wholesale customers, or
provide for storage or warehousing of goods, either in enclosed buildings or

comply with the regulations and standards from which a variance is sought.
   59.   “Visual approach” means an approach to an airport conducted with
visual reference to the terrain.
   60.   “Visual runway” means a runway without an existing or planned
straight-in instrument approach procedure.
   61.   “Visual Flight Rules (VFR)” means rules that govern the procedures for
conducting flight under visual conditions. The term “VFR” is also used in the
United States to indicate weather conditions that are equal to or greater than
minimum VFR requirements. In addition, “VFR” is used by pilots and controllers
to indicate the type of flight plan.
   62.   “Wetland” means land on which water covers the soil is present either
at or near the surface of the soil or within the root zone, all year or for
varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season.

expansion of a nonconforming use.
169.03 AIR SPACE OBSTRUCTION ZONES & AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONING MAP.  
   The zones established by this ordinance are illustrated on the official
Creston Municipal Airport Zoning Map. Such Official Airport Zoning Map may be
amended from time to time, and all notations, references, elevations, data,
zone boundaries, and other information thereon, is hereby adopted as part of
this ordinance.
169.04 AIRPORT ZONING REQUIREMENTS.  
   In accordance with Section 329.10, Iowa Code, there are three (3) principal
airport zoning requirements supported by additional information contained
within the following remaining sections of this ordinance. These basic zoning
requirements state:
   1.   All airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter shall be
reasonable and none shall impose any requirement or restriction which is not
necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter.
   2.   a. Airport zoning adopted under this chapter may require, at the
municipality’s expense, the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of
any structure or tree, or a change in use, not conforming to the height
regulations when adopted or amended.
   b. Airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter may require a
property owner to permit the municipality at its own expense to install,
operate,
and maintain on the property markers and lights as necessary to indicate to
operators of aircraft the presence of the airport hazard.
   3.   All such regulations may provide that a preexisting legal nonconforming
structure, tree, natural growth, or use, shall not be replaced, rebuilt,
altered, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, so as to constitute a greater
airport hazard than it was when the airport zoning regulations or amendments to
the regulations were adopted.
169.05 AIRPORT ZONES.  
   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Creston Municipal Airport. Such zones are
shown on the Creston Municipal Airport Zoning Map, which is on file at City
Hall. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered
to be only in the zone with the more restrictive limitations. The various zones
are hereby established and defined as follows:
   1.   Zone A – Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) – Zone A is intended to provide a
clear area that is free of aboveground obstructions and structures. This zone
is closest to the individual runway ends. The dimensional standards for this
zone are shown in the following table:
Table 1. Zone A – Dimensional Requirements
 
Runway Ends   Approach Visibility Minimums Dimensions
Length L feet Inner Width W1 feet          Outer Width W2 feet RPZ Acres
Runway 16     1 Mile                       1,700               500 1,010 29.465
Runway 34     1 Mile                       1,700               500 1,010 29.465
Runway 04     Visual                       1,000               250 450   8.035
Runway 22     Visual                       1,000               250 450   8.035
Source: FAA AC 150/5300-13, current edition, Airport Design Standards
   2.   Zone B – Approach Surface – Zone B is a critical airport overlay zoning
surface that reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway at an
airport. The size of Zone B is predicated upon the type of approach (visual,
non-precision, or precision) that a specific runway has the type/size of
aircraft utilizing the runway.
The table on the following page illustrates the various sizes of Zone B based
upon the specific runway criteria. A portion of Zone B is overlain by Zone A
because the approach surface and RPZ overlap the entire length of the RPZ.
   Consequently, the length of Zone B begins at the inner edge of the RPZ.
   Table 2. Airport Overlay Zones B through E Dimensional Standards

   3.   Zone C – Transitional Surface – Zone C includes those areas that are
parallel to the runway pavement and extend 1,050' from the edge of the primary
surface paralleling the runway and extended runway centerline until they reach
the end of Zone A at a 90 degree angle. The specific dimensions for Zone C are
based upon various options for the primary surface that is predicated upon the
type of approach and critical aircraft.
   4.   Zone D – Horizontal Surface – Zone D is typically elliptical in shape,
depending upon the runway types and configurations at individual airports.
   5.   Zone E – Conical Surface – Zone E is the outermost zone of the airport
overlay zoning areas and has the least number of land use restriction
considerations. The zone begins at the edge of the horizontal surface and is

169.07 AIRPORT ZONING ORDINANCE ADMINISTRATION.  
   As stated in Section 329.13, Iowa Code , all airport zoning regulations
adopted under this ordinance shall provide for the administration and
enforcement of such regulations by an administrative agency of which shall be
the Airport Zoning Administrator. However, in no case, shall such
administrative agency be or include any member of the Airport Board of
Adjustment. The duties of any administrative agency designated pursuant to the
Iowa Code of this ordinance shall not include any of the powers herein
delegated to the Airport Board of Adjustment.
   It shall be the duty of the Airport Zoning Administrator referred to herein
as the “Zoning Administrator”, to administer and enforce the regulations
prescribed herein. The Zoning Administrator will be the first point of contact
on the Creston Airport Zoning Ordinance regulations, in terms of enforcing
zoning regulations.
   Applications for permits and variances from the Airport Zoning Ordinance
shall be made to the Zoning Administrator upon forms furnished by the Zoning
Administrator. Applications for the action by the Airport Board of Adjustment
shall be forthwith transmitted by the Zoning Administrator should an applicant
request review. Permit applications shall be promptly considered and either
granted or denied by the Airport Zoning Administrator according to the
regulations prescribed herein.
169.08 AIRPORT ZONING PERMITS.  
   Buildings or other structures located within the Creston Municipal Airport
land use and height overlay zoning area as defined within this ordinance shall
not be erected, moved, added to, or structurally altered without an airport
zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator. Airport zoning permits may be
reviewed and granted in conjunction with or supplemental to a City of Creston
zoning permit or regulations. City of Creston zoning permits and regulations
only apply to property within the corporate limits of the City of Creston.
   It shall be the duty of the applicant to provide the Airport Zoning
Administrator with sufficient information to evaluate the proposed action. This
information shall include but not be limited to the following as noted in the
Compatible Land Use Planning Checklist & Permit Application :
   1.   Contact information including applicant and engineer/architect
information.
   2.   Structure information and/or type of construction.
   3.   Site information (a site plan consistent with the city’s zoning
regulations).
   4.   Drawing information.
   5.   Identify current and potential compatibility concerns.
   6.   Develop compatible criteria.
   7.   Additional considerations/land use concerns.
   The Zoning Administrator shall evaluate the proposal based upon information
provided by the applicant. The Zoning Administrator shall approve the permit if
after evaluation, the proposed project is found to be adequately compatible.
Should the proposed project be found to be incompatible after review, the
Zoning Administrator shall deny the permit. Should the permit be denied, the
applicant shall have the right to request an appeal as prescribed in this
ordinance. Any airport zoning permit shall be null and void if the purpose for
which the permit is issued has not commenced within one (1) year from the date
of issuance. Should the activity not be commenced within that time, a new
zoning permit shall be required.
169.09 HAZARDOUS MARKINGS AND LIGHTING.  
   This section provides for safe aircraft operations, as well as the health,
safety, and welfare of individuals on the ground within the vicinity of the
airport by identifying lighting and marking requirements. Lighting and marking
requirements will be determined through an FAA 7460-1 airspace analysis. The
owner of any structure, object, natural vegetation, or terrain is hereby
required to install, operate, and maintain such markers, lights, and other aids
to navigation necessary to indicate to the aircraft operators in the vicinity
of an airport the presence of an airport hazard. Hazardous markers and lights
shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the
municipality.
169.10 AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.  
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be grown, altered, or maintained, and
no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a
height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such
zones. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of
the zones in question as follows:
   1.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. Slopes twenty (20) feet outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
   2.   Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes thirty-
four (34) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
   3.   Transitional Zones. Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 1,450.00 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) foot outward
for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending where they intersect the conical surface. Where
the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90
degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
   4.   Horizontal Zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or
at a height of 1,450.00 feet above mean sea level.
   5.   Conical Zone. Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the
airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport
elevation.
   6.   Increase in Elevation of Structures. No structure shall be erected that
raises the published minimum descent altitude or decision height for an
instrument approach to any runway, nor shall any structure be erected that
cause the minimum obstruction clearance altitude or minimum en route altitude
to be increased on any Federal airway in the County.
169.11 AIRPORT BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   There is hereby created an Airport Board of Adjustment to have and
exercise the following powers: (1) to hear and decide appeals from any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the
enforcement of this chapter; (2) to hear and decide special exemptions to the
terms of this chapter upon which such Airport Board of Adjustment under such
regulations may be required to pass; and (3) to hear and decide specific
variances.
   2.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall consist of five (5) members, two
(2) appointed by the City of Creston, two (2) appointed by Union County, and
one (1) additional member to be selected by the members of the Airport Board of
Adjustment. The terms of the members of the Airport Board of Adjustment shall
be five (5) years, excepting that when the board shall first be created, one of
the members appointed by each municipality shall be for a term of two (2) years
and one for a term of (4) four. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired
term of any member whose office becomes vacant in which the member was
selected. Members shall be removable by the appointing authority for cause,
upon written charges after a public hearing.
   3.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules for its governance
and in harmony with the provisions of this chapter. Meetings of the Board shall
be held at the call of the chairperson and at such other times as the Airport
Board of Adjustment may determine. The Chairperson, or in the absence of the
Chairperson, the acting Chairperson may administer oaths and compel the
attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be
public. The Airport Board of Adjustment shall keep minutes of its proceedings,
showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to
vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations, and
other official actions, all of which shall immediately be filed in the office
of the Clerk and on due cause shown.
   4.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall make written findings of facts
and conclusions of law giving facts upon which it acted and its legal
conclusions from such facts upon which it acted and its legal conclusions from
such facts in reversing, affirming or modifying any order, requirement,
decision or determination which comes before it under the provisions of this
chapter.
   5.   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Airport Board
of Adjustment shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirement, decision,
or determination of the Zoning Administrator or to decide in favor of the
applicant, on any matter upon which is required to pass under this chapter, or
to effect variation to this chapter.
169.12 VARIANCES.
   In accordance with Section 329.11, Iowa Code , any person desiring to erect,
alter, or increase the height of any structure, object, or to permit the growth
of any natural vegetation, or otherwise use the person’s property in violation
of airport zoning regulations adopted under this ordinance, may apply to the
Airport Board of Adjustment for a variance from such zoning regulations. The
application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
airspace as determined applicable by the Zoning Administrator. Such variances
shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations
would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief
granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but would do substantial
justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this
chapter; provided, however, that any such variance may be allowed subject to
any reasonable conditions that the Airport Board of Adjustment may deem
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Ordinance.
   No application for variance to the height requirements of this Ordinance may
be considered by the Airport Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the
application has been submitted to the Iowa Department of Transportation
Aeronautics Division for advice as the aeronautical efforts for the variance.
If the Iowa Department of Transportation Aeronautics Division does not respond
to the application within twenty-five (25) working days, excluding weekends and
holidays after receipt, the Airport Board of Adjustment may act on its own to
grant or deny said application. Any application for variance other than for
height restrictions, must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for an
opinion as to the aeronautical effects of the variance before the application
may be considered by the Airport Board of Adjustment.
169.13 APPEALS.
   1.   Any person aggrieved or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the
Zoning Administrator made in the administration of this chapter may appeal to
the Airport Board of Adjustment.
   2.   All appeals hereunder must be taken within a reasonable time as
provided by the rules of the Airport Board of Adjustment by filing with the
Zoning Administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Airport Board of
Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
   3.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Airport Board of
Adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason
of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would be the opinion of the
Zoning Administrator cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed except by the order of the Airport Board of
Adjustment on notice to the Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown.
   4.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and
decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   5.   The Airport Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as may be appropriate under the
circumstances.

Height and Land Use Zoning Ordinance shall be subject to the same fines and
penalties as a zoning violation, as stated in 165.09 of the Creston Code of
Ordinances. The violation of any of the provisions of this ordinance shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Each day a violation continues to exist shall
constitute a separate offense.
169.16 AIRPORT ZONING COMMISSION.

shall not be constructed to require the removal, lowering or other changes or
alternation of any structure, tree, or use of land legally not conforming to
the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance codified by this
chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of legal nonconforming
uses. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction,

use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was
on the effective date of the ordinance codified by this chapter or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   3.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Airport Board
of Adjustment Chairperson determines that a legal nonconforming tree,
structure, or use of land has been abandoned or regarding physical structures
is damaged, torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed by more than 70
percent of the assessed value, no permit shall be granted that would allow such
structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate
from the zoning regulations. With that being said, if a building or use is
destroyed or deteriorated by more than 70 percent of the assessed value as
defined in this chapter and falls within a use category that is labeled as
Additional Review (AR), said building and/or use may be rebuilt and/or
permitted so long as it meets the review criteria used in the Additional Review
land use category.

   In accordance with Section 329.8, Iowa Code , where there exists a conflict
between any of the regulation or limitations prescribed in this ordinance and
any other regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with
respect to height or structures, the use of land, or any other matter, the more
stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.
169.20 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person
or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other
provisions or applications of the ordinance, which can be given effect without
the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this
ordinance are declared to be severable.

Engineer, one to the Clerk and the fourth copy to the owner or subdivider for
filing with the County Recorder. If the plat is disapproved by the Council such
disapproval shall point out wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
170.13 MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT.
   1.   Standards Prescribed. The standards set forth in this chapter shall be
considered the minimum standards necessary to protect the public health, safety
and general welfare.
   2.   Land Suitability. No land shall be subdivided which is found to be
unsuitable for subdividing by reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage,
adverse soil conditions, adverse geological formations, unsatisfactory
topography or other conditions likely to be harmful to the public health,
safety or general welfare, unless such unsuitable conditions are corrected to
the satisfaction of the City. If land is found to be unsuitable for subdivision
for any of the reasons cited in this section the Council shall state its
reasons in writing and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present data
regarding such unsuitability. Thereafter, the Council may reaffirm, modify or
withdraw its determination regarding such unsuitability.
   3.   Lands Subject to Flooding. No subdivision containing land located in a
floodway or a flood hazard area shall be approved by the City without the
approval of the State Department of Natural Recourses. No lot shall be located
so as to include land located within a floodway or flood hazard area unless the
lot is of such size and shape that it will contain a buildable area not within
the floodway or flood hazard area, suitable for development as allowed by the
Zoning Code for the zone in which the lot is located. Land located within a
flood hazard area or a floodway may be included within a plat as follows,
subject to the approval of the City:
      A.   Included within individual lots in the subdivision, subject to the
limitations of this section.
      B.   Reserved as open space for recreation use by all owners of lots in
the subdivision, with an appropriate legal instrument, approved by the City,
providing for its care and maintenance by such owners.
      C.   If acceptable to the City, dedicated to the City as public open
space for recreation or flood control purposes.
   4.   Plat to Conform to Comprehensive Plan. The arrangement, character,
extent, width, grade and location of all streets and the general nature and
extent of the lots and uses proposed shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan of
the City; and shall conform to such other plans, including but not limited to a
Major Street Plan, a Sanitary Sewer Plan or a Parks and Open Spaces Plan.
   5.   Construction Standards for Improvements. In addition to the standards
set forth in this chapter, the City Engineer shall from time to time prepare,
and the Council shall from time to time adopt by resolution, technical
standards for public improvements. Such technical standards for public
improvements shall contain the minimum acceptable specifications for the
construction of public improvements and may vary for classes of improvements,
giving due regard to the classification of streets or other improvements, and
the extent and character of the area served by the improvements. Upon adoption
by the Council by resolution, such technical standards for public improvements
shall have such force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein.
   6.   Acreage Subdivisions. Where the parcel of land is subdivided into
larger tracts than ordinarily used for building lots, such parcel shall be
divided so as to allow for the opening of major streets and the ultimate
extension of adjacent minor streets. Easements providing for the future opening
and extension of such streets may, at the discretion of the Council, be made a
requirement of the plat.
   7.   Relation to Adjoining Street System. New subdivisions shall make
provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
additions (or for their proper projection where adjoining property is not
subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for public requirements. In
general, such streets shall be of a width as great as that of the streets so
continued or projected but shall not be less than the minimum width
requirements.
   8.   Street Arrangements. The street system shall be so arranged to comply
as far as practicable with the major street plan of the City. Streets shall
intersect as nearly as possible to a right angle and in no case shall they
intersect at less than 60 degrees. No street shall be parallel or approximately
parallel to a railroad, unless it is 150 feet or more from the line of the
railroad right-of-way. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125
feet shall be avoided.
   9.   Street Right-of-ways.
      A.   The widths for all street rights-of-way shall conform with the
following table, which refers to street types as designated on the Major Street
Plan:
 
RIGHT-OF-WAY STREET TYPES IN FEET
State Arterials           Requirements set by Iowa DOT
Regional Arterials        80 feet
Community Arterials       70 feet
Collector Streets         60 feet
Minor Streets             60 feet
 
      B.   The minimum width for streets shall be 60 feet between property
lines, except that in cases where the topography or special conditions make a
street of less width more suitable, the Commission and Council may waive the
above requirements.
      C.   Half streets are prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations; and where the Commission finds it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted with such tract.
   10.   Street Grades. Street grades, if practical, shall not exceed six
percent for all minor streets.
   11.   Alleys. The minimum width of an alley in a residential block shall be
20 feet (alleys are not recommended for residential districts except under
unusual conditions). Alleys will be required in the rear of all business lots
and shall be at least 24 feet wide. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where
possible, but if unavoidable shall be provided with adequate turnaround
facilities at the dead end.
   12.   Easements Where There Are No Alleys. Where alleys are not provided,
easements of not less than five feet shall be provided on each side of all rear
lots and side lines where necessary for poles, wires, conduits, storm and
sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains. Easements of greater width may be
required along lines or across lots where necessary for the extension of main
sewers and similar utilities. The subdivider shall consult with the City
Engineer and the managers of local utility companies regarding need and
location of easements.
   13.   Places. Where it is desired to subdivide a parcel of land, which
because of its size or location does not permit a normal lot or street area,
there may be established a “place.” Such a place may be in the form of a court,
non-connecting street or other arrangement, provided, however, that proper
access shall be given to all lots from a dedicated place (street or court). If
any dead-end place is more than 250 feet in length, it shall terminate in an
open space, preferably circular, having a minimum diameter of 100 feet. Except
in unusual instances, no dead-end street or place shall exceed 600 feet in
length.
   14.   Blocks. All blocks shall be required to have a maximum length of 500
feet.
   15.   Lot Lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation to this rule
will give a better street and lot plan. Double frontage and reverse frontage
lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least 10 feet shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic
artery or other disadvantageous use and no right of access shall be provided
across said easement.
   16.   Size and Shape of Lots. Minimum lot size shall be governed by the City
Zoning Regulations. Lots shall be conveniently shaped and the depth of lots
shall generally not exceed their width by more than 2½ times provided the width
is at least 60 feet at the building line. Each lot shall have at least 20 feet
of frontage on a street.
   17.   Corner Lots. Corner lots on major street intersections and at all
other points likely to be dangerous shall have a radius of not less than 15
feet at the street corner. On business lots, a chord may be substituted for the
circular arc. Corner lots shall not be less than 70 feet in width.
   18.   Street Names. Streets that are obviously in alignment with others
already existing and named shall bear the name of existing streets; otherwise,
names shall not duplicate existing street names and names similar to existing
street names shall not be permitted.
   19.   Building Lines. Building lines shall be shown on the plat or included
in the owner’s statement on all lots whenever the depth of such building lines
is greater than those required by the Zoning Code. Provisions shall be made in
the owner’s statement requiring all enclosed parts of buildings to be set back
to such building lines.
   20.   Character of Development. The Commission and the Council may require
that certain minimum regulations regarding type and character of development be
incorporated in the owner’s statement of plat. Such regulations shall be
intended to protect the character and development of the platted subdivision,
as well as that of the surrounding development.
   21.   Easements Along Streams and Water Courses. Whenever any stream or
surface water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall, at his or her own expense, make adequate provisions for the
proper drainage of surface water and shall also provide and dedicate to the
City an easement along said streams and water courses meeting the approval of
the Council.
170.14 IMPROVEMENTS.
   Before the final plat of any subdivision area shall be approved and
recorded, the subdivider shall make and install the improvements required in
this section. In lieu of final completion of the required improvements, before
the final plat is finally approved, the subdivider shall enter into contract
with the City to insure the completion of the improvement within a specific
time not to exceed 180 days. The performance of said contract shall be secured
by the filing of a bond (or cash) to be approved by the Council. Said bond or
cash shall not be less than the approximate cost of the improvements as
estimated by the City Engineer.
   1.   Street Grading and Surfacing. All streets within any subdivision shall
be brought to grade established from the City datum plane. All street surfaces
shall conform in width with the following table which refers to street types as
designated on the Major Street Plan.
MINIMUM WIDTHS OF STREETS
STREET TYPE STANDARDS
MINIMUM WIDTHS OF STREETS
STREET TYPE         STANDARDS
