waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the

the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

reasonable belief that the structure was used as specified crime property and
that the provisions of this chapter shall apply; or (ii) there is not
sufficient reasonable belief that the structure was being used as specified

provisions of this chapter.

46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
   A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
   B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
   C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
   D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
   F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

younger shall be in any public place during the following times:

through 17 years of age shall be in any public place during the following

Sunday through Thursday – 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.

either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible for
the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
   C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the

knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
   D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.

custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority may
employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private entity,

exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity

addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05   FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay $3.00 if claimed within five days
of impounding, plus $1.00 for each additional day within the reclaiming period
plus towing charges, if stored by the City, or towing and storage fees, if
stored in a public garage, whereupon said vehicle shall be released. The amount

title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08   PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the expense
of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification required, in
accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner of the motor
vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be deposited in the
State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails to realize the
amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply for
reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.

illegal connection by the end of the second one-year period, the City will seek
to enforce this policy using all lawful means, including (but not limited to)
the prosecution of a municipal infraction which could result in a civil
penalty, court cost, and/or a court order requiring the repairs be made within
a certain time period.
      (4)   Inspection by City staff both prior to and after repairs shall be
necessary for certification of compliance with the City I and I Policy and for
reimbursement. In addition, a billing statement for services performed shall
accompany the request for reimbursement.

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

hereinafter called “Company,” and to its successors and assigns the right and
franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain and operate in the City a gas
distribution system, to furnish natural gas along, under and upon the streets,
avenues, alleys and public places to serve customers within and without the
City and to furnish and sell natural gas to the City and its inhabitants. For
the term of the franchise, the Company is granted the right of eminent domain,
the exercise of which is subject to City Council approval upon application by
the Company. The franchise shall be effective for a 25-year period from and
after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.† 4
 
Notes
4 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 2098, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on April 1, 2013.
110.02   RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa.
110.03   EXCAVATONS.
Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the purpose
of laying, relaying, repairing or extending gas pipes, mains, conduits, and
other facilities provided that the same shall be so placed as not to
unreasonably interfere with the construction of any water pipes, drain or sewer
or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may hereafter be located by
authority of the City.
110.04   LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in accordance
with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on file with and made effective by the
Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended (“Tariff’), at its cost and
expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or equipment in, on, over
or under any public street or alley in the City in such a manner as the City
may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating the construction,
reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the street or alley. If the City has
a reasonable alternative route for the street, alley, or public improvements or
an alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the
Company installations, the City shall select said alternative route or
construction method. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,
copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross section drawings. If tree
removals must be completed by the City as part of the City’s project and are
necessary whether or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City at its
own cost shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree
removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
Company must remove trees that are included in the City’s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove the trees at its cost or reimburse the
Company for the expenses incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a
source other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
110.05   RESTORATION AFTER EXCAVATION.
In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys, and public places for
the installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the surface,
restoring it to the condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current City
code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent
to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediately previous
existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously existing
condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to comply
with City, State or federal rules, regulations or laws.
110.06   VACATING STREETS; UTILITY EASEMENT.
Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide Company with not
less than 60 days’ advance notice of the City’s proposed action and, upon
request, grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,
alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost and expense obtain easements
for existing Company facilities.
110.07   RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right-of-way which have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City at any time during the previous 10 years.
Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by this
chapter, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in order to directly or indirectly facilitate the
project of a commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, City
shall reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-public entity to
reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to
relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order to
facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.08   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend,
indemnify, and save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent
arising from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
110.09   PROJECT INFORMATION.
Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“Information”). The
Company and City recognize the Information may in whole or part be considered a
confidential record under State or federal law or both. Therefore, the City
shall not release any Information without prior consent of the Company and
shall return the Information to Company upon request. City recognizes that
Company claims the Information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by State or federal law on other grounds and
agrees to retain the Information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps or information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time.
110.10   EXTENSIONS OF MAINS.
The Company shall extend its mains and pipes and operate, and maintain the
system in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities
Board or its successors and Iowa law.
110.11   STANDARDS OF SERVICE.
During the term of the franchise, the Company shall furnish natural gas in the
quantity and quality consistent and in accordance with the applicable
regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board the Company’s tariff made effective by
the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors and Iowa law.
110.12   POLICE REGULATIONS.
All reasonable and proper police regulations shall be adopted and enforced by
the City for the protection of the facilities of the Company.
110.13   FRANCHISE FEE.
A franchise fee is imposed upon, and shall be collected from, the natural gas
customers of the Company receiving service pursuant to the Tariff and located
within the corporate limits of the City. The franchise fee shall be imposed
upon the gross receipts, minus uncollectible accounts, derived from the sale of
natural gas and distribution service pursuant to the Tariff. City imposes the
franchise fee upon the following revenue classes:
Residential Customers   3 percent
Nonresidential Customers   3 percent
Transportation Customers   3 percent
1.   The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt customer classes of sales
from imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease or eliminate the
franchise fee. The City reserves the right to cancel any or all the franchise
fee exemptions and also reserves the right to grant exemptions to customer
classes in compliance with Iowa law and this section. The City does therefore
exempt the customer classes listed above from paying franchise fees.
2.   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following 90 days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the franchise fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes
subject to or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide
the information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the
Company. The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a
list of premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of
the City.
3.   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes
subject to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall
be solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to—or to the extent permitted by law—exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
4.   The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in
any 24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers,
increasing, decreasing, modifying, or eliminating the franchise fee shall
become effective, and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an
agreed upon date which is not less than 60 days following written notice to the
Company by certified mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such
new ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the Council.
5.   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising out
of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In
addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from
any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified,
by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a
different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.
6.   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
quarter as follows.
January, February and March
April, May and June
July, August and September, and
October, November and December
MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of any
changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
7.   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
8.   The Company shall not, under any circumstances, be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and
remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers, the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
9.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this section is
modified or repealed if:
   A.   Any other person is authorized to sell natural gas at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this section, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate.
   B.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural gas at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of natural gas within the City.
   C.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final non-appealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this section can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
10.   The other provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below, with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   A.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
   B.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   C.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
11.   Upon implementation of a franchise fee the City shall not, pursuant to
Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or charge Company right-of-way
management fees for permits for Company construction, maintenance, repairs,
excavation, pavement cutting or inspections of Company work sites and projects
or related matters.
110.14   TERMINATION.
Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate the franchise if the other party
shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for
cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching
party may terminate the franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in
breach of the franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal
law. A party shall not be considered to have breached the franchise if the
alleged breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other
party.

pipes, drain or sewer, or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may
hereafter be located by authority of the City.
111.04   TRIMMING TREES.
The Company is authorized and empowered to prune or remove at Company expense

installation, maintenance or repair of conductor, conduits or the erection of
poles and wires or other appliances, the Company shall not unreasonably
obstruct the use of the streets, and shall replace the surface, restoring the
condition as existed prior to the Company excavation. The Company shall not be
required to restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks or other areas in
or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate
previously existing condition or to a condition required for the City to comply
with City, State or federal rules, regulations or law. Company agrees any
replacement of road surface shall conform to current City code regarding its
depth and composition.
111.07   VACATING STREETS; UTILITY EASTMENT.
Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has electric facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide Company
with not less than 60 days’ advance notice of the City’s proposed action and,
upon request grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,
alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost and expense obtain easements
for existing Company facilities.
111.08   RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right-of-way that have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City in the previous 10 years. Pursuant to
relocation of Company facilities as may be required by this section, if the
City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing facilities or
equipment in order to facilitate the project of a commercial or private
developer or other non-public entity, the City shall reimburse or the City
shall require the developer or non-public entity to reimburse the Company for
the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocation of its existing
facilities or equipment. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order
to facilitate such private project at its expense.
111.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the electric facilities authorized by this franchise; provided,
however, the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify and save
harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from the
negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
111.10   PROJECT INFORMATION.
Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in city right-of-way. The Company and City
recognize the information provided will, under current Iowa law, constitute
public records, but that nonetheless, some information provided will be
confidential under State or federal law or both. Therefore, the City shall not
release any information with respect to the location or type of equipment which
the Company owns or controls in the right of way which may constitute a trade
secret or which may otherwise be protected from public disclosure by state or
federal law. Furthermore, the City agrees that no documents, maps or
information provided to the City by the Company shall be made available to the
public or other entities if such documents or information are exempt from
disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission Critical Energy Infrastructure requirements
pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as
such statutes and regulations may be amended from time to time.
111.11   STANDARDS OF OPERATION.
The Company shall construct, operate and maintain its facilities in accordance
with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors
and Iowa law. During the term of the franchise, the Company shall furnish
electric energy in the quantity and quality consistent with and in accordance
with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board, the Company’s
tariff and made effective by the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors and
Iowa law.
111.12   FRANCHISE FEE.
There is hereby imposed upon and shall be collected from the retail electric
customers of the Company receiving service, pursuant to the Tariff, located
within the corporate limits of the City and remitted by the Company to the
City, a franchise fee from each customer class as set forth below of the gross
receipts, minus uncollectable amounts, derived by the Company from the delivery
and sale of electric energy to customers within the corporate limits of the
City:
Residential Customers   3 percent
Nonresidential Customers   3 percent
Transportation Customers   3 percent
1.   The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt customer classes of sales
from imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease or eliminate the
franchise fee. The City reserves the right to cancel any or all the franchise
fee exemptions and also reserves the right to grant exemptions to customer
classes in compliance with Iowa law and this section. The City does therefore
exempt the customer classes or customer groups shown below franchise fees.
2.   The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in
any 24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers,
increasing, decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee shall become
effective, and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon
date which is not less than 60 days following written notice to the Company by
certified mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such new
ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the City Council.
3.   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following 90 days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the franchise fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes
subject to or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide
the information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the
Company. The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a
list of premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of
the City.
4.   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes
subject to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall
be solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
5.   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising out
of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In
addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from
any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified,
by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a
different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.
6.   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
quarter as follows.
January, February and March
April, May and June
July, August and September, and
October, November and December
MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of any
changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
7.   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
8.   The Company shall not, under any circumstances, be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and
remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
9.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this section is
modified or repealed if:
   A.   Any other person is authorized to sell electricity at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this section, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate.
   B.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural electricity at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in
which case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in
the additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of electricity within the City.
   C.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final non-appealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this section can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
10.   The other provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below, with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   A.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
   B.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
11.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company the
right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
12.   The City shall not, pursuant to Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa,
impose or charge Company right-of-way management fees for permits for Company
construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation, pavement cutting or inspections
of Company work sites and projects or related matters.
111.13   TERMINATION.
Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate the franchise if the other party
shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for
cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching
party may terminate the franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in
breach of the franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal
law. A party shall not be considered to have breached the franchise if the
alleged breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other
party.

non-compensatory. For purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of
this section, and to provide for a reasonable and nondiscriminatory policy
governing extensions of cable service within the City, Grantee shall extend
service to new subscribers at the normal installation charge and monthly rate

a subscriber terminal in such buildings owned or used by the City, and in such
buildings owned or used by recognized educational authorities within the City,
both public and private, as may be designated by the governing body having

having jurisdiction thereof. This provision is meant to apply only to those
buildings accessible to Grantee’s system.

thereof, because of: (i) dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; (ii) faulty
construction; (iii) the removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the
ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; (iv) the
deterioration, decay or inadequacy of its foundation; or (v) any other cause,
is likely to partially or completely collapse.
5.   Manifestly Unsafe. Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or
any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being
used.
6.   Exterior Walls. Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural

to be used for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate
light, air or sanitation facilities, or otherwise, is determined by any health
officer to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such condition that
it is likely to cause sickness or disease.
10.   Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction, faulty electric wiring, gas connections
or heating apparatus, or other cause, is determined by the Fire Marshal or Fire
Chief to be a fire hazard.
11.   Public Nuisance. Whenever any building or structure is in such a
condition as to constitute a public nuisance known to the common law or in
equity jurisprudence.
12.   Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.

to protect public and private investments, ensure the health, safety and
welfare of the population, to provide for the regulation and administration of
the orderly location of antenna arrays and towers and to secure the rights of

in all zoning districts. The height of the antenna shall not exceed the height
of the existing structure by more than 20 feet. If the antenna is to be mounted
on an existing structure, a site plan shall not be required but the following
conditions must be met where applicable:
1.   Water Tower Sites. The City’s water towers represent a large public
investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves.
Therefore, its protection is of prime importance. As access to the City’s water
storage system increases, so does the potential for contamination of the public
water supply. For these reasons, the placement of communications towers or
antennas on water towers will be allowed only when the following requirements
are met:
   A.   The applicant must have approval from the Public Works Director each
time access to the facility is desired. This will minimize the risk of
contamination to the water supply.
   B.   It is determined by the Public Works Director that there is sufficient
room on the structure and/or the grounds to accommodate the applicant’s
facility.
   C.   It is determined that the presence of the facility will not increase
the water tower maintenance cost to the City.
   D.   It is determined that the presence of the facility will not be harmful
to the health or safety of the workers maintaining the water tower.
   E.   A lease fee of $500.00 per month will be charged for the placement of
antenna/tower on a City water tower.
2.   All Other Existing Structures Other than Water Tower Sites. Any
communications facilities located on the roof of an antenna support structure
must be set back at least one foot from the edge of the roof of the structure.
This setback requirement shall not apply to: (i) communications facilities
located above the roof of the structure if the facilities are appropriately
screened from view through the use of panels, walls, fences or other screening
techniques approved by the City; or (ii) camouflaged antennas that are mounted
to the exterior of the antenna support structures below the roof, but do not
protrude more than 24 inches from the side of such an antenna support
structure.
158.10   SPECIAL USE PERMIT IS REQUIRED.
A cell site with antenna that is either not mounted on an existing structure or
is more than 20 feet higher than the structure on which it is to be mounted
shall not be permitted except pursuant to a special use permit issued by the
Board of Adjustment.
158.11   STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
The following standards and procedures shall apply to the issuance of a special
use permit for a cell site with antenna:
1.   Necessity. The wireless communications company shall demonstrate, using
technological evidence, that the antenna must be located where it is proposed
in order to satisfy the antenna’s function in the company’s grid system.
2.   Co-Location Effort. If the wireless communications company proposes to
build a tower as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing structure, it
shall demonstrate that it has contacted the owners of structures with adequate
height within a one-quarter mile radius of the site proposed, asked for
permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was denied for
reason other than failure to agree on compensation. The Board of Adjustment may
deny a request for a special use permit if it concludes that the applicant has
not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing structure.

height, guy wires and anchors, existing structures, photographs or elevation
drawings depicting typical design of proposed structure.
   B.   Parking Spaces. If a cell site is fully automated, adequate parking
shall be required for maintenance personnel. If a cell site is not automated,
the number of parking spaces shall be equal to the number of personnel on the
largest work shift.
   C.   Fencing. An opaque fence shall be installed around the antenna support
structure and other equipment unless the antenna is mounted on an existing
structure. The fence shall be a maximum of six feet in height and serve to
screen the base of the structure and to ensure safety.
   D.   Setbacks From Base of Antenna Support Structure. The minimum distance
between the base of the support structure and guy anchors and any property line
shall be the largest of the following:
      (1)   Fifty percent of the antenna height.
      (2)   The minimum setback in the underlying zoning code.
      (3)   Sixty (60) feet.
9.   Air Safety. Support structures 200 feet in height or taller shall meet all
Federal Aviation Administration regulations.
158.12   CELL SITES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
Prior to a special use permit being issued by the Board of Adjustment for the
location of antenna or towers on private property, the applicant must show that
available publicly owned sites and available privately owned sites occupied by
compatible use, are unsuitable for operation of the facility.
158.13   NOISE AND EMISSION STANDARDS.
1.   Noise. No equipment shall be operated at towers and telecommunications
facilities so as to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under
WAC 173-60, except during emergencies or periodic routine maintenance which
requires the use of a back-up generator, where the noise standards may be
exceeded temporarily.
2.   Emissions. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the FCC sole
jurisdiction to regulate radio frequency emissions. Facilities that meet the
FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of emissions
impacts. Applicants for tower sites shall be required to provide information on
the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC
standards.
158.14   ABANDONMENT.
In the event the use of any communications tower has been discontinued for a
period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the City
Administrator who shall have the right to request documentation and/or
affidavits from the communications tower owner/operator regarding the issue of
tower usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator shall have an additional
180 days within which to: (i) reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the
tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or (ii)
dismantle and remove the tower. At the earliest, 181 days from the date of
abandonment, without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and
removal, any special exception, variance and/or special use permit for the
tower shall automatically expire.
158.15   TERMINATION.
The Council may terminate any lease if it is determined that any one of the
following conditions exist.
1.   A user’s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users of
higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately
predicted in the technical analysis.
2.   A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the City’s lease agreement.
Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the intended
termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a hearing
before the Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be
followed in emergency situations.
158.16   HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforced against the holders of any lease.
158.17   NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any lease, developments within the field for which
the grant was made to the holder of the lease present the opportunity to the
holder of the lease to be more effective, efficient and economical through the
use of a substance or material other than those for which the lease was
originally made, the holder of the lease may petition the Council which, with
such requirements or limitations as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the
terms and conditions of the lease.

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACTS AND PURPOSE.
1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its residents.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all areas having special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City.
For the purpose of this chapter, the special flood hazard areas are those areas
designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Polk County and
Incorporated Areas, City of Mitchellville, Panels 19153C0245F, 0275F, dated
February 1st, 2019 which is hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter.
2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the (Zoning Administrator) shall make the
necessary interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the City of Mitchellville in the enforcement or
administration of this Ordinance.
3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,

160.05   FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the
following applicable performance standards. Where base flood elevations have
not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether the land involved is
either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the
100 year flood level. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not
required for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or
culverts where: (i) the bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains
less than 100 square miles; and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated
with a channel modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in
567-71.2(1)b, Iowa Administrative Code.
1.   All development within the special flood hazard areas shall:
   A.   Be consistent with the needs to minimize flood damage.
   B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
   C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to
flood damage.
   D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, state and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood
warning time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood
warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2
(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
3.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the 100-year flood; and that the structure, below
the 100-year flood level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
   A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including basements)
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five feet or more, the
applicant shall be required to sign and record with the Polk County Record Non-
Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains compliant
with the criteria outlined in this paragraph.
   B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
   C.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
5.   Factory-Built Homes:
   A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated
on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a
minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level.
   B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-
the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems:
   A.   On-site wastewater disposal and water supply systems shall be located
or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
   B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
   C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a
level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood
elevation.
   D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as levees,
flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood
with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources shall
approve structural flood control works.
9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the 100-year flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50
lots (whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for those
areas located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
   A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential. Its
size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the structure
located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-resistant
materials.
   B.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
   C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site so
as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
   D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation, collapse
and lateral movement.
   E.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
   F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for such a structure
may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the
structure and its contents.
12.   Recreational Vehicles.
   A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection 5
of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days; and
      (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
   B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
13.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
14.   Maximum Damage Potential Uses. All new or substantially improved maximum
damage potential uses shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year flood, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.
When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the
State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate
to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces
and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual chance flood; and that the
structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood elevation is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation data has not
been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determinations.
160.06   ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.   The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration
of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
   C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall Be Based. In passing
upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
   A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
   B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
   C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
   D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
   E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
   F.   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
   G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
   H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
   I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for the area.
   J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
   K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
   L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
   M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
   A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
   B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
   C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
   D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
   E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.07   NONCONFORMING USES.
1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including
flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
160.08   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
160.09   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

165.04   COMPUTATIONS.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
1.   Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of sign face (which is
also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence
or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets Zoning regulations and is
clearly incidental to the display itself.
2.   Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area from a sign with
more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign
faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back
to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time,
and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more
than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one
of the faces.
3.   Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower
of: (i) existing grade prior to construction; or (ii) the newly established
grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or
excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the
normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on
the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign
is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street
or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure
on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
4.   Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Zone Lot. The
permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be
computed by applying the formula contained in Table 165.05B, Maximum Total Sign
Area, to the frontage, building frontage or wall area, as appropriate, for the
zoning district in which the lot is located. Lots fronting on two or more
streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However,
the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed
the portion of the lot’s total sign area allocation that is derived from the
lot, building or wall area frontage on that street.
165.05   SIGNS ALLOWED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH AND WITHOUT PERMITS.
Signs are allowed on private property in the City in accordance with, and only
in accordance with, Table 165.05A.
If the letter “P” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is allowed
without prior permit approval in the zoning district represented by that
column. If the letter “S” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is
allowed only with prior permit approval in the zoning district represented by
that column. Special conditions may apply in some cases. If the letter “N”
appears for a sign type in a column, such a sign is not allowed in the zoning
district represented by that column under any circumstances. Although permitted
under this section, a sign designated by an “S” or “P” in Table 165.05A shall
be allowed only if:
1.   The sum of the area of all building and freestanding signs of the zone lot
conforms with the maximum permitted sign area as determined by the formula for
the zoning district in which the lot is located as specified in Table 165.05B.
2.   The size, location and number of signs on the lot conform with the
requirements of Tables 165.05C and 165.05D, which establish permitted sign

on-premises sign oriented to the Interstate shall be allowed for each lot which
contains a retail business providing food, lodging, or fuel and repair services
essential to normal operation and maintenance of motor vehicles; is not
separated from the Interstate by any property, on either side of the route of
access, that is zoned or designated by the Comprehensive Plan for any
residential or office use; and is located within a travel distance of 2,600
feet from the Interstate Highway, said distance being calculated by beginning
at the center point of the Interstate median at the nearest interchange, and
thence measuring along the centerlines of streets traveled to reach the
property’s primary access, to the closest point on the lot. Such Interstate
Signs shall comply with all regulations of this chapter, provided that the
following bulk regulations apply in lieu of those contained in Table 165.05C.
   A.   Orientation. The faces of a free-standing or roof sign shall be
perpendicular to, or in the case of a curve, radial to the right-of-way of the
nearest section of Interstate.

subsection 2 of this section, for motor fuel price signs.
   C.   Height. The maximum height of a freestanding sign shall be 50 feet.
   D.   Setback. The minimum setback of a freestanding sign from any property
line shall be 50 feet.
2.   Motor Fuel Price Signs. Gasoline service stations, convenience, stores and
similar retail businesses selling gasoline or similar fuels for use in motor
vehicles as a major part of their business shall be allowed sign area in
addition to that customarily permitted by this chapter, to display changeable
price information for such fuel. The copy on each such price sign shall be
limited to the type of fuel and price. The maximum copy area shall not exceed
16 square feet. The signage shall be incorporated in a permitted sign type and
shall not be a separate sign structure or portable sign.
165.07   PERMITS REQUIRED.
If a sign requiring a permit under the provisions of this chapter is to be
placed, constructed, erected or modified on a zone lot, the owner of the lot
shall secure a sign permit prior to the construction, placement, erection or
modification of such a sign in accordance with the requirements of Section
165.14. Furthermore, the property owner shall maintain in force, at all times,
a sign permit for such sign in accordance with Section
165.15. No signs shall be erected in the public right-of-way except in
accordance with Section
165.10 and the permit requirements of Section
165.17. No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or proposed
sign unless such sign is consistent with the requirements of this chapter
(including those protecting existing signs) in every respect and with the
Master Signage Plan or Common Signage Plan in effect for the property.
165.08   DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
All signs shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the
following standards:
1.   All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of the Uniform Building
Code and the Electrical Code of the City at all times.

all respects with the requirements of this chapter, all signs shall be
constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the
ground, a building or another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall,
frame or structure.
3.   All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in compliance
with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this chapter,
at all times.
165.09   MASTER OR COMMON SIGNAGE PLAN.
No permit shall be issued for an individual sign requiring a permit unless and
until a Master Signage Plan or a Common Signage Plan for the zone lot on which
the sign will be erected has been submitted to the Zoning Administrator and
approved by the Zoning Administrator as conforming with this section.
1.   Master Signage Plan. For any zone lot on which the owner proposes to erect
one or more signs requiring a permit, unless such zone lot is included in a
Common Signage Plan, the owner shall submit to the Zoning Administrator a
Master Signage Plan containing the following:
   A.   An accurate plot plan of the zone lot, at such scale as the Zoning
Administrator may reasonably require.
   B.   Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways and landscaped areas on
such zone lot.
   C.   Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for
individual signs, the height of the signs and the number of freestanding signs
allowed on the zone lot(s) included in the plan under this chapter.
   D.   An accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of
each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not,
except that incidental signs need not be shown.
2.   Common Signage Plan. If the owner of a single lot with more than one
building (not including any accessory building) or the owners of two or more
contiguous (disregarding intervening streets and alleys) zone lots file with
the Zoning Administrator for such zone lots a Common Signage Plan conforming
with the provisions of this section, a 25 percent increase in the maximum total
sign area shall be allowed for each included zone lot. Bonus shall be allocated
within each zone lot as the owners elect.
3.   Provisions of Common Signage Plan. The Common Signage Plan shall contain
all of the information required for a Master Signage Plan and shall also
specify standards for consistency among all signs on the zone lots affected by
the Plan with regard to:
   A.   Color scheme.
   B.   Lettering or graphic style.
   C.   Lighting.
   D.   Location of each sign on the building.
   E.   Materials.
   F.   Sign proportions.
4.   Showing Window Signs on Common or Master Signage Plan. A Common Signage
Plan or Master Signage Plan including window signs may simply indicate the
areas of the windows to be covered by window signs and the general type of the
window signs (e.g., paper affixed to window, painted, etched on glass, or some
other material hung inside window) and need not specify the exact dimension or
nature of every window sign.
5.   Limit on Number of Freestanding Signs Under Common Signage Plan. The
Common Signage Plan, for all zone lots with multiple uses or multiple users,
shall limit the number of freestanding signs to a total of one for each street
on which the zone lots included in the plan have frontage and shall provide for
shared or common usage of such signs.
6.   Other Provisions of Master or Common Signage Plans. The Master or Common
Signage Plan may contain such other restrictions as the owners of the zone lots
may reasonably determine.
7.   Consent. The Master or Common Signage Plan shall be signed by all owners
or their authorized agents in such form as the Zoning Administrator shall
require.
8.   Procedures. A Master or Common Signage Plan shall be included in any
development plan, site plan, planned unit development plan, or other official
plan required by the City for the proposed development and shall be processed
simultaneously with such other plan.
9.   Amendment. A Master or Common Signage Plan may be amended by filing a new
Master or Common Signage Plan that conforms with all requirements of this
chapter then in effect.
10.   Existing Signs Not Conforming to Common Signage Plan. If any new or
amended Common Signage Plan is filed for a property on which existing signs are
located, it shall include a schedule for bringing into conformance, within
three years, all signs not conforming to the proposed amended plan or to the
requirements of this chapter in effect on the date of submission.
11.   Binding Effect. After approval of a Master or Common Signage Plan, no
sign shall be erected, placed, painted or maintained, except in conformance
with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision
of this chapter. In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan
and any other provision of this chapter, this chapter shall control.

application is deficient, with appropriate references to the applicable
sections of this chapter.
4.   Action. Within seven days after the submission of a complete application

application conform in every respect with the requirements of this chapter and
of the applicable Master or Common Signage Plan.

symbol described above.
165.15   SIGN PERMITS; CONTINUING.
The owner of a zone lot containing signs requiring a permit under this chapter

if not renewed or if the business license for the premises is discontinued for

lapse if such activity is not renewed.

Except as otherwise provided herein, the owner of any zone lot or other
premises on which exists a sign that does not conform with the requirements of
this chapter or for which there is no current and valid sign permit shall be
obligated to remove such sign or, in the case of a nonconforming sign, to bring
into conformity with the requirements of this chapter.
1.   Signs Existing on Effective Date. For any sign existing in the City on
September 1, 2003, an application for a sign permit must be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator before March 1, 2004. For any sign on property annexed at
a later date, applications for sign permits shall be submitted within six

be established in an annexation agreement between the City and the landowner.
Signs that are subject of applications received after the applicable date set
forth in this section shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of
this chapter and shall not be entitled to the protection of subsection 2 of
this section. Applications for permits for existing signs submitted before
March 1, 2004, shall be exempt from the initial fees adopted under authority of
this chapter, but not from renewal and subsequent fees.
2.   Nonconforming Existing Signs, Permits and Terms. A sign that would be
permitted under this chapter only with a sign permit, but which was in

to the City, and which was constructed in accordance with the ordinances and
other applicable laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which by
reason of its size, height, location, design or construction is not in
conformity with the requirements of this chapter, shall be issued a
Nonconforming Sign Permit if an application in accordance with subsection 1 of
this section is filed in a timely manner. Such permit shall allow the sign(s)
subject to such permit, which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this
chapter, to remain in place and be maintained for a period ending no later than
March 1, 2004, provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or
extent of the nonconformity. Such signs are also subject to the provisions of
subsection 3 of this section. A change in the information on the face of an
existing nonconforming sign is allowed. However, any nonconforming sign shall
either be eliminated or made to conform with the requirements of this chapter
when any proposed change, repair or maintenance would constitute an expense of
more than 25 percent of the lesser of the original value or replacement value
of the sign.
3.   Lapse of Nonconforming Sign Permit. A Nonconforming Sign Permit shall
lapse and become void under the same circumstances as those under which any
other sign permit may lapse and become void.
4.   Sign Removal Required. A sign that was constructed, painted, installed or
maintained in conformance with a permit under this chapter, but for which the
permit has lapsed or not been renewed or for which the time allowed for the
continuance of nonconforming signs has expired, shall be forthwith removed
without notice or action from the City.

due to a number of boundary changes, or to correct drafting errors or
omissions; provided, however, any such adoption shall not have the effect of
amending the original zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof. The

with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not
covered by subsections 1 through 6 above, the Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries.
166.05   APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.

herein shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set
forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of the Zoning Code

CHAPTER 167
ZONING CODE – NONCONFORMNG USES
 
167.01 Intent                          167.05 Repairs and Maintenance
167.02 Nonconforming Lots of Record    167.06 Special Exceptions
167.03 Nonconforming Use of Land       167.07 Registration of Nonconforming
                                       Uses
167.04 Nonconforming Use of Structures
 
167.01   INTENT.
Within the districts established by the Zoning Code or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures
which were lawful before the Zoning Code was adopted or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of the Zoning
Code or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. To avoid
undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require change in
the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Code and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
such work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
167.02   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of the Zoning Code, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district.
167.03   NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code,
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of
the Zoning Code as enacted or amended, such use may be continued subject to the
following provisions:
1.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of the
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
2.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of the
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
3.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period
of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by the Zoning Code for the district in which such land is
located.
167.04   NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES.
If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination,

would not be allowed in the district under the terms of the Zoning Code, the
lawful use may be continued subject to the following provisions:
1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by the Zoning Code in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
2.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any of the parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
3.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to a more restricted
classification.
4.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in

combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
167.05   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may
be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,

as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning Code shall not
be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.

168.01   VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
On a corner lot in a residential district, nothing shall be erected, placed,
planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to impede vision
between a height of two and one-half feet and 10 feet above the centerline
grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the street lines of
such corner lots and a line joining points along said street lines 25 feet from
the point of intersection of right-of-way lines.
168.02   FENCES, WALLS, AND HEDGES.
Notwithstanding other provisions of the Zoning Code, fences, walls and hedges
may be permitted in any required yard, or along the edge of any yard, provided
that:
1.   Residential District. No fence, wall, or hedge in any front yard shall
exceed 42 inches in height; and no fence, wall, or hedge shall excess 42 inches
in height along the street side yard of a corner lot. No fence or wall in any
rear yard shall exceed eight (8) feet in height.   
(Ord. 9-2020 – Apr. 22 Supp.)
2.   Commercial or Industrial. A six (6) foot tall fence may be constructed to
extend into the front yard, if setback 15 feet from the property line of the
frontage street. No fence or wall in any rear yard shall exceed ten feet in
height unless otherwise approved by the Board of Adjustment.   
(Ord. 9-2020 – Apr. 22 Supp.)
3.   Every fence hereafter erected shall be done in the following manner:
posts, supporting rails and other such supporting elements when located shall
be on and face the property on which the fence is located.
4.   No person shall place, construct or maintain, or cause to be placed,
constructed or maintained any electric fence except in A-l District.
5.   No person shall place, construct or maintain, or cause to be placed,
constructed or maintained any barbed wire or similar type material fence on
residential zoned property.
168.03   STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
No lot shall contain any building used in whole or in part for residence
purposes unless such lot abuts for at least 40 feet on at least one street, and
there shall be not more than one single-family dwelling for such frontage. The
Council may also allow, at its own discretion, the construction of a building
to be used in whole or in part for residence purposes on a lot which has an
exclusive unobstructed private easement of access at least 20 feet wide to a
street, for one single-family dwelling, if the Council determines that such
construction is not in conflict with the intent of the Zoning Code.
168.04   ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
No accessory building shall be erected in any required court or in any yard
other than a rear yard. Only one detached garage and one yard shed shall be
allowed in a rear yard. In R-l, R-2, and R-4 Districts, accessory garages shall
be no larger than 1,000 square feet and yard sheds shall not be larger than 160
square feet. Accessory buildings shall be distant at least three feet from
alley lines or easement lines, and three feet from lot lines of adjoining lots
which are in the R District, and on a corner lot they shall conform to the
setback regulations on the side street. However in no case shall any eaves or
overhang extend closer than 12 inches to a rear or side yard line, or an
easement line. Accessory buildings must be erected separately from and 10 feet
distant (into the rear yard) from the principal structure. Any building so
connected to the principal building shall be considered a part of the principal
building and must meet the space requirements thereof. Accessory buildings
shall not occupy more than 30 percent of the rear yard and shall not exceed 14
feet in height in any R District. This regulation shall not be interpreted to
prohibit the construction of a minimum 440 square foot, maximum of 1,000 square
foot detached garage on a rear yard. No accessory building shall be constructed
upon a lot until the construction of the principal building has been actually
commenced, and no accessory building shall be used unless the principal
building on the lot is also being used. Accessory buildings exceeding 160
square feet in area shall be constructed of materials that are the same or
similar to the principal building. Detached garages shall be no closer than six
feet to the principal building. If the garage is less than 10 feet it would
require fire protection per the building code. Accessory buildings may be
connected to the principal building by a breezeway with setbacks for the
principal structure. An addition may be made to an existing principal structure
which extends past the front of an existing legally established detached
accessory structure, provided no connection or attachment is made between the
existing detached structure and the addition unless setbacks can be met as
required for a principal structure. Accessory building shall be distant at
least three (3) feet from alley lines, or easement lines, and three (3) feet
from lot lines of adjoining lots in all districts.
(Section 168.04 - Ord. 9-2020 - Apr. 22 Supp.)
168.05   CORNER LOTS; SIDE YARDS.
For corner lots platted after the effective date of the Zoning Code, the street
side yard shall be equal in width to the setback regulations of the lots to the
rear having frontage on the intersecting street.
168.06   BUILDING LINES ON APPROVED PLATS.
Whenever the plat of a land subdivision approved by the Planning Commission and
on record in the office of the County Recorder shows a building line along any
frontage for the purpose of creating a front yard or side street yard line, the
building line thus shown shall apply along such frontage in place of any other
yard line required in the Zoning Code unless specific yard requirements in the
Zoning Code require a greater setback.
168.07   EXCEPTIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS.
1.   Structures Permitted above Height Limit. No permit will be issued for any
structure above height limits, except as specifically approved by the Board of
Adjustment.
2.   Double Frontage Lots. Buildings on through lots and extending through from
street to street shall provide the required front yard on both streets.
3.   Rear and Side Yards Adjacent to Alleys. In computing the depth of a rear
yard or the width of a side yard where the rear or side yard opens on an alley,
one-half of the alley width may be included as a portion of the rear or side
yard as the case may be.
4.   Other Exceptions to Yard Requirements. Every part of a required yard shall
be open to the sky unobstructed with any building or structure, except for a
permitted accessory building in a rear yard, and except for ordinary
projections not to exceed 24 inches, including roof overhang.

in question, the minimum front yard shall be the same as the building on the
other side.
7.   Zoning of Annexed Areas. Any land annexed to the City after the effective
date of the Zoning Code shall be zoned A-l Agricultural until the Zoning
Commission and Council shall have studied the area and adopted a final zoning
plan for the area. Said final zoning plan shall be adopted within six months of
the date of annexation.

onto each such arterial street except as provided below. Common drives between
adjacent landowners shall be encouraged in lieu of individual drives,
recommended to be located with the common property line as the centerline of
the drive and required to be located a minimum of 40 feet from any other drive
as measured from centerline to centerline. Where such common drive is provided
and joint access easements to parking areas are provided, required parking
spaces on each lot may be reduced in number by up to five percent.

169.02   CORE DISTRICT.
While the zoning ordinance establishes and maintains standards for development,
construction or re-construction, and growth within the City, it is also
understood that older portions of the City which had been established prior to
the zoning ordinance may not be able to conform to the requirements of the
zoning ordinance. Therefore, the City of Mitchellville has established a Core
District. The Core District will be the area north of the railroad tracks to
the south side of Sixth Street, west of the county line road and east of Cotton
Avenue and the area south of the railroad tracks to Mill Street SE between
Center Avenue and Arch Avenue. This will allow re-construction, growth, and
similar redevelopment within the area of this Core District. The Core District
is not a replacement to the zoning ordinance for the areas within the Core
District Boundary, but rather an overlay of the zoning within these areas. This
shall enable the older portions of the City to grow and redevelop within the
regulations of the zoning ordinance while maintaining the existing
characteristics of the neighborhoods within the Core District. The following
regulations shall be applied to Sections 169.03 through 169.07 of this chapter:
1.   Building Setbacks. Within the Core District, if a house or building is
currently in conformance with the building setback requirements for that
parcel, and the surrounding block is also largely in conformance with the
setback requirements of the current zoning code for that particular area, than
the property in question shall meet the building setback requirements of the
zoning code. If a house or building is not currently in conformance with the
building setback requirements for that parcel, and/or the surrounding block is
largely not in conformance with the setback requirements of the current zoning
code for that particular area, then for the purpose of building additions,
repairs, maintenance, reconstructions and new constructions, the property in
question shall meet the least restrictive building setbacks of the following:
   A.   Within the existing footprint of the existing/previous structure.
   B.   Within the average setback distances of the houses or buildings on the
block (up to 300 feet on either side of the building in question for large
blocks), and on the same side of the street as the building in question. A
random house or building that is not consistent with the other houses or
buildings on that block can be removed from consideration when determining the
buildings setbacks.
   C.   If the street right-of-way line (property line) varies within a block,
the proposed setbacks for a particular lot on that block may need to be
considered by the City Council.
2.   Lot or Parcel Areas. Within the Core District, lot or parcel areas shall
not be required to conform to the minimum allowable lot or parcel area as
established by the current zoning district for the lot or parcel in question;
but all lots or parcels shall meet the following requirements:
   A.   No lot or parcel shall be split, subdivided, or reduced in size in any
manner if the lot or parcel in question is already smaller than the allowable
lot or parcel size as established within the current zoning district.
   B.   Any lot or parcel that is larger than the minimum allowable lot or
parcel area as established within the current zoning district may be split,
subdivided or reduced in size per the City’s ordinances, as long as all
resulting lots or parcels have the minimum allowable area required by the
current zoning district, and they are all buildable lots or parcels, or
combined with a buildable lot or parcel.
169.03   R-l SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL.

169.06   R-4 MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTIAL.
The R-4 District is intended to provide for certain medium density residential
areas of the City, which by reason of their design and location, are suitable
for mobile home development and which are compatible with surrounding
residential areas. For this section only, the term “park” shall refer to the
entire mobile home park area and the term “lot” shall refer to an individual
mobile home stall rented within the park.
1.   Principal Permitted Uses. Mobile home parks, in accordance with
regulations of the State and minimum requirements contained herein, but not
including mobile home sales and display areas. No part of any park shall be
used for nonresidential purposes except such uses that are required for the
direct servicing and well-being of park residents, such as a community
building, and for the management and maintenance of the park. This shall in no
way prohibit the sale by a resident owner of a mobile home located on a mobile
home stand and connected to the pertinent utilities.
2.   Accessory Uses.
   A.   Accessory uses may include common facility service buildings which
provide laundry facilities, accessory supplies, vending machines, etc.; also
park management buildings, maintenance buildings, community buildings, and
other uses of a similar nature. All such buildings shall be located within the
central “park” area, shall be restricted to the use of the park occupants and
shall be subject to approval of the Council.
   B.   Signs in accordance with Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances.
3.   Plan Submittal. Each petition for a change to the R-4 zoning
classification shall be accompanied by a sketch plan. The sketch plan shall

mobile home space, the location of garbage receptacles, water hydrants, service
buildings, driveways, walkways, recreation areas, playgrounds, required yards,
existing and proposed grading, parking facilities, storm shelter, lighting,
landscaping, and the location of existing trees, buildings or other significant
features. Prior to development a site plan must be submitted. The site plan
will be considered by the Commission and the Council, who may approve or
disapprove the plan or require such changes thereto as deemed necessary. The
site plan shall be accompanied by a covenant to run with the land, in favor of
the City and all persons having a possessory interest in any portion of the
mobile home park, that the owner or owners of the park or their successors in
interest will maintain all interior streets, parking areas, sidewalks and
plantings in compliance with City ordinances and the site plan as approved by
the Council, which covenant shall be recorded in the office of the Polk County
Recorder, at park owner’s expense.
4.   Bulk Requirements.
   A.   Minimum Park Area. A proposed mobile home park shall have a minimum
area of five acres.
   B.   Maximum Park Density. The maximum density allowed for the gross
development area shall be seven mobile home units per gross acre.

5.   Parking. A minimum of two off-street car spaces directly accessible to the
private street for each mobile home lot shall be provided. Garage stalls shall
not count toward the minimum off-street parking requirements. These required
parking spaces, or parking areas, shall be so located as to provide convenient
access to the mobile homes but shall not exceed a distance of 200 feet from the
mobile home that it is intended to serve. All parking areas shall be
constructed with a concrete or asphalt concrete surface. Parking stalls shall
be a minimum of 9 1/2 feet in width by 20 feet in length.
6.   Streets. The entrance road connecting the park streets with a public
street shall have a minimum road pavement width of 31 feet, measured back to
back of curbs. All interior streets shall be not less than 26 feet in width,
measured back to back of curbs. All streets shall be constructed in accordance

   A.   Tie-downs or anchors shall be provided on every mobile home stand. Each
tie-down or anchor must be able to sustain a minimum tensile strength of 2,800
pounds.
   B.   Skirting of a permanent type material and construction shall be
installed within 90 days to enclose the open space between the bottom of a
mobile home floor and the grade level of the mobile home stand. This skirting
shall be maintained in an attractive manner consistent with the exterior of the
mobile home and to preserve the appearance of the mobile home park.
8.   Utilities. Sewer and water facilities shall be provided for each mobile
home lot in accordance with the requirements of the Iowa State Department of
Health. All units shall be individually metered in accordance with City
Regulations. All mobile home developments must be connected to the municipal
sanitary sewer system and the municipal water system. All electrical and
telephone lines shall be placed underground. All gas lines shall be black
steel, 120#. Each unit shall have an accessible water shut off valve as
approved by the City Water Department.
9.   Storm Shelters. Mobile homes are extremely vulnerable to tornadoes and
other high wind conditions. The greatest number of casualties in tornadoes
generally come from mobile home developments. This is primarily due to the fact
that the mobile home is usually not anchored to as firm of a foundation as a
regularly constructed building and cannot take the impact of the extremely high
winds and the accompanying flying debris. Tie-downs do not greatly increase the
stability in extremely high wind or tornado type conditions, though may be
fully adequate for lesser wind and thunderstorm conditions. Another concern in
mobile home developments is the closeness of the units which causes additional
damage. When one home is destroyed by the winds, the debris is forced into the
next subsequent unit and thereby weakening them in a domino type effect,
increasing both the loss to property and the residents. Every mobile home park
of 10 or more lots which is constructed after September 1, 2003, shall be
provided with above or below-grade storm shelters that conform to the following
requirements:
   A.   A minimum floor area of 12 square feet shall be provided for each lot
located in the mobile home park.
   B.   Shelters shall be centrally located to provide a minimum travel
distance of not more than 600 feet from any mobile home space. It may be
necessary to provide more than one shelter.
   C.   Shelters shall not be located in flood prone areas.
   D.   Shelters shall be designed and constructed to meet all applicable
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   E.   Shelters shall be designed by a licensed structural engineer or
architect and built in accordance with plans sealed by said structural engineer
or architect.
   F.   A shelter may be utilized for other purposes which are allowed as
accessory uses in this district; with the exception that the required minimum
floor area shall not be infringed, nor shall the function of the structure as a
storm shelter be limited in any way.
   G.   Shelters shall remain accessible at all hours.
   H.   For any addition of 10 or more lots to any existing mobile home park, a
storm shelter which complies with the general requirements of this section
shall be provided to serve such additional lots. For any addition of fewer than
10 lots to an existing mobile home park which otherwise complies with the
requirements of this section, there is no requirement that an additional
shelter be provided to serve such additional lots. Provided, however, when two
or more such additions occur which result in a cumulative addition of 10 or
more lots, a storm shelter shall be provided to serve such additional lots.
169.07   R-5 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
The R-5 District is intended and designed to provide a means for the
development of large tracts of ground on a unit basis, allowing greater
flexibility and diversification of land uses and building locations than the
conventional single lot method provided in other sections of this Zoning Code.
It is the intent of this section that the basic principles of good land use
planning, including an orderly and graded relationship between various types of
uses be maintained and that the sound zoning standards as set forth in this
Zoning Code and statutes concerning population density, adequate light and air,
recreation and open space, and building coverage be preserved. Planned Unit
Developments shall be permitted on any five-acre or larger tract of land that
has been zoned or rezoned for P.U.D. purposes by the City Council.
1.   Principal Permitted Uses. Buildings and permitted conditional uses shall
be used only for residential purposes; occupant garages, occupant storage space
and similar accessory uses; non-commercial recreational facilities, and
community activities, including churches and schools, with the following
exception: on a tract of land in excess of 80 acres or more, up to five percent
of the total net area may be developed for commercial uses such as those found
in the C-l classification district. The following is a description of permitted
uses:
   A.   One-family dwellings, to include manufactured homes, provided such
manufactured home is located and installed according to the same standards for
a foundation system, setback, and minimum square footage which would apply to a
site-built, single-family dwelling on the same lot. “Manufactured home” means a
structure built according to construction standards promulgated by the United
States Department of Housing and Urban Development under authority of 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 5403.
   B.   Two-family dwellings.
   C.   Multiple-family dwellings, including row housing cooperative apartment
houses and condominium units.
   D.   Churches, cathedrals, temples, and similar places of worship, provided
that all principal buildings be set back a minimum of 50 feet from all property
lines.
   E.   Publicly owned museums, libraries, parks and playgrounds, community
centers and similar uses.
   F.   Publicly owned golf courses, country clubs, tennis courts and similar
recreational uses, provided that any such use not be operated primarily for
commercial gain.
   G.   Public and parochial schools, elementary and secondary, and other
educational institutions having established current curriculum the same as
ordinarily given in the Southeast Polk public school system, but excluding
boarding schools, nursery schools and child care centers, provided that all
principal buildings are set back a minimum of 50 feet from all property lines.
   H.   Any use that is approved and made a part of the Development Plan,
subject to any conditions attached thereto, shall be permitted.
2.   Permitted Accessory Uses.
   A.   Uses of land and or structures customarily incidental and subordinate
to one of the principal permitted uses, unless otherwise excluded.
   B.   Temporary buildings for uses incidental to construction work, which
buildings shall be removed upon the completion or abandonment of the
construction work.
   C.   Private swimming pools when enclosed by a non-climbable fence at least
six feet in height.
   D.   TV Dish Antennas in accordance with Chapter 168 of the Zoning Code -
General Regulations.
3.   Permitted Conditional Uses.
   A.   Home occupations. A conditional use permit must be applied for and
received from the Board of Adjustment for a home occupation which does not meet
the requirements set forth in Chapter 168 of the Zoning Code - General
Regulations.
   B.   Communication towers (freestanding type), see Chapter 168 of the Zoning
Code - General Regulations.
   C.   Communication towers of the building-supported type, see Chapter 168.13
of the Zoning Code - General Regulations.
   D.   Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS), see Chapter 168 of the Zoning
Code - General Regulations.
4.   Bulk Regulations. Although a P.U.D. is intended to promote and permit
flexibility of design and thereby may involve modifications of conventional
regulations or standards, certain requirements which are set forth below shall
be applied to ensure that the development is compatible with the intent of this
zoning ordinance. Height, setback, bulk, and other requirements set out in the
Development Plan shall constitute the basis for and become the zoning
requirement for that particular P.U.D., provided that refinements may be made
through final plan approval if not defined as a substantial modification. In
addition, the following minimum requirements shall be observed.
   A.   The minimum lot and yard requirements of the original zoning
designation of the development need not apply. The Council may require open
space or screenings be located along all or a portion of the development
boundaries.
   B.   The height requirements of the zoning district directly adjacent to the
development boundary shall apply within 125 feet of the development boundary
and land.
   C.   All public streets, water mains, sanitary sewer and storm sewer
facilities shall comply with appropriate ordinances and specifications of the
City.
   D.   “Common land” as referred to in this section refers to the land
retained in private ownership for the use of all residents of the development,
or to land dedicated to the general public.
   E.   Any land gained within the development because of the reduction in lot
sizes below minimum Zoning Code requirements shall be placed in common land to
be dedicated to the City or retained in private ownership to be managed by a
homeowner’s association.
   F.   The requirements of this Zoning Code relating to off-street parking and
loading shall apply to all R-5 Districts.
   G.   The final plan shall comply with the density requirements set forth in
the Development Plan, but shall in no case exceed 20 units per acre.
   H.   Project phases shall be substantially and functionally self-contained
and self-sustaining with regard to access, parking, utilities, required open
space, screening and transitional elements and other support features, and be
capable of supporting required operation and maintenance activities; temporary
provisions, such as turnarounds or access easements, may be required for this
purpose; the initial phases generally should not be comprised of the most
intensive portions of the P.U.D., unless the City concurs this is the most
feasible means of developing the property in terms of access, sewer service, or
similar physical constraints, or will permit earlier development of common
amenities.
   I.   Attention shall be given to mitigation of existing or potential land
use conflicts through proper orientation, open space, setbacks, landscaping and
screening, grading, traffic circulation, and architectural compatibility. It is
the intent of this chapter to recognize that appropriate use of the design
techniques will provide the require mitigation, and thereby eliminate the need
for certain conventional regulations or standards. As examples and not
requirements: orienting views, access, and principal activities away from the
land use needing protection, placing those least compatible activities farthest
from the common boundary and those most compatible nearest, can create an
effective buffer; setbacks in conjunction with landscaping can mitigate
conflicts by providing a visual buffer, controlling pedestrian access,
softening visual contrast by subduing the differences in architecture and mass,
and reducing heat, and dense landscaping can reduce the width of physical
separation needed for such purposes; proper grading will control drainage, can
alter views and subdue sound, and channel access; fences, walls, and berms will
channel access and control visual, sound, and light pollution; proper
architectural use of color, bulk, materials, and shape will enhance
compatibility and reduce contrast, although details added to the building for
aesthetic purpose without consideration to form and surroundings may be
detrimental rather than helpful; and proper design of pedestrian ways, streets

   S.   Signs in accordance with Chapter 165 of this Code.
5.   Procedure.
   A.   Pre-Application Conferences. In order to eliminate unnecessary
expenditures of time and money, the developer shall first schedule a pre-
application conference with the City Administrator, who shall involve
representatives of other Departments as deemed appropriate. The Administrator
may require submittal of a generalized sketch plan providing such information
as follows:
      (1)   Location and size of the overall site, and of the individual types
of development of uses proposed within the site.
      (2)   Existing topography, indicating major earth-work areas, storm water
runoff and detention considerations, floodplains, and any problem areas.
      (3)   Existing tree masses and other geological and environmentally
important characteristics.
      (4)   Generalized vehicular and pedestrian systems and parking areas.
      (5)   Generalized building locations.
      (6)   Approximate gross density, and number and types of dwelling units
“in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan”; approximate gross floor areas of
commercial land uses (where permitted).
      (7)   Generalized utility line considerations with sanitary sewer
capacity limitations so noted.
      (8)   Generalized public and private ownership boundaries, including
common ownership areas, if any.
      (9)   Generalized building locations for small P.U.D. proposals.
City Hall shall have 15 days in which to review and comment on the pre-
application sketch plan. Following City Hall’s review, the developer may
request an informal consideration of the proposal by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Said consideration shall be non-binding on either party.
   B.   Rezoning/Development Plan Application. Following the preapplication
conference the applicant shall submit a petition for rezoning in accordance
with standard City procedures for rezoning, accompanied by a Development Plan
and related documents, as described in subsection 6 of this section. The
petition and Development Plan shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for study and report, and for public hearing as required by this
ordinance for rezoning. The Commission shall review the Development Plan for
conformity to the standards of this section, and may approve the Plan as
submitted; require the petitioner to modify, alter, adjust, or amend the Plan
as deemed necessary to preserve the intent and purpose of this section to
promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare; or recommend that it
be denied. The action of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be reported
to the City Council, where upon the Council may approve or disapprove the
petition and Development Plan as reported or may require such changes thereto
as deemed necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this ordinance.
City Hall shall schedule all required public hearings as soon as possible after
all required information has been submitted. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall report their findings to the City Council in a timely manner. In the
event they fail to take action within 60 days after the date of public hearing,
the petitioner or anyone located within the notification area as defined for
rezoning may request in writing that the Commission complete their
considerations. The Commission shall then take action within the next 30 days
and report their findings to the Council for consideration by the Council,
unless the Council expressly grants the Commission additional time to complete
negotiations, studies, or other items as necessary.
   C.   Final Plans. Final plans for the Planned Unit Development shall be
comprised of site plans and/or preliminary and final subdivision plats as
appropriate to the situation due to requirements of the site planning and
subdivision ordinances or specific provisions of the Development Plan. Such
site plans and plats shall contain all information and be processed in the
manner set forth in said ordinances, in addition to complying with any specific
provisions of the Development Plan, and shall generally comply with the
development concepts outlined in the Development Plan. No public notice or
hearing shall be required for Final Plans unless required by the Development
Plan or caused to be required by the Commission or Council as deemed
appropriate. Provided, deviation from the Development Plan may be permitted as
refinements to the design and planning if not defined by this ordinance as
substantial modification requiring amendment to the Development Plan.
Substantial modifications shall be submitted for approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council. Final plans may cover all or part of the
Planned Unit Development, provided that a final plan covering only a part of a
P.U.D. is hereby defined as a phase irrespective of contrary provisions by the
Development Plan and shall demonstrate the ability to be self-sustaining in
terms of access, services, utilities, open space, economic viability, and other
major consideration. If it is the desire of the petitioner, preliminary plat
and/or final site plan approval may be obtained at the time of Development Plan
approval by expressly declaring such intent and filing all information required
by the Subdivision and Site Planning Ordinances. Final Site Plan approval shall
not be granted for an unplatted parcel unless an accurate property survey is
also filed as part of the preliminary plat if a plat is required, or as a
certified property survey in the event a plat is not required. The final plan
shall include proposed housing, types of housing, locations, density, building
clearances, and documents, per the Bulk Requirements section of this chapter,
so that the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council can adequately review
all aspects of the proposed P.U.D.
Upon approval of final plans, building permits shall be issued in the same
manner as for building permits generally. In any event where platting is
required, no building permits shall be issued until the final plat is approved
and recorded and all other requirements complied with. Final plans shall be
binding on the petitioner and any and all successors in title so long as P.U.D.
zoning applies to the land, unless amended in accordance with the procedures
set forth.
   D.   Amendments or Modifications. Substantial modifications to the Master
Plan shall be processed in the same manner as a rezoning and additionally shall
comply with the application process for a P.U.D. as set forth in this chapter.
Notice and public hearing requirements, and the effect of a denial shall be the
same as for rezoning, provided that the notification area shall be those
property owners proximate to the parcel covered by the amendment, as opposed to
the entire P.U.D.
Further provided that in the event a requested amendment for a portion of the
entire P.U.D. is denied, such action shall not create any limitations under
rezoning procedure on the filling of an amendment to another portion of the
P.U.D. having a substantially different notification area. Any ambiguities or
disputes between this section and procedures for rezoning shall be resolved in
favor of the more restrictive requirements. Substantial modifications are
hereby defined to include, but are not limited to, the following: increased
density; intensification of use by changing to a higher classification, with
conventional single family being the lowest classification and progressing to
attached single-family, multiple-family, public facilities/uses, approved
conditional uses, commercial (where permitted); addition of uses, or
elimination of conditions or restrictions on a use or uses; increased Floor
Area Ratios, or other modifications considered probable to generate increased
traffic, sewage, waste consumption, or other detrimental conditions;
significant modifications to peripheral buffering or screening, setbacks,
height, location of buildings, drives, or other improvements, which were
intended for protection of proximate properties, provided that substitution of
equivalent screening materials shall not be considered a substantial
modification; modifications to the street pattern, such as that of major
streets or continuations of existing streets which will have a demonstrable
impact on traffic flow such as to effectively change the functional
classification of the street; modifications to access which may lead to
increased congestion, or to additional commercial or industrial traffic on a
local residential street; or other changes deemed substantial by the City
Administrator. Modifications to final plans shall follow the procedures of the
Site Planning or Subdivision Ordinances, as appropriate, except in the case of
a substantial modification as defined above.
6.   Information Required on the Development Plan Application. The following
information, plans and maps shall be submitted as part of the application for a
Planned Unit Development:
   A.   Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of owners, developer, and
designer; name of development, date, north point, and scale.
   B.   Legal description of the P.U.D., and map of the boundary of the
proposed P.U.D. as well as interior boundaries of proposed development phases,
and of any existing separate ownerships.
   C.   Sufficient information on adjacent properties to indicate relationships
to the proposed development, including such information as land divisions, land
use, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, significant natural features or
physical improvements, and drainage pattern.
   D.   Existing site conditions including contours at intervals sufficient to
indicate topographic conditions (generally two feet), drainage ways and 100
year flood plains, floodways, heavy woods or other significant natural areas,
and existing structures.
   E.   General locations of proposed lots and attached residential, multiple
family, commercial (where permitted), recreational facilities; further
delineating areas with different uses or building types, and gross density per
acre.
   F.   General location and size of areas to be dedicated or reserved for
common open space, park, schools, recreation area, and similar uses, and how
any private facilities are proposed to be maintained.
   G.   Existing and proposed general circulation systems, including streets,
pedestrian ways, major off-street parking and loading areas, and major points
of access.
   H.   Existing and proposed general sanitary and storm sewer systems, water
mains, and drainage ways.
   I.   Proposed development standards, including uses, density, floor area
ratios for nonresidential developments, lot areas and widths, setbacks, and
exceptions or variances from general requirements of zoning and other
ordinances.
   J.   Sewer usage computations in accordance with the criteria of the sewer
district.
   K.   Treatment of transitional zones around the perimeter of the project for
protection of adjoining properties, including setbacks and buffer areas,
landscaping, fences or other screening, height limitations, or other
provisions.
   L.   A narrative or graphic explanation of the planning and design concepts
and objectives the owner intends to follow in implementing the proposed
development, including a description of the character of the proposed
development; the rationale behind the assumptions and choices made; the
compatibility with the surrounding area; and design considerations for
architecture, engineering, landscaping, open space, and so forth.
   M.   A statement of intent with regard to selling or leasing all or portions
of the proposed development.
   N.   Proposed energy conservation methods, such as siting or design of
structures.
   O.   Proposed phasing timetable.
The Administrator may require any additional information which may be needed to
evaluate the proposed P.U.D. on the basis of special or unforeseen
circumstances, or may waive any of the above requirements if it is found that
such information is unnecessary to properly evaluate the proposed P.U.D.
The above information should be shown in a clear and logical manner in a
legible scale. Sheet size should not exceed 36 inches by 48 inches. Generally,
existing conditions should be illustrated on a separate sheet for the sake of
clarity, although existing topography, access, utility and sewer lines and
other items that are appropriate for understanding the proposal should also
appear on the proposed development plan. It is strongly recommended that an
architect, landscape architect, and civil engineer be employed to prepare the
plans.
7.   Referral to Council. The Final Plan and required documents shall be
reviewed by the Commission for compliance with the R-5 standards and
substantial compliance with the Development Plan. The Commission’s
recommendations and report on the Final Plan shall be referred to the Council
for final approval. The Final Plan, consisting of a final subdivision plat or
site plan shall be approved by the Council before any building permit is
issued.
8.   Contingent Approval. The Council may make the approval of the development
plan contingent upon the completion of construction and improvements within a
reasonable period of time; provided, however, in the determination of such
period, the Council shall consider the scope and magnitude of the development
project and any schedule of construction and improvements submitted by the
developer. Failure to complete all construction and improvements within said
period of time shall be deemed sufficient cause for the Council to rezone the
unimproved property to the classification effective at the time of original
submission of the development plan, unless an extension as recommended by the
Commission and approved by the Council for due cause is shown. Any proposed
change in the development plan after approval by the Council shall be
resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original proposal. The
term “unimproved property” means all property situated within a stage or stages
of the final development plan upon which the installation of improvements has
not been commenced.
9.   Continuing to Second and Subsequent Stages. In no event shall the
installation of any infrastructure improvements be commenced in the second or
subsequent stages of the final development plan until such time as 90 percent
of all improvements have been completed and approved by the City for any prior
stage. In the event the first development phase has not commenced within two
years after the date of rezoning, or if subsequent phases are delayed more than
two years beyond the indicated development schedule, the developer shall file
appropriate information detailing the reasons for the delay with the City
Administrator. The Administrator shall review the circumstances and prepare
report recommending appropriate action to be taken concerning the P.U.D. The
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall review the matter, and
may continue the P.U.D. zoning with revised time limits; require that
appropriate amendments be made or action taken, such amendments to comply with
the procedures of this section if deemed substantial; continue the P.U.D.
zoning for part of the area, with or without revised time limits, and initiate
rezoning or the remainder to an appropriate district; or initiate rezoning of
the entire parcel to an appropriate district, provided that the rezoning shall
not be to a zone more restrictive than that applied immediately prior to the
rezoning to P.U.D. except after comprehensive planning analysis. The Commission
and Council may schedule such public hearings as deemed appropriate. Approval
of a final site plan or preliminary plat shall be deemed to commence
development, provided that the permanent placement of construction materials
shall have started and be proceeding without delay within two years after the
date of site plan approval, and a final plat approved within one year after the
date of preliminary plat approval in the event a site plan is not required.
Failure to comply with this provision shall void the site plan and preliminary
plat approvals, and make the P.U.D. subject to review as provided above. It
shall be the responsibility of the developer to comply with all prescribed time
limits without notice from the City.
10.   Zoning Density of R-5 Districts. The zoning density of R-5 districts
shall be determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation as
approved or amended or finally passed by the Council; and the density shall be
established and interpreted by the administration of the Zoning Code upon the
basis of the plan for the overall development of the tract as the plan is
approved and filed with the Council on final passage. In determining the
density of the R-5 District, it shall be considered what the zoning is of
adjoining property and the use of adjoining property and density of adjoining
property; however, this policy shall not be binding on the Council in setting
the final density for the R-5 zoned properties. In no case shall an average
density be approved which exceeds 20 dwelling units per acre. Each parcel of
real estate that is zoned R-5 must have its density determined on the merits of
each case. Any real estate zoned R-5 prior to the enactment of the ordinance
codified herein shall be bound by the density that is shown in the plans as
accepted and approved by the Council for the development of said real estate.
169.08   C-l RESIDENTIAL-COMMERCIAL.

169.10   C-3 PLANNED COMMERCIAL.
The C-3 District is intended to provide for the development of shopping
centers. For the purposes of this section, the term “shopping center” means a
planned retail and service area under single ownership, management, or control
characterized by a concentrated grouping of stores and compatible uses, with
various facilities designed to be used in common, such as ingress and egress
roads, extensive parking accommodations, etc. Since shopping center
developments, whether large or small, have a significant effect upon the
comprehensive plan for the development of the City, extensive authority over
their development is retained by the Council and the Planning Commission. Many
matters relating to the shopping center’s design, its potential for success or
failure and its effect upon surrounding neighborhoods must be considered by the
Council and Commission in order to be reasonably assured that the area will not
eventually become blighted. It is further intended that in the event of an
applicant’s failure to construct a shopping center in accordance with a
reasonable time schedule, the Council shall enact the necessary legislation to
reclassify the area to another classification consistent with the surrounding
neighborhood. Such action would also, because of the reduction in commercial
zoning in a given area, provide conditions whereby it could be reasonable for
the Council to classify other areas in the vicinity for shopping center use.
1.   Procedures. The owner or owners of any tract of land comprising an area of
not less than five acres may submit to the Council a petition requesting a
change to the C-3 zoning district classification. The petition shall be
accompanied by a plan for the commercial use and development of the tract for
the purposes of meeting the requirements of this section and by evidence of the
feasibility of the project and its effects on surrounding property, including
each of the following:
   A.   A site plan defining the areas to be developed for buildings, the areas
to be developed for parking, the location of sidewalks and driveways and the
points of ingress and egress, including access streets where required, the
location and height of walls, existing and proposed grades, the location and
type of landscaping and the location, size and number of signs, type or style
of architecture, building material, color or other significant feature.
   B.   An analysis of market conditions in the area to be served, including
types and amount of service needed and general economic justification.
   C.   A traffic analysis of the vicinity indicating the effect of the
proposed shopping center on the adjacent streets.
   D.   A statement of financial responsibility to assure construction of the
shopping center, including landscaping, in accordance with the plan and the
requirements of this section.
   E.   The development plan shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for study and report. The Planning Commission shall review the
conformity of the proposed development with the standards of the Comprehensive
Plan, and with recognized principles of civic design, land use planning and
landscape architecture. The Commission may approve the plan as submitted or,
before approval, may require that the applicant modify, alter, adjust, or amend
the plan as the Commission deems necessary to the end that it preserve the
intent and purpose of this Zoning Code to promote public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare. The development plan as approved by the Commission
shall then be reported to the Council, whereupon the Council may approve or
disapprove said plan as reported or may require such changes thereto as it
deems necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code.

170.01   SITE PLANS.
To assure that the design and location of commercial and industrial areas will
be in conformance with the zoning standards of this Zoning Code and are
properly related to and in harmony with the existing and future business and
industrial development of the City, including generally accepted principles of
commercial, industrial and civic design, a detailed site plan shall be
submitted showing the proposed use and development of all commercial and
industrial sites for recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission to
the Council for their approval.
1.   Procedure.
   A.   A site plan review is required whenever a person or other group wishes
to develop any tract or parcel of land within all zoning districts, except for
any detached single-family residence and two-family residences including any
accessory structure thereto; agriculturally zoned property; new construction of
nonresidential accessory buildings less than 1,000 square feet in gross floor
area; and additions to existing nonresidential buildings when the addition is
less than 10 percent of the existing building’s gross floor area or the
addition does not exceed 1,000 square feet, whichever is more restrictive; and
also where no new curb cuts are required and where new construction does not
reduce existing parking or significantly modify existing on-site circulation as
determined by the City Engineer. Said person shall cause to be prepared a site
plan of such development, with associated utilities’ approvals or
recommendations attached, and shall submit 14 copies of said site plan to the
City Clerk. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to the
redevelopment, enlargement, or extension of any commercial or industrial uses
and structures existing at the time of adoption of the zoning ordinance (August
4, 2003). The site plan shall contain such information and data as outlined
herein.
   B.   The Clerk shall refer a copy of the site plan to the City Engineer, or
such other person as shall be designated from time to time by the Council, who
shall review said site plan as to its compliance with the ordinances of the
City, its effect upon public utilities and the public street system, and submit
findings as soon as possible to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   C.   The Clerk shall also forward a copy of the site plan to each member of
the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission shall, after receiving the
engineer’s report, review the site plan for conformity with the regulations and
design standards contained herein, and may confer with the developer on changes
deemed advisable in such site plan.
   D.   The Commission shall forward its recommendation of action to the Clerk
within 45 days of the date of submission of the site plan to the Commission. If
the Commission does not act within 45 days, the site plan shall be deemed to be
approved by the Commission unless the developer agrees to an extension of time.
   E.   The Commission may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing on the
site plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and to
whom such notice shall be given.
   F.   The Council shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Commission, either approve or disapprove the site plan of the proposed
development.
   G.   No building permit or certificate of occupancy for any structure within
any district within which a site plan is required shall be issued until the
site plan has been approved as provided herein.
   H.   Upon final action by the Commission on any site plan, a copy of said
site plan with the action of the Commission noted thereon and signed by the
Chairman of the Commission shall be filed with the Clerk.
   I.   If the administrative official finds that any construction or proposed
construction or occupancy of a development on a tract of land for which a site
plan has been approved will not substantially comply with the site plan as
approved, or if the administrative official finds that the construction and
development of the tract is not being carried out in accordance with the
development schedule filed with the site plan, the administrative official
shall suspend all building permits for the development and order all
construction stopped until such time as the owner of the project or any
successors in interest shall have provided the administrative official with
proof satisfactory to said administrative official that the site plan will be
complied with. The administrative official shall not issue a certificate of
occupancy for any structure within the development while the building permit
for the development has been suspended pursuant to this paragraph. Any person
aggrieved by any decision or action of the administrative official under this
section may appeal such action or decision to the Board of Adjustment.
   J.   If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a site plan has
been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or that a
modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate or more
practicable development of the site, the owner or developer may apply for an
amendment of the site plan. The Commission may grant an extension of time or a
modification of a previously approved site plan if it determines that such
modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate development
of the site.
   K.   Preapplication Conference. Whenever any person, partnership,
corporation or any other group, public or private, proposed to develop any
tract or parcel of land or modify any existing development which requires a
site plan submittal, a request shall be made to the Zoning Administrator for a
preapplication conference. The conference shall include the applicant or
representative, the Zoning Administrator, the City Engineer, The City Building
Inspector, and the Public Works Director. The purpose of the conference shall
be to acquaint the City Staff with proposed development and to acquaint the
applicant or representative with the procedures and with any special problems
that might relate to the development. The applicant shall furnish a legal
description of the property to be developed at the time of requesting the
preapplication conference, and the conference shall be held within 15 days of
such request.
2.   Design Standards. The standards of design are intended as minimum
requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of the development
requiring the site plan may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances.
   A.   All proposed developments for which site plans are required shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan of the City; the provisions of this Zoning
Code, the Subdivision Regulations, if applicable; and all other applicable City
ordinances and statutes and regulations of the State.
   B.   The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon
public streets as are necessary for safety and the general welfare and shall
have such interior drives as are necessary for free movement of emergency
vehicles; and shall have such pedestrian walkways as are necessary for safety
and general welfare. The proposed development shall have such entrances and
exits upon adjacent streets and such internal traffic circulation pattern as
will not unduly increase congestion on adjacent or surrounding public streets
or create undue hazards to traffic safety.
   C.   The proposed development shall be designed with a proper regard to
topography, surface drainage, natural drains and streams, wooded areas, and
other natural features which will lend themselves to proper, harmonious and
attractive development of the site. The design of the proposed improvements
shall make adequate provisions for surface and subsurface drainage, for
connections to water and sanitary sewer lines, each so designed as to neither
overload existing public utility lines nor increase the danger of erosion,
flooding, landslide, or other endangerment of adjoining or surrounding
property.
   D.   The proposed development shall be designed with adequate water mains,
provisions for sanitary sewage facilities, storm sewers (storm sewers to be
designed for five-year storm calculations) and drains and flood control, in
accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City and statutes and
regulations of the State and good engineering practice to protect the public
health and welfare and not overload any existing public utilities. Surface
drainage shall be directed to storm sewers wherever practical, including the
requirement to extend public storm sewer if deemed necessary.
   E.   The proposed development shall be designed and the buildings and
improvements located in such a manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the
use and enjoyment of adjoining or surrounding property and to such end shall
have such buffers, screen fences and landscaping as may be proper and shall
minimize the adverse effects on such adjoining property from automobile
headlights, illuminations of required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and
impairment of light and air. For the purpose of this section, the term “use and
enjoyment of adjoining property” means the use and enjoyment presently being
made of such adjoining property, unless such property is vacant. If vacant, the
term “use and enjoyment of adjoining property” means those uses permitted under
the zoning districts in which such adjoining property is located.
   F.   The proposed development shall not unduly increase the public danger of
fire or diminish the public safety, and shall be designed to adequately
safeguard the health, safety and general welfare of the public and of persons
residing and working in the development and in the adjoining or surrounding
property.
   G.   The proposed development and all structures therein shall be designed
in such a manner as to create a quality environment and to such end shall be
architecturally and aesthetically harmonious and attractive.
   H.   To such end as may be necessary and proper to accomplish the design
standards of this section, a landscaping plan prepared by a registered
landscape architect, nursery person or such other knowledgeable person shall be
provided, along with plans which address erosion control and other applicable
requirements of this chapter and other City regulations.
3.   Site Plan Requirements. All site plans shall be drawn at a scale not less
than one inch equals 50 feet. Fourteen (14) copies of the site plan shall be
submitted to the Clerk. The purpose of the site plan is to show all information
needed to enable the engineer, Commission and the Council to determine if the
proposed development meets the requirements of this Zoning Code.

construction provided for in a site plan expires or is canceled, then such site
plan approval shall thereupon terminate.
170.02   SCREENING.
1.   Intent. The intent of screening regulations is to lessen the transmission
from one lot to another of noise, dust and glare; to lessen visual pollution by
providing an impression of separation of spaces or entirely shielding one land
use from another; and/or establishing a sense of privacy from visual or
physical intrusion. The provisions of this chapter are necessary to safeguard
the public health, safety and welfare.
2.   General Screening. Every development shall provide sufficient screening so
that neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of
that development; and the development is shielded from the negative impacts of
adjacent uses including streets and railroads.
3.   Compliance with General Standard. The following table illustrates the type
of screen required between zoning classifications. Where such screening is
required the applicant or burdened use is responsible for installation prior to
receiving an occupancy permit for the use in questions. A description of the
screen types (A, B and C) are described in the following subsection. Where
screening is to be approved at site plan review (*), the screening objectives
described in this section are to be adhered to. The City Council may require
additional screening where deemed appropriate.

A, B, C Described below.
 
4.   Descriptions of Screens. The following three basic types of screens are
established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements.
   A.   Broken Screen, Type A.
A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a
height of at least 20 feet. The broken screen is intended to create the
impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual
contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped
earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted
vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the
average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field
observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain deciduous plants.
   B.   Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B.
A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet, with
intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at
least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual
contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of
spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped
earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted
vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the
average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field
observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent
visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings
more than 10 feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain
deciduous plants.
   C.   Opaque Screen, Type C.
A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet, with
intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at
least 20 feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact
between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The
opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted
vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or
natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and
density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing
vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of
the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should
not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The
portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants.
5.   Storage Areas. The outdoor storage of materials, equipment or supplies,
when permitted in any commercial or industrial district, shall be so located or
screened, fenced or landscaped so as to effectively prevent visibility of such
storage from all abutting residential zoning districts or abutting existing
residential uses. Such screening shall be sufficient if it prevents visibility
of such storage area by persons traveling on public rights-of-way or standing
at grade level on the side or rear lot lines of such property. Such screening
shall comply with the standard for an opaque screen Type C as described in
paragraph 4(C) of this section.
6.   Mechanical Units. The following standards apply to the location and
screening of mechanical equipment.
   A.   Screening of Ground Mounted Mechanical Units. For all uses requiring
the submittal of a site plan, all ground-mounted mechanical units, including
(but not limited to) air-conditioning condensers, heat pumps, ventilation
units, computer cooling equipment, etc., and any related utility structures and
equipment, that are visible from any adjacent public thoroughfare shall be
visibly screened from public view by the use of a screening wall built out of
materials compatible and consistent with the architecture and materials of the
principal building, landscape plantings of predominantly evergreen materials to
provide year-round screening, or a combination of the above. The type of
screening shall be identified as part of the site plan.
   B.   Screening of Roof Mounted Mechanical Units. All roof-mounted mechanical
units shall be screened from adjacent public thoroughfares by the use of an
opaque screening material compatible with the architecture of the building or
architecturally designed screening, such as a parapet wall. The screening of
the roof-mounted units shall be designed to blend with the building and roof
materials. Additional screening may be required due to topographic differences
in adjoining properties.
   C.   Screening of Trash Receptacles. For any development of properties where
three or more residential dwelling units are using a common trash receptacle
and all nonresidential uses; trash receptacles and dumpsters shall be screened
on all sides by the use of a permanent enclosure, with gates for disposal truck
access.
      (1)   The enclosure shall be constructed to visibly screen the receptacle
from public view and views from the adjoining properties.
      (2)   The screening wall shall be constructed of permanent materials,
such as block or brick (wood is not permitted), compatible and consistent with
the architecture and materials of the principal building.
      (3)   The enclosure shall be landscaped to minimize the visual impact of
the enclosure on surrounding properties and public thoroughfares.
      (4)   A gate is required for all enclosures. The gate must be constructed
with a metal frame (wood is not permitted). The gate must be covered with an
opaque material, such as wood, to screen the contents of the enclosure.
      (5)   Concrete-filled steel pipe bollards must be used to protect the
enclosure.
170.03   CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
1.   No land shall be occupied or used, and no building hereafter erected or
portion thereof being structurally altered shall be occupied or used in whole
or in part for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate is issued by the
administrative official stating that the building and use comply with the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
2.   No change of use shall be made in any building or part thereof, now or
hereafter erected or structurally altered, without a permit being issued
therefor by the administrative official. No permit shall be issued to make a
change unless the changes are in conformity with provisions of this Zoning
Code.
3.   Applications for certificates of occupancy shall be applied for
coincidentally with the application for a building permit and shall be issued
within 10 days after the lawful erection or alteration of the building is
completed. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file at City Hall and
copies shall be furnished on request to any person having a proprietary or
tenancy interest in the building affected.
4.   No permit for excavation for, or the erection or alteration of any
building shall be issued before the application has been made for a certificate
of occupancy, and no building or premises shall be occupied until that
certificate is issued.
5.   A certificate of nonconforming uses shall be required of all nonconforming
uses. Application for a certificate for nonconforming uses shall be filed with
the administrative official within 12 months from the effective date of the
ordinance codified herein, accompanied by affidavits of proof that such
nonconforming use was not established in violation of previous ordinance.
170.04   AMENDMENTS.
1.   The Council may, from time to time, on its own action or on petition,
amend, supplement, or change the boundaries or regulations herein or
subsequently established. However, no such amendment, supplement, restriction,
change of boundaries, or regulations shall become effective until after a
public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens
shall have an opportunity to be heard. The notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be published as provided in Section 362.3 of the Code of Iowa,
except that at least seven days’ notice must be given and in no case shall the
public hearing be held earlier than the next regularly scheduled Council
meeting following the published notice. The notice shall be published in a
paper of general circulation in the City. Such amendment, supplement, or change
shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of a majority of all of
the members of the Council. In case, however, of a written protest against a
change or repeal which is filed with the Clerk and signed by the owners of 20
percent or more of the area of the lots included in the proposed change or
repeal, or by the owners of 20 percent or more of the property which is located
within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the change
or repeal is proposed, the change or repeal shall not become effective except
by the favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all of the members of the
Council. The provisions of Section 414.4 of the Code of Iowa relative to public
hearings and official notice apply equally to all changes or amendments.
2.   Whenever any person desires that any amendment or change be made in this
Zoning Code, including the text and/or map, as to any property in the City, it
shall be by written petition to the City Council. The petition requesting such
change or amendment shall clearly describe the property and its boundaries as
to which the change or amendment is desired and shall be duly signed by the
owners of 50 percent of the area of all real estate included within the
boundaries of said tract as described in said petition. Also, it shall be duly
signed by the owners of 50 percent of the area of all real estate lying outside
of said tract but within 200 feet of the boundaries thereof (intervening
streets and alleys not to be included in computing such 200 feet). It shall be
the duty of the Council to vote upon such petition within 90 days after the
filing of such petition with the Clerk.
3.   Before any action shall be taken as provided in this section, the party or
parties proposing or recommending a change in the district boundaries shall
deposit with the City Clerk the sum of $75.00 to cover the approximate costs of
this procedure. Under no condition shall said sum or any part thereof, be
refunded for failure of said amendment to be enacted into law.
4.   Whenever any petition for an amendment, supplement, or change of the
zoning regulations herein contained or subsequently established shall have been
denied by the Council, then no new petition for the same property or any part
thereof shall be filed with or considered by the City until one year after the
date of the filing of the first petition.
170.05   COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
Whenever a violation of this Zoning Code occurs, or is alleged to have
occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint stating fully
the causes and basis thereof shall be filed with the administrative official.
Said administrative official shall record properly such complaint, immediately
investigate and take action thereon as provided by this Zoning Code.
170.06   ENFORCEMENT; PENALTIES.
1.   Enforcement. All departments, officials and employees of the City who are
vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses shall issue no
such permit or license for any use, structure or purpose if the same would not
conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
2.   Penalties for Violation. The owner or tenant of any building, structure,
premises or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or
other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains a violation
of the provisions of this Zoning Code may each be found guilty of a separate
offense and suffer the penalties provided in this Code of Ordinances. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the
Board that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to
the Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown.
2.   Powers and Duties. The Board has the following powers and duties:

order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator
in the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance.
   B.   To grant a variance from the terms of this ordinance when a property
owner can show that their property was acquired in good faith and where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of
property or where by reason of exceptional topography, conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional situation, the strict application of the terms of
this ordinance actually prohibits the use of their property in a manner
reasonably similar to that of other property in the same district and where the
Board is satisfied under the evidence before it, that:
      (1)   The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only
for a purpose allowed in the district in which it is located.
      (2)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
      (3)   The plight of the owner of the land in question is due to the
unique circumstances shown to the Board and is not of the owner’s making.
      (4)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the appellant
any special privilege that is denied to other lands, structures or buildings in
the same district by this ordinance.
      (5)   The use to be authorized by the variation will not alter the
essential character of the district in which the property is located.
      (6)   All variations granted under this provision are in harmony with the
intended spirit and purpose of this ordinance and shall not be injurious to the
surrounding property or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
A variance shall not be granted by the Board unless and until a public hearing
is held. Notice of said public hearing shall be provided in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City at least 15 days prior to such hearing. The
owner (agent) of the property for which the variance is sought and the owners
of any other affected property within 200 feet of said property shall be
notified by mail. Further provided that no variance shall be granted unless the
Board shall make findings that the requirements of this section have been met
by the applicant for the variance and that the reasons set forth in the
application justify the granting of the variance. In granting any variance, the
Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with
this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this zoning ordinance and punishable under appropriate provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance. Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to
allow a use not permissible under the terms of this ordinance in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication, prohibited by the terms of
this ordinance in said district.
   C.   To permit the following exceptions to the district regulations set
forth in this Zoning Ordinance, provided all exceptions:
      (1)   Are so designed, constructed and operated to adequately safeguard
the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding
property.
      (2)   Do not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property.
      (3)   Do not increase congestion in the public streets.
      (4)   Do not increase public danger of fire or flood.
      (5)   Do not diminish or impair established property value in surrounding
areas.

public convenience or welfare.
   E.   To permit the extension of zoning district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot in single ownership as shown on record or by existing
contract or purchase at the time of the passage of this ordinance, but in no
case shall such extension of the district boundary line exceed 40 feet in any
direction.
   F.   To hear and decide such other special exceptions as the Board is
specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this ordinance; to decide
such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should
be granted; and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards
as are appropriate with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance. A
special exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:
      (1)   A written application for special exception is submitted indicating
the specific provision of this Zoning Ordinance under which the special
exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
      (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given in advance of public
hearing by publication of such notice in a newspaper of general circulation
within the City at least 15 days prior to such hearing. The owner (or agent) of
the property for which the special exception is sought and the owners of any
other affected property within 200 feet of said property shall be notified by
mail. Notice of hearing may also be posted on the property for which the
special exception is sought.
      (3)   At the public hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney.

public interest.
   G.   To hear and decide only the conditional uses specifically authorized in
this Zoning Ordinance and only within the zoning districts where such
conditional uses are specifically listed.
In granting any special exception, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance. Violations
of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which
the conditional use permit is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
Zoning Ordinance. The Board may prescribe a time limit within the action for
which the special exception is required shall have be began or completed or
both. Failure to begin, complete, or both, such action within this time limit
set, shall void the special exception.
3.   Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
   A.   In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may, in conformity
with the provisions of law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly or modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such
order, requirement, decision of determinations as it believes to be proper. The
concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator, or

175.06 thereof.
2.   The Clerk shall immediately refer copies of the preliminary plat to the
Commission and to the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall carefully examine
said plat as to its compliance with this Code of Ordinances, the existing
street system, and good engineering practices, and shall, as soon as possible,
submit their findings to the Commission.
3.   After receiving the Engineer’s report, the Commission shall study the
preliminary plat and other material for conformity to these regulations. The
Commission may confer with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the
kind and extent of such improvements to be made. Before approving a preliminary
plan, the Commission may (at its discretion) hold a public hearing on the
proposed plat, notice of which shall be given by publication in a local
newspaper of general circulation, or by posting notices on the tract, or by
sending notices to affected property owners by mail. Such notice shall be given

said preliminary plat approval.
5.   Approval of the final plat and final acceptance of improvements shall be
given by resolution of the Council which shall direct the Mayor and Clerk to
certify the resolution which shall be affixed to the plat. Procedure for
approval of the final plat shall be as outlined in Section
175.05(5) of this chapter.
175.05   SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of a plat, the subdivider shall use standards consistent
with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant, and durable
neighborhood.
1.   Streets.
   A.   Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall conform
to the Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall also
conform to additional proposed street plans as set out by the City.
   B.   Continuation of Existing or Planned Streets. Proposed streets shall
provide for continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or
recorded) or any streets which are a part of an approved preliminary
subdivision plan, in adjoining property, at equal or greater width, but not
less than 60 feet in width, and in similar alignment, unless variations are
recommended by the Commission.
   C.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the Commission. In a
case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat, but is
temporarily dead-ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
   D.   Street Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as possible.
   E.   Culs-de-Sac. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be
no longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having a street property line radius of at least 52 feet in the case
of residential subdivisions. The closed end of a commercial or industrial
street shall be provided with a turnaround having a street property line radius
of at least 55 feet. The right-of-way width of the street leading to the
turnaround shall be a minimum of 60 feet. The property lines at the
intersection of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be
rounded at a radius of not less than 150 feet; or equal straight approach
lines. The pavement width for turnarounds shall be a minimum radius of 40 feet
for residential and 45 feet for commercial or industrial. A turnaround diameter
greater than the minimum may be required by the Commission if it is deemed
necessary.
   F.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named in a manner
conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
logically be extended although the various portions be at a considerable
distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall
be subject to the approval of the Commission in order to avoid duplication or
close similarity of names.
   G.   Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted
with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
   H.   Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will NOT be permitted. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract
of land to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary
by the Commission.
   I.   Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a
means of turning around at the dead end thereof.
   J.   Easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear or side
lot lines or along alleys, if needed. Whenever any stream or important surface
water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at his own expense, make adequate provision for widening the channel so
that it will properly carry the surface water, and shall provide and dedicate
to the City an easement along each side of the stream, which easement shall be
for the purpose of widening, improving, or protecting the stream and for the
purpose of installation of public utilities. The waterway easements shall be
approved by the City Engineer. The total width of the easement shall be
adequate to provide for these purposes, and said easement shall be a minimum of
50 feet on each side of the centerline of the stream or water course.
   K.   Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been made by the Commission
for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located, the street
system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
   L.   Land Not Platted. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of
the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require topography and a
sketch of a tentative future street system of the unsubdivided portion.
   M.   Major Thoroughfares. Where a new subdivision, except where justified by
limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy trafficway, the street layout
shall provide motor access to such frontage by one of the following means:
      (1)   A parallel street supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
traffic way.
      (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned at
right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing onto
the highway.
      (3)   An access drive separated by a planting strip from the highway to
which a motor access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced.
      (4)   A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots. Where any one of
the above mentioned arrangements is used, deed covenants or other means shall
prevent any private residential driveways from having direct access to the
trafficway.
   N.   Dedication. A deed to the City shall be given for all streets before
the same will be accepted by the City for maintenance.
   O.   Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan should:
      (1)   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings of the railroad.
      (2)   Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient distance
from it to permit deep lots to go back onto the railroad, or form a buffer
strip for park, commercial, or industrial use.
      (3)   Provide culs-de-sac at right angles to the railroad so as to permit
lots to back thereunto.
   P.   Street Widths. Streets shall be classified as arterial, collector, or
local according to the comprehensive plan. Street widths for arterials and
collectors must conform to the Des Moines Metropolitan Design Standards Manual
according to classification. Local streets shall be a minimum width of 26 feet
from and to the backs of curbs.
   Q.   Street Grades. Street grades shall be conforming with the requirements
set forth in the Des Moines Metropolitan Design Standards Manual. The following
table describes the maximum grades permitted as a percent.
      MAXIMUM GRADES (percent)
 
        Arterials   Collectors  Local
Terrain Major Minor Major Minor
Flat    5     5     5     6     6
Rolling 6     6     7     7     8
Hilly   6     7     8     8     9
 
The above maximum grades are based on terrain and the type of roadway. Where
topography or circumstance demands that grades be steeper than the allowed
maximum, a recommendation shall be obtained from the Jurisdictional Engineer.
   R.   Private Streets. Private streets shall be permitted in the R-3 District
for condominium developments, pertinent to the following requirements:
      (1)   Minimum width of 26 feet from back of curb to back of curb must be
used where access is provided to more than 24 units.
      (2)   A private street which is closed at one end shall be no longer than
600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a cul-de-sac or
hammerhead turnaround.
2.   Blocks.
   A.   Length. No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet. The distance of 1,320
may be reduced by the City if it is considered to be excessive in its
particular application.
   B.   Block Corner Radius. At street intersections, block corners shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than 15 feet, unless at any one intersection
a curve radius has been previously established, then such radius shall be used
as standard.
3.   Lots.
   A.   Corner Lots - Widths. Corner lots shall have a minimum width of 80 feet
in order to permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side streets.
   B.   Double Frontage Lots/Prohibited. Double frontage lots, other than
corner lots, shall be prohibited except where such lots back onto a major
street or highway or except in the case of large commercial or industrial lots.
   C.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
to the street or radial to curved streets.
   D.   Lot Size. All lots shall conform to the lot dimensions and area minimum
as set forth in the applicable zoning district. Where public sewer is not
available and for the purpose of complying with minimum health standards, lots
which cannot be reasonably served by an existing public sanitary sewer system
shall have a minimum width of 100 feet, measured at the building line, and an
area of not less than 20,000 square feet.
   E.   Flat Lots. Flag lots shall not be created, except where approved by
site plan. Existing flag lots shall be re-subdivided prior to issuance of a
building permit.
   F.   Street Access. Each lot shall have satisfactory access to an existing,
paved public street, by means of frontage or easement.
4.   Improvements.

required by this chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and
constructed in accordance with the Des Moines Metro Design Standards and the
City’s Standard Public Works Specifications on file in the office of the Clerk,
under the supervision of the Council and to its satisfaction. Inspection shall
be provided by the City, at the subdivider’s expense, as deemed necessary to
assure quality workmanship on all portions of the construction to be dedicated
to the City. Said inspection costs shall be paid by the subdivider before final
approval will be given.
   B.   Grades. All streets, alleys, and sidewalks within the platted area
which are dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade approved by
the Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the City
Engineer.
   C.   Paving. All paving of roadways constructed for public use will be
installed in accordance with the Des Moines Metro Design Standards and at
grades approved by the City Engineer. Pavement type may be based on
characteristics of the roadway.
   D.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all streets
being dedicated for public use. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet in
width and shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete in accordance with
designs and specifications approved by the Council and at grades approved by
the City Engineer.
   E.   Water and Sewers. Water mains, sanitary sewer lines and storm sewers
and their appurtenances shall be constructed and installed in accordance with
the Des Moines Metro Design Standards and the plans and specifications adopted
by the Council. Water and sewer lines shall be made accessible to each lot. At
a minimum, water mains shall be eight inches in size, hydrants shall not be
farther apart than 350 feet, and storm sewers shall be designed for five-year
storms.
   F.   Underground Utilities. Improvements such as cable TV, telephone and
electric lines, street lights, gas mains, and similar facilities in any
subdivision shall be installed where necessary in any subdivision addition to
the City and all utility lines except electric lines of nominal voltage in
excess of 15,000 volts, shall be installed underground. The subdivider shall be
responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the utility companies
for installation of such facilities. Said utility lines shall be installed in
accordance with the Des Moines Metro Design Standards and in such a manner so
as not to interfere with other underground utilities. Underground utility lines
which cross underneath the right-of-way of any street, alley or way shall be
installed prior to the improvement of any such street, alley or way in the
subdivision. Incidental appurtenances, such as transformers and their
enclosures, pedestal mounted terminal boxes, meters and meter cabinets may be
placed above ground but shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous
to the public. Such incidental appurtenances shall be in accordance with the
standards and specifications of the City Engineer.
   G.   Homeowners Association. A Homeowners Association shall be created for
any development with privately owned streets, utilities, open space, or other
private service which is utilized by more than one homeowner. Any changes in
the responsibilities of the Homeowners Association shall require approval of
City Council.
5.   Approval of Final Plat and Final Acceptance of Improvements.
   A.   Construction of Improvement or Posting of Bond. Before the Council
approves the final plat, all of the foregoing improvements shall be constructed
and accepted by formal resolution of the Council. Before passage of said
Resolution of Acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said improvements
meet all City specifications and ordinances or other requirements, and all
agreements between the subdivider and the City; and the City Attorney shall
report that the subdivision owner has filed in proper form a maintenance bond
(or bonds) to cover all construction being dedicated to the City. Maintenance
bonds shall be in the name of contractors who have done the work. Maintenance
bonds shall be in effect from passage of resolution of acceptance by the
Council, then for the following number of years:
      (1)   Concrete paving   4 years
      (2)   Storm sewers and appurtenances   4 years
      (3)   Sanitary sewers and appurtenances   4 years
      (4)   Water mains and appurtenances   4 years
This requirement for the construction of all improvements may be waived if the
subdivider will post, a performance bond or certified check with the Council
guaranteeing that said improvements will be constructed within a period of one
year from Council’s acceptance of the final plat. However, if a performance
bond is posted, final acceptance of the plat will not constitute final
acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed. Improvements will
be accepted only after their construction has been completed all in accordance
with the rules above outlined. No maintenance work will be done by the City and
no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the City.
   B.   Resubdivisions. The Council may waive the requirements for the
construction and installation of some or all of the foregoing improvements in
cases of resubdivisions where only the size, shape and arrangement of lots is
being changed and no new streets are required and in case of dedications of
land or rights-of-way to public use where such dedication is in excess of the
needs of the subdivision and is desired by a public agency in lieu of a
purchase or condemnation proceeding.

175.12   PUBLIC PARKLAND DEDICATION.
The dedication of public park land is being required to insure that land is
properly located and preserved for park and recreational purposes to serve
future community growth.
1.   Requirement. The development of any property for residential purposes
shall be required to dedicate public parkland. No new plats or site plans for
residential development shall be approved unless the provisions of this section
are complied with.
2.   Definitions. As used in Section
175.12, the following terms have the following definitions:
   A.   “Developer” means any person, individual, firm, partnership,
association, corporation, estate, trust, or other entity proposing to subdivide
or build on land to construct residential dwellings.
   B.   “Minor subdivision” means a subdivision with no proposed streets and
fewer than four lots.
   C.   “Multi-family” means a dwelling designed for or occupied by three (3)
or more families with separate cooking facilities for each. Multi-family for
the purposes of park dedication regulations excludes triplexes and townhomes.
   D.   “Park” means an area of land set aside for public use and maintained
for recreational purposes.
3.   Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from the public parkland
dedication requirements as long as a claim for exemption is made no later than
the time of preliminary plat or site plan application.
   A.   Developments that do not include residential units.
   B.   Minor subdivisions.
   C.   Alterations or expansions of an existing building where no residential
units are created and where the use is not changed. This includes the
replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building or structure with a
new building or structure of the same size and use.
   D.   The construction of accessory buildings or structures.
   E.   Developments with existing plats, site plans, or building permits that
have received approval prior to the enactment of Section
175.12.
   F.   Any non-residential uses that are part of a plat or site plan with
mixed uses.
4.   Change of Use. In the case of a change or use, redevelopment, or expansion
which requires the approval of an amended plat or site plan, the park
dedication requirements shall be based on the new lots or new units being
proposed.
5.   Amount to be Dedicated. This subsection shall prescribe the minimum amount
of space to be provided for public park purposes in each proposed development.
The amount of parkland dedication is identified by multiplying the amount of
park dedication per resident by the development population.
   A.   Park Dedication Per Resident. The City seeks to provide 5 acres of
public parkland per 1,000 residents. This is equivalent to 0.005 acres of
parkland per resident.
   B.   Development Population. The City has determined that the average number
of people per dwelling unit varies based on the dwelling unit type. Thus, in
order to calculate how many people will be residing in a proposed development
the developer must multiply the number of planned dwelling units of each type
by the average number of people per unit as identified in the following table:
 
Dwelling Unit Type                                              Population/Unit
Single-Family Detached, Single-Family Attached, Duplex, Triplex 3.0
Townhome or Mobile Home
Mutli-Family                                                    2.0
 
   C.   Calculation. To determine the required parkland for each development,
the developer shall take the park dedication per resident identified in A above
and multiply it by the proposed development population calculated in B above.
For illustration purposes only:
   0.005 acres/individual X 225 people (75 lots x 3.0 people/unit) = 1.125
acres.
6.   Acceptable Land Defined. When a developer is dedicating parkland, the
slope, topography, and geology of the dedicated site as well as its
surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose. While wetlands,
floodplains, floodways, stormwater detention areas/ponds, and steep slopes may
be accepted for City ownership and maintenance, such areas shall not serve as a
credit toward parkland dedication. At a minimum, 75% of the area to be
dedicated shall be capable of development as active recreation area as
determined by it being sufficiently level and uninterrupted by public or
private utilities, streams, and drainage ditches.
7.   Payment in Lieu of Parkland. In lieu of dedicating parkland, the developer
may request the ability to make a cash payment. The City Council shall evaluate
this request giving due consideration to all of the factors listed in Section
8A. The donation shall be no less than the minimum number of acres required. A
mutually appointed appraiser will determine parkland fair market value. The
developer shall pay any expenses accrued in the determination of the payment
amount.
8.   General Regulations.
   A.   The determination of what land shall be dedicated shall be based on the
following:
      (1)   The City’s Comprehensive Plan and/or a Park or Trail Master Plan.
      (2)   Area master plans.
      (3)   The topography and geology of the land within the subdivision.
      (4)   The location of existing and proposed parks, trails and greenways.
      (5)   The size and shape of the property and the land available for
dedication.
      (6)   The presence of undeveloped lands adjacent to the development
boundary where a dedication may be favorable so as to allow the public parkland
to be increased in size when the adjacent property develops.
   B.   At the time of filing a preliminary plat or site plan, the developer of
the property shall, as part of that filing, indicate whether he or she desires
to dedicate parkland or pay a fee in lieu thereof. If the developer desires to
dedicate parkland, said person shall designate the area on the preliminary plat
or site plan. The proposed parkland dedication will be reviewed as part of the
preliminary plat or site plan review process. Dedication of land or payment of
a fee in lieu shall be completed prior to development recording or issuance of
building permits.
   C.   The developer shall designate on the plat map or site plan the proposed
number of dwelling units by type. Designation shall be for park dedication
calculation purposes only and such designation shall not constitute approval of
the design or location of units. If a number is not designated on the plat or
site plan, the total number of dwelling units shall be the maximum number of
such units permitted by the exiting zoning district. If the developer wishes to
change the density, a new plat map or site plan shall be submitted detailing
the changes. If the density is increased, the additional dedication amount
shall be calculated and will be due before changes can be approved. Should the
density be lowered, arrangements will be made to return dedicated property, at
the developer’s expense, provided that it has not yet been developed as park
space.
   D.   Land conveyed to the City for park purposes shall be conveyed by
warranty deed, free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances, including
judgments, attachments, mechanics, and other liens.
   E.   The developer shall be required to prepare the parkland prior to
dedication in a manner acceptable to the City. This includes:
      (1)   The site shall be located adjacent to an improved street with
sidewalks and utilities as required by the City. The site shall have access to
such a fully improved street across at least ten (10) percent of the distance
of its perimeter. Any access route shall be at least thirty (30) feet wide for
trails and fifty (50) feet for roadway access.
      (2)   On-site drainage patterns shall be designed and constructed by the
developer with the approval of the City.
      (3)   Grading shall comply with approved plans.
      (4)   Top soil shall be spread evenly and lightly compacted to an
adequate depth for turf growth.
      (5)   Seeding shall occur during the fall or spring in accordance with
standard specifications of the City. A maintainable stand of grass shall be
established prior to acceptancy by the City.
