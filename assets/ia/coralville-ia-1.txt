The City Attorney may draft and mail to the parties written questionnaire or
document requests to which respondent and complainant are required to respond.

thirty (30) days of the receipt of the questionnaire/document request unless an
extension has been granted by the County Attorney.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â After reviewing materials responsive to the questionnaire/document
request, the City Attorney shall determine whether the complaint warrants
further investigation. If the City Attorney finds there is a reasonable
possibility of a probable cause determination or the legal issues present in
the complaint need further development, the County Attorney shall promptly
resume the investigation of the complaint. If the County Attorney determines
that the complaint does not warrant further investigation, it shall be
administratively closed. Notice of such closure shall be promptly served upon
the complainant and the respondent by certified mail. Service is effective upon

promptly review the complainantâs request and all relevant material. If, after
review by the City Attorney, it is determined that the complaint does not
warrant further processing, the City Attorney shall close the file and notify
the complainant and respondent of the final decision of administrative closure.

possibility of a probable cause determination or the legal issues presented in
the complaint need further development, the allegations will be investigated
further.

written opinion as to whether probable cause exists to believe a discriminatory
practice occurred as alleged by the complainant.

of the complaint through a predetermination settlement.
7.Â Â Â Closure.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A complaint may be administratively closed at any time if the
complainant cannot be contacted after diligent efforts or is uncooperative
causing unreasonable delay in the processing of a complaint.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A complaint may be closed as satisfactorily resolved when the
respondent has made an offer of settlement acceptable to the City Attorney but
not the complainant. Notice of intended closure shall state the reasons for
closure and be served by certified mail upon the complainant. The complainant
shall be allowed thirty (30) days to respond in writing to the City Attorney
either stating the reasons why the offer is unacceptable or accepting the
offer. The City Attorney will review and consider the response before making a

2.Â Â Â Remedial Action Ordered by City Attorney. In addition to the remedies in
the preceding provisions of this section, the City Attorney may issue an order
requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the discriminatory or unfair
practice and to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the City
Attorney will carry out the purposes of this chapter as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In the case of a respondent operating by virtue of a license issued by
the State or a political subdivision or agency, if the City Attorney, upon
notice to the respondent with an opportunity to be heard, determines that the
respondent has engaged in a discriminatory or unfair practice and that the
practice was authorized, requested, commanded, performed or knowingly or
recklessly tolerated by the Board of Directors of the respondent or by an
officer or executive agent acting within the scope of their employment, the
City Attorney shall so certify to the licensing agency. Unless the practice is
reversed in the course of judicial review, the finding of discrimination is
binding on the licensing agency. If a certification is made pursuant to this
subsection, the licensing agency may initiate licensee disciplinary procedures.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In the case of a respondent who is found by the City Attorney to have
engaged in a discriminatory or unfair practice in the course of performing
under a contract or subcontract with the State or political subdivision or
agency, if the practice was authorized, requested, commanded, performed or
knowingly or recklessly tolerated by the board or executive agent acting within
the scope of their employment, the City Attorney shall so certify to the
contracting agency. Unless the City Attorneyâs finding of a discriminatory or
unfair practice is reversed in the course of judicial review, the finding of
discrimination is binding on the contracting agency.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Upon receiving a certification made under this subsection, a
contracting agency may take appropriate action to terminate a contract or
portion thereof previously entered into with the respondent, either absolutely
or on condition that the respondent carry out a program of compliance with the
provisions of this title, and assist the state and all political subdivisions
and agencies thereof to refrain from entering into further contracts.
3.Â Â Â Multiple Remedies Available. The election of an affirmative order under
subsection 2 of this section shall not bar the election of affirmative remedies
provided in subsection 1 of this section.
4.Â Â Â Civil Penalties. In connection with housing discrimination complaints, the
County Attorney may, to vindicate the public interest, assess a civil penalty
against the respondent in an amount not to exceed those established by Code of
Iowa Chapter 216.15A, as amended. Funds collected under this section shall be
paid to the City for deposit to the City treasury to the credit of the General
Fund.
5.Â Â Â Other Remedies. Any other relief that the administrative law judge finds
to be appropriate.
26.12 NOTICE AND HEARING.
1.Â Â Â Litigation Worthy. If conciliation has been bypassed or unsuccessful, the

worthy. If the County Attorney determines the case not to be litigation worthy,
the case will be administratively closed.
2.Â Â Â Pre-Hearing Proceedings.

Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Although the rules of evidence do not apply in a contested case
hearing, a finding shall be based upon the kind of evidence on which reasonably
prudent persons are accustomed to rely for the conduct of their serious

upon, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Was discussed in the proposed decision, but not argued on brief by
the parties.
10.Â Â Â Awards of Attorney Fees.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In any final decision in which it is determined that the complainant is
entitled to an award of attorney fees, but the actual amount has not yet been
determined, there is, by operation of this provision, an express retention of
jurisdiction of the case by the City Attorney in order to determine the actual
amount of attorney fees to which the party is entitled and to enter a
subsequent order awarding those fees, regardless of whether or not such
retention of jurisdiction is expressed in the final decision. In such case, the
decision is final in all other respects except the determination of the amount
of the attorney fees.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the amount of attorney fees is not stipulated to by the parties, the

will be served.

proceeding may waive any provision of this chapter. However, the administrative
law judge, in the discretion of the presiding officer, may refuse to give

be inconsistent with the public interest.

respondent shall pay the âcontested case costsâ incurred by the City. If the
respondent prevails in the hearing, the City shall itself bear the âcontested
case costsâ incurred by the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Mixed Results. Where the complainant is successful as to part of the
remedies sought at the hearing and unsuccessful as to part of the remedies, the
administrative law judge may recommend an equitable apportionment of âcontested
case costsâ between the City and the respondent.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this Article, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this Article, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning:
1.Â Â Â Biased Policing means differential treatment in the performance of law
enforcement duties or delivery of police services towards a person or classes
of persons when one or more individual demographics was a motivating factor in
the action taken. If a person's individual demographics played a motivating
factor in the city employee's decision, then that personal characteristic was a
motivating factor of the action taken.
2.Â Â Â Fair and Impartial Treatment means persons, irrespective of individual
demographics, are treated in the same manner under the same or similar
circumstances. Reasonable concessions and accommodations may be made, when
dealing with individuals with physical, developmental or mental disabilities,
injury, illness, deafness, blindness, substance abuse disorders or similar
conditions, individuals whose primary language is a language other than
English, individuals of various cultural backgrounds, and individuals of
youthful age, or when information about a person legally necessitates different
treatment.
3.Â Â Â Individual Demographics means personal characteristics to include, but not
limited to: race, creed, color, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, religion,
age, gender, sex, gender identity/ expression, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, disability, immigration status, familial status, housing
status, occupation, language fluency, cultural group, political status, or
source of income, or any other identifiable characteristics.
4.Â Â Â Law Enforcement Officer means an officer appointed by the director of the
department of natural resources; an officer appointed by the director of the
Iowa law enforcement academy and sworn in for the purposes of training; a
member of a police force or other agency or department of the state, county or
city regularly employed as such and who is responsible for the prevention and
detection of crime and the enforcement of the criminal laws of this state.
5.Â Â Â Police Services means actions and activities that contribute to the
overall well-being and safety of the public. These tasks include but are not
limited to: crime prevention and investigation, preventive patrol, traffic
control, traffic accidents, medical emergencies and lifesaving services,
assistance at fire scenes, public information and education.
6.Â Â Â Racial Profiling means that form of biased policing where a motivating
factor of the action taken is based on an individual's race, color, ethnicity,
religion or national origin rather than on the individual's behavior or on
information of the type and kind customarily and reasonably relied upon in
identifying the individual as having engaged in prohibited activity. Racial
profiling includes but is not limited to vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle stops
where race, color, ethnicity, religion or national origin was a motivating
factor for the stop or enforcement action taken during the stop.
7.Â Â Â Specific subject description-based identification means a reasonably
detailed physical description of the personal identifying characteristics of a
potential suspect or victim, including but not limited to age, sex, ethnicity,
race, or English language proficiency.

identification.

demographic, except when necessary to include such terms, language or remarks
used by another for the preparation of official reports or testimony.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Employees must be able to articulate reasonable suspicion or probable
cause supporting any police action.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Employees shall not take any law-enforcement action based on

Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,

waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within thirty (30) days, the City Attorney shall

property by others.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 716.7 [2c])
4.Â Â Â Using Property Without Permission. Being upon or in property and
wrongfully using, removing therefrom, altering, damaging, harassing, or placing
thereon or therein anything animate or inanimate, without the implied or actual
permission of the owner, lessee, or person in lawful possession.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 716.7 [2d])
None of the above shall be construed to prohibit entering upon the property of
another for the sole purpose of retrieving personal property which has

property of another, provided that the person retrieving the property takes the
most direct and accessible route to and from the property to be retrieved,

damage, deface, alter, or destroy property.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 716.1)

order of any court, during the time for which the same is to remain set up.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 716.1)
42.04 UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY.
No unauthorized person shall enter or remain in or upon any public building,
premises or grounds in violation of any notice posted thereon or when said
building, premises or grounds are closed and not open to the public. When open

unauthorized entry.
42.05 FRAUD.

Section 714.8 of the Code of Iowa.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 714.8)

It is unlawful for any person to commit theft. A person commits theft when the
person does any of the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 714.1)
1.Â Â Â Takes possession or control of the property of another or property in the
possession of another, with the intent to deprive the other thereof.
2.Â Â Â Misappropriates property which the person has in trust or property of
another which the person has in the personâs possession or control whether such
possession or control is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it in a
manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the trust or of the ownerâs
rights in such property, or conceals found property or appropriates such
property to the personâs own use, when the owner of such property is known to
the person. Failure by a bailee or lessee of personal property to return the
property within seventy-two (72) hours after a time specified in a written
agreement of lease or bailment shall be evidence of misappropriation.
3.Â Â Â Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer of possession,
control, or ownership of the property of another, or the beneficial use of
property of another, by deception. Where compensation for goods and services is
ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or the rendering
of such services, the refusal to pay or leaving the premises without payment or
offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner or operator the right to
pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an inference that the
goods or services were obtained by deception.
4.Â Â Â Exercises control over stolen property, knowing such property to have been
stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property has been
stolen, unless the personâs purpose is to promptly restore it to the owner or
to deliver it to an appropriate public officer. The fact that the person is
found in possession of property which has been stolen from two (2) or more
persons on separate occasions, or that the person is a dealer or other person
familiar with the value of such property and had acquired it for a
consideration which is far below its reasonable value, shall be evidence from
which the court or jury may infer that the person knew or believed that the
property had been stolen.
5.Â Â Â Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which someone else
has a security interest with intent to defraud the secured party.
6.Â Â Â Makes, utters, draws, delivers, or gives any check, share draft, draft, or
written order on any bank, credit union, person or corporation, and obtains
property or service in exchange therefor, if the person knows that such check,
share draft, draft or written order will not be paid when presented. Whenever
the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because of insufficient
funds, and the maker has not paid the holder of the instrument the amount due
thereon within ten (10) days of the makerâs receipt of notice from the holder
that payment has been refused by the drawee, the court or jury may infer from
such facts that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on
presentation. Notice of refusal of payment shall be by certified mail, or by
personal service in the manner prescribed for serving original notices.
Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because the maker
has no account with the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such fact that
the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on presentation.
7.Â Â Â Obtains gas, electricity or water from a public utility or obtains cable
television or telephone service from an unauthorized connection to the supply
or service line or by intentionally altering, adjusting, removing or tampering
with the metering or service device so as to cause inaccurate readings.

Â 
46.01 CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â âEmergency errandâ means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury or loss of
life.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â âKnowinglyâ means knowledge which a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâs custody. This is an objective standard. It shall, therefore, be no
defense that an adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the

person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing
nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile

other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but not for
longer than six (6) hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.

streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which
are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.

specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minorâs place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in

public place.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driverâs license,
a peace officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his or her best
judgment in determining age.

the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the personâs
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any non-secured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a peace officer determines that a
minor does not have adult supervision because the peace officer cannot locate
the minorâs parent, guardian or other person legally responsible for the care
of the minor, within a reasonable time, the peace officer shall attempt to
place the minor with an adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares
for the child or another adult person who is known to the child.
6.Â Â Â Notice. Notice of the ordinance codified in this section and its contents

impounding of said animal. Within five (5) days following notice of such
impoundment, the City Administrator shall schedule a public hearing thereon,

stating that the release of said animal shall be permitted only upon written
authorization of the City Administrator or the Police Chief or their designee.
4.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be to determine (a) whether or not the animal is
vicious, (b) whether or not the owner has failed to restrain such animal
reasonably, and (c) whether or not it is in the public best interest to destroy
said animal. The public hearing shall be conducted before the City
Administrator pursuant to rules of procedure promulgated therefor.
5.Â Â Â If, pursuant to subsection 4 above, a determination is made that the
animal is a vicious animal and that the owner has failed to restrain such
animal reasonably and that it is in the public best interest to destroy said
animal, then said animal shall be destroyed in a humane manner after five (5)
full days have elapsed following the City Administratorâs determination, which
shall occur at the close of the public hearing. The owner may appeal said
determination first to the City Council and after public hearing and decision
thereby within five (5) full days appealed to a court of competent

is at least eight to ten feet wide. See Pedestrian Safety Islands | National
Association of City Transportation Officials (nacto.org).
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â That the City Engineer has determined based upon GIS maps and/or where
appropriate, site visits that the intersections listed in section 2 of this do
not have medians of islands of adequate width for pedestrian refuge, therefore,
pedestrians should be prohibited from standing, sitting or staying in the
medians at these intersections for any other purpose other than to cross the
road.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â That because the aprons of the roundabouts in the city streets are
designed to be driven across by vehicle, no pedestrians shall stand, sit or
stay on the aprons or splitter islands of any roundabouts in the City as listed
in section 3.
2.Â Â Â For streets with a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or higher, pedestrians
are prohibited from standing, sitting or staying on a median for any other
purpose other than to cross the street unless the median is paved and the width
of the top surface of the median is at least ten feet wide. This prohibits
pedestrians from standing, sitting or staying on a median at the following
intersections of the city:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â 1 st Avenue and 2 nd Street

take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and may take into
custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority may
employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private entity,
equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving, storing, or
disposing of abandoned vehicles. A property owner or other person in control of
private property may employ a private entity which is a garage keeper to
dispose of an abandoned vehicle, and the private entity may take into custody
the abandoned vehicle without a police authorityâs initiative. If a police
authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles, the police

placing the vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The
notice shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants
to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authorityâs initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity
may claim a garage keeperâs lien as described in Section 321.90 of the Code of
Iowa, and may proceed to sell or dispose of the vehicle. If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a police authority or by a private entity

rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the
planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police authority or
private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this

or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,
title, claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders or claimants after the
expiration of the ten-day reclaiming period.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.04 NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.
If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.

abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose
title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the expense
of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification required, in

vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety (90) days, and then shall be
deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09 DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor vehicle
for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or otherwise demolish such motor

90.01 DEFINITIONS.
The following terms are defined for use in the chapters of this Code of
Ordinances relating to the water service system:
1.Â Â Â âCustomerâ means anyone using water furnished by the City, including other
departments, funds, boards and commissions of the City.
2.Â Â Â âService pipeâ means the pipe laid beyond the water main toward the
premises to be served with water. The service pipe includes all pipes and
valves between the water main and the water meter.
3.Â Â Â âWater Departmentâ means the City, acting through its qualified officers.
4.Â Â Â âWater mainâ means any pipe laid by the Water Department or an agent
thereof, or accepted by the Water Department, which is a portion of a water
distribution system of the City.
90.02 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
Applications for water service shall be presented to the Building Official
together with the request for a building permit. Said building permit shall
include a statement indicating the size of the water service tap as well as the
water service size that is required, including the approximate location where
the service will enter the premises. The building permit application will
include the cost for water service material, tap and meter.
90.03 TAPS TO WATER MAINS.
All taps to water mains shall be made by the Water Department. The Water
Department shall charge a uniform fee for the making of all taps, such fee to
be based on labor, material and overhead expense. The size of each tap shall be
approved by the Water Department. A suitable area around the main, properly
protected with cribbing when necessary, shall be provided by the owner.
90.04 SERVICE PIPES.
1.Â Â Â Installation of Services. All service pipes and fixtures from the street
water main to the premises, including the corporation cock, shall be installed
at the expense of the owner. All one-inch to two-inch service pipes shall be
copper pipe from the corporation cock to the stop box and from the stop box to
the building shall be of materials as specified by the Water Department. A
service may not cross another property line to supply water for the applicant.
2.Â Â Â Size of Service.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Residential â one-inch minimum size from the main to street side of the
meter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Commercial â one-inch minimum from the main to the street side of the
meter or as determined by the Water Department.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Multi-Family and Industrial â as determined by the Water Department.
All pipes requiring a service larger than two (2) inches shall be made with a
tapping sleeve and cast iron gate valve of a minimum of four (4) inches in size
and a roadway valve box of a design approved by the Water Department.
3.Â Â Â Service Shutoff. The stop box and curb valve shall be of a design approved
and supplied by the Water Department at a uniform charge. A stop box on every
service shall be kept flush with the surrounding ground in a location approved
by the Water Department. The stop box and curb valve will not be installed
underneath or in a sidewalk. The water is to be turned on at the stop box only
by authorized Water Department personnel. It is unlawful for any person to
block or hinder access to the stop box.
4.Â Â Â Extension of Service Pipes. After a service connection has been laid, no
plumber or other person shall make any attachment or connection thereto so as
to serve any premises or buildings other than set forth in the original
application for service.
5.Â Â Â Maintenance. All service pipes and fixtures from the street water main to
the premises, including the corporation cocks and threading at the mains, shall
be the responsibility of and maintained at the expense of the owners. Any leak
or other defect in the service shall be promptly repaired by the owner, and if
not repaired promptly, the water shall be turned off until such repairs have
been made. In any case where the Water Department informs a property owner that
there is a leak in said ownerâs service and the plumber finds that the leak is
actually in the main, the Water Department will reimburse the property owner
for any actual expense and will assume responsibility for the repairs.
90.05 NONCONFORMING SERVICE LINES AND CONNECTIONS.
Service lines presently in use and made of materials other than cast iron,
copper or approved plastic shall be replaced by copper, cast iron or approved
plastic pipes at the expense of the owner when, in the opinion of the Water
Department, such lines have become so disintegrated as to be unfit for further
use or if the lines contain hazardous material (i.e. lead). Owners of premises
having water services which do not have separate stop cocks and boxes for each
building or separately owned unit, or which do not otherwise conform to the
requirements of this chapter shall be required to put in such stop cocks or
make such other changes as are necessary to conform with the requirements of
this chapter when instructed to do so by the Water Department. In the event
only one unit owner on a joint water service line attempts to have separate
stop cocks and boxes, and the remaining joint users refuse to share equitably
in the total cost thereof, then upon receipt of a qualified, written, itemized,
signed appraisal showing a total cost in excess of $1,500.00, the Water
Department with City Administrator approval may accept in escrow 110% of the
pro rata userâs share of the total cost. Said escrow amount shall release that
userâs unit from the lien or cloud of nonconformance herewith. Additionally,
said escrow amount shall be non-interest-bearing and held by the City for
eventual contribution to the total cost of bringing all of the involved joint
users into compliance herewith. The Water Department does not waive its right
to a total joint line service âshut offâ wherein an individual joint user has
become delinquent in service payment.
90.06 ABANDONED SERVICE PIPES.
All service pipes that may become useless because water will no longer be used
through them shall be permanently closed off at the water main at the expense
of the owner of the premises. If the service is to be replaced because of
inadequacy or for other reasons, the old service shall be shut off at the main
and the old pipe cut off at the corporation cock by the Water Department. No
plumber or property owner shall disconnect or remove water supply fixtures or
piping from any premises served by the Water Department or alter the same in
any way so as to make the service connection unnecessary for the premises
without having the Water Department permanently close off the connection at the
main. If a service pipe or connection, not currently in use, is found to be
leaking, the Water Department may, without notice, turn off the same and charge
the expense thereof to the owner of the property.
90.07 SUPPLY OF OTHER THAN CITY WATER.
On premises where water is supplied from two (2) sources, City water being one
of them, the piping system for the City water shall be entirely separate from
that of the other source, unless such other supply is approved for public use
by the Board of Health and is maintained in such approved condition. If other
than City water is to be furnished to premises previously supplied by City
water, the owner or plumber doing the work shall give notice thereof at the
office of the Water Department when such change is to be made, and provisions
shall also be made for cutting off the City water supply at the corporation
cock and disconnecting the service pipe. When the owner of the premises or an
authorized agent has a direct connection between the City water supply and
another supply which has not been approved, said owner or agent shall forthwith
disconnect the same. The owners of any houses, buildings or properties used for
human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, situated within the
City and abutting any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now
located a public water main, are prohibited from drilling any type of well for
the provision of supplying potable water to the property.
90.08 INSPECTION OF METERS, PIPES AND FIXTURES.
Any officer or employee of the Water Department or any authorized City
inspector shall be permitted at all reasonable hours to enter the premises or
buildings of customers for the purpose of reading meters and inspecting the
water pipes and fixtures. The Water Department reserves the right to set or
remove a meter whenever it is deemed advisable to do so. Refusal on the part of
the owner, customer or occupant of any premises served by City water, within
three business days of request by the Water Department, to permit an officer or
employee of the Water Department to enter such premises shall be sufficient
cause for discontinuance of water service to such premises.
90.09 OPENING HYDRANTS.
No person, except authorized City employees acting in the performance of their
duties, shall open any hydrant belonging to the Water Department at any time
without a written permit issued by the Water Department.
90.10 EXPANSION OF WATER MAINS; SIZE OF MAINS.
The size of the main required to serve any part of the City shall be determined
by the Water Department, and all plans and specifications of proposed
expansions or extensions of water mains shall be approved by the Water
Department. The Water Department shall inspect such expansions or extensions
and a fee in the amount of the hourly rate plus one hundred percent (100%)
shall be charged for such inspection.
90.11 WATER MAINS â PAYMENT OF COSTS.
When water mains are extended, the property owners benefited thereby, as
determined by the Water Department, shall be charged a uniform fee based on the
cost of extending a main eight (8) inches in diameter, together with all
necessary valves, fire hydrants and other parts.
90.12 EXTENSION OF MAINS TO PROPERTY LINES.
All water main extensions shall be made to the farthest point on the ownerâs
property line in order to allow for any future expansion. Said extension shall
be ended or terminated with a fire hydrant and valve.
90.13 EXTENSION OF MAINS ON PERIMETER STREETS.
Extensions of water mains along streets lying partly inside and partly outside
the City limits may be made on the basis of special assessments against
abutting property owners. The City may pay the assessment on land lying outside
the City limits and, if so paid, the City may make provision for collecting
such payments from the abutting property owners at such time as such land may
be annexed.
90.14 CONNECTING LOOPS.
Before any abutting property shall connect to the mains constructed at the
expense of the Water Department, a charge based on the front footage of the
property to be served shall be collected by the City on the basis of the costs
of the six (6) inch main. Connecting loops and cross ties within a subdivision
shall be constructed by the subdivider. If the connecting loop is such that the
property outside the subdivision abuts such loop or ties and connections are
made to such a line, the reimbursement provisions of this chapter shall apply.
90.15 EXTENSION OF MAINS OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS.
No main shall be extended outside the City limits, except to serve property
within the City limits or under contract with the City.
90.16 SUBDIVISIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS.
When it is requested or necessary to bring water service from the existing
water system through private or vacant property, or to construct lines to the
perimeter of such property, the subdivider, developer or individual shall pay
the entire cost of the construction and shall furnish all necessary easements
or rights-of-way. This section does not preclude the City from extending water
lines by special assessment process if so determined.
90.17 CONTROL BY THE CITY.
The City reserves the right to shut off the water in its mains or in a service
line at any time when necessary for the purpose of making repairs or extensions
or for other reasons, and the City shall have the sole authority to restore
such service.
90.18 LIABILITY â RESPONSIBILITY IN TURNING ON WATER.
The City shall not be responsible or liable for any damage done to the property
of the user or owner by reason of the water service supply being shut off for
any reason, provided notice is sent to the user or owner of such property,
regardless of actual receipt thereof. In turning on water or restoring service,
the City shall not be responsible for any damage that may occur by reason of
improper fixtures, open or improper connections or for any other cause.
90.19 INSTALLATION OF IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT.
Before the installation of any equipment that is to be used for irrigation
purposes within the Cityâs right-of-way, the Contractor shall obtain a permit
from the Building Official and pay the appropriate fee for excavating in the
right-of-way. The City may remove, or cause to be removed, said irrigation
equipment that is located in the Cityâs right-of-way for any lawful purpose if
the City Engineer determines that the equipment is interfering with the
implementation of said lawful purpose. If said equipment is removed for any
lawful purpose, the City is under no obligation to replace said equipment.
90.20 INTERFERENCE WITH WATER MAIN OR SERVICE PIPES.
When the City has determined that any animate or inanimate object has
interfered with the normal operation of a water main or service pipe, said
object is deemed a nuisance, and the City shall abate said nuisance in

inspector of the Water Department. A valve shall also be placed on the pipe on
the outlet side of each meter not more than three (3) feet from the meter. All
valves and fittings necessary to comply with this chapter to provide a
connection to the meter, except the coupling or flange at each end of the
meter, shall be provided by the owner of the premises served.
3.Â Â Â Size. The Water Department reserves the right to install the size meter
that investigation shows to be sufficient to supply the quantity of water
required by the premises. For premises requiring a two (2) inch meter or
larger, the Water Department may install two (2) or more meters of a smaller
size. Where meters are so placed, each meter shall have a valve or shutoff on
both the inlet and outlet pipe, in addition to the basement shutoff. Where a
service pipe of two (2) inches or larger is used, the plumber shall contact the
Water Department for instructions regarding the fittings and space to be

Â 
4.Â Â Â More Than One Meter in Building. In case two (2) or more meters are
designed to measure water to different tenants in the same building from one
service connection, they shall be placed so that no one of them will measure
water which has passed through the other one.
5.Â Â Â New Buildings. If the meter is to be installed in a new building or
structure, the applicant shall furnish the Water Department proof that the
plumbing has been approved by the Plumbing Inspector, that all charges for
water previously furnished such applicant and all other charges due for
services furnished thereto have been paid and that a suitable place is provided
for the meter. The unmetered use of water during the construction of new
buildings shall be permitted; provided, however, that such use is reasonable;
and further provided that the watering of seed, sod, shrubbery, trees and all
other landscaping plantings and materials is expressly prohibited before the
proper installation of a water meter. The meter will be set and the water
turned on to the stop inside the house where the owner or occupant may turn the
water on into the piping system and fixtures of the premises. Payment for the
meter as per the above schedule shall be made at the time the building permit
is issued.
6.Â Â Â Access to Water Meters Located in Secure Locations. In the event that the
water meter(s) are located at a secure location within the building, the owner,
occupant or customer shall, within three (3) business days of written notice to
said owner, occupant, or customer, permit an officer or employee of the Water
Department to access the water meters for any lawful purpose.
91.02 METERING MULTI-FAMILY UNITS.
All buildings or multi-family units containing two (2) or more units shall be
furnished with one (1) meter of a size determined by the Water Department. The
meter readings shall be billed to the owner at the current commercial rate on a
commercial schedule. At the ownerâs request, meters may be purchased for each
unit, and the owners of the buildings shall be billed for the individual meter
readings on the current residential rate. The owner shall be charged for any
meters in excess of the one provided by the City. The owner may use additional
meters for private owner monitoring, which shall be purchased through the Water
Department. Meters under either provision set out in this section shall be
listed under the ownerâs name and be billed to the owner.
91.03 OWNERS TO PROTECT METERS.
1.Â Â Â The owner of the premises where a meter is installed shall be held
responsible for its care and protection from freezing or hot water and from
injury or interference from any person. In case of damage to the meter, or in
case of its stoppage or imperfect working, the owner of the premises shall give
immediate notice to the office of the Water Department. In all cases where
meters are broken or damaged by negligence of an owner or occupant of the
premises, or by freezing, hot water or other injuries, except ordinary wear,
the necessary repairs to the meter shall be made by the Water Department and
the cost thereof shall be paid by the owner. In case payment thereof is
neglected or abused, the Water Department shall turn off the water and shall
not turn it on until full payment, together with all service charges, has been
made. Damaged meters may be repaired by the Water Department without first
giving notice thereof to the owners of the premises served by such meters.
2.Â Â Â No one shall in any way interfere with the proper registration of water
meters and no one except an authorized employee of the Water Department shall
break a seal on a meter. The City may assess the property owner or tenant a
treble charge for the estimated or metered water wrongfully obtained when
tampering has been determined by the City to have taken place.
3.Â Â Â Whenever a water meter is installed on a water service in premises that
are to be remodeled, removed or destroyed, or where the service is to be
discontinued so that the water meter is no longer needed, the owner of such
premises shall give notice to the Water Department in writing to remove such
meter, and free access thereto shall be provided. The owner of the premises or
an authorized agent shall be responsible for the meter until such written
notice is given and the meter is recovered. If the meter is damaged, buried or
lost, the owner of the premises or the authorized agent shall be required to
pay for the same at cost less depreciation.
91.04 TESTING METERS.
In case there is any doubt on the part of the customer as to the accuracy of
any water meter, the customer may have the meter tested by the Water
Department, at which the customer may be present or have a representative
present if desired. If the meter is found to register within two percent (2%)
of being correct, a charge will be made to pay for the labor in making such a
test and all related service charges. If the meter is found to measure more
than two percent (2%) fast, no charge will be made therefor, and there shall be

94.03 WATER SYSTEM UTILITY CONNECTION FEE.
A connection fee is hereby imposed for each connection made to the Municipal
Water System Utility within the boundaries of the West Coralville Water System
Connection Fee District described herein. The proposed improvements are known
as the âWest Coralville Water System Extension Projectâ (hereinafter referred
to as the âProject Improvementsâ) and consist generally of the construction of
water storage and oversizing water distribution improvements from 12-inch to
18-inch in diameter to serve approximately 1,620 acres within the District. The
Project Improvements are expected to be constructed in stages as development
occurs within the District. The Plan contains a description of the Project
Improvements and an Infrastructure Map illustrating the proposed locations of
the 18-inch diameter water main extensions to be constructed. The Plan also
contains an Infrastructure Cost Estimate for the proposed Project Improvements
(the âInfrastructure Cost Estimateâ) and an allocation of the same on a per-
acre basis. As of January 1, 1998, the Project Improvements were expected to
serve 1,620 acres within the District, and construction costs were estimated to
be $1,250,000. As of said date, the estimated cost per acre for such
improvements was $775.00. The Infrastructure Cost Estimate will be reviewed
annually by an engineering firm selected by the City for said purpose and
adjusted, as of January 1 of each year from and after January 1, 1998, in
accordance with the Engineering News Record Cost Index or to reflect actual
construction costs, as applicable, for the appropriate period of time and
thereafter shall be presented to the Council for approval. After approval of
the same by the Council, a copy of the most recent Infrastructure Cost
Estimate, as so adjusted, and the resulting per-acre allocation, certified by
said engineering firm, shall be available for public inspection in the office
of the Clerk during normal business hours. Each such adjusted Infrastructure
Cost Estimate shall apply and become effective for purposes of this chapter
from and after the date of the approval by the Council of the ordinance
codified in this chapter. The connection fee payable by a property owner whose
property will be served by the Project Improvements will be calculated and
imposed on a per-acre basis, including a pro rata amount for any portion of an
acre included within the ownerâs subdivision plat or area to be so served and
shall be equal to (x) the most current per-acre Infrastructure Cost Estimate
for the Project Improvements approved by the Council and placed on file in the
office of the Clerk times (y) the number of acres (including any portions
thereof) included within the ownerâs subdivision plat or the area to be served
by connection to the Project Improvements. The connection fee will be payable
in full at the earlier of (i) the time of submission by the property owner to
the City of the subdivision plat for the area for signature and recording by
the City, in the form approved by the Council under Section 354.8 of the Code
of Iowa, or (ii) the time of submission by the property owner to the City
Engineer of construction plans for the construction of improvements on any
portion of the ownerâs property to be served by connection to the Project
Improvements. As of January 1, 1998, therefore, the connection fee payable is
$775.00 per acre of property included within the property ownerâs subdivision
plat or other development area until adjusted as described above. If the owner
of two contiguous parcels affected by this chapter desires to make a connection
to the Municipal Water System Utility that will serve only one such parcel, and
the parcels do not bear common improvements and have not been assembled into a
single unit for the purpose of use or development, the owner may make
application to the Council to connect to each such parcel separately. If the
Council finds that the parcels do not bear common improvements and have not
been assembled into a single unit for the purpose of use or development, the
original connection fee shall be calculated and paid only upon the parcel or
parcels that will be served by the connection. A separate connection fee shall
be paid when the parcel or parcels not served by the original connection to the
Municipal Water System Utility are connected.
94.04 PRIVATE SYSTEMS.
Property owners within the District are not mandated to connect to the Water
System Utility if they currently have a properly operating private water
system. If a property ownerâs private water system fails as determined by
guidelines previously established by the City Engineer, the property owner will
then be required to connect to the Municipal Water System Utility.
94.05 OTHER COSTS.
The connection fee imposed by this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other fees for connection required under the other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances. The property owner paying a connection fee will be
responsible for the full cost of providing any necessary water main extensions
or service lines from the private property improvements or buildings to the
public mains and extensions being constructed as part of the Project
Improvements.
94.06 NONPAYMENT.
In the event a connection is made to the Municipal Water System Utility without
payment of the connection fee set forth in this chapter, the City shall
disconnect such service until such time as the property owner has paid the
required connection fee. In addition, the City may pursue any other remedy
allowed by law.
94.07 USE OF PROCEEDS.
The connection fees collected by the City under this chapter shall be used only
for the purpose of operating the Municipal Water System Utility, or paying the
debt service on obligations issued to finance the Public Improvements.
94.08 INTERPRETATION.
The provisions of this chapter are intended and shall be construed so as to
fully implement the provisions of Section 384.38(3) of the Code of Iowa. In the
event that any provision of this chapter is determined to be contrary to law,
it shall not affect other provisions or application of this chapter which shall
at all times be construed to fully invoke the provisions of Section 384.38(3)
of the Code of Iowa with reference to the assessment and collection of the
connection fees provided thereunder.

public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent and Building Official may
have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
1.Â Â Â Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
2.Â Â Â Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
3.Â Â Â Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
4.Â Â Â Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06 OUTDOOR GREASE TRAP REQUIRED.
Prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit under the Cityâs Building Code,
all restaurants, as defined in
Chapter 165, shall be required to install and maintain an outside grease trap
in a manner that minimizes discharge into the Cityâs wastewater system. Upon
request of the Wastewater Superintendent, the owner of the restaurant shall
produce maintenance records to prove that the owner has been maintaining the
outside grease trap. In the event that the Wastewater Superintendent determines
that the grease trap is not being cleaned and maintained, or is discharging
amounts of grease into the wastewater system that could lead to damage to the
system or private property, the Wastewater Superintendent may, upon three daysâ
written notice, order that the outside grease trap be cleaned. In the event
that said grease trap is not cleaned within said three-day period, the
Wastewater Superintendent may have the outside grease trap cleaned and assess
the costs of the same back to the owner.
97.07 SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Building Official, City Engineer and State
Department of Natural Resources and subject to the requirements of all

equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the ownerâs expense.
97.08 CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Building
Official. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâs expense,
and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
97.09 TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâs
are determined from periodic grab samples). The frequency of sampling, testing
and analysis shall be determined by the Superintendent and the cost of
sampling, testing and analysis shall be an integral part of the pretreatment
cost of surcharge in the sewer service charges.

100.03 SANITARY SEWER UTILITY CONNECTION FEE.
A connection fee is hereby imposed for each connection made to the Municipal
Sanitary Sewer Utility within the boundary of the West Coralville Sanitary
Sewer Connection Fee District described herein. The proposed improvements are
known as the âWest Coralville Sanitary Sewer Extension Projectâ (hereinafter
referred to as the âProject Improvementsâ) and consist generally of the
construction of (i) certain off-site trunk sanitary sewers (referred to as the
Oakdale Trunk Sewers) to serve approximately 4,980 acres, including the
District and (ii) certain on-site trunk sanitary sewers of various diameters to
serve approximately 1,450 acres within the District. The Project Improvements
are expected to be constructed in stages as development occurs within the
District. The Plan contains a description of the Project Improvements and an
Infrastructure Map illustrating the proposed locations of the sanitary sewer
mains to be constructed. The Plan also contains an Infrastructure Cost Estimate
for the proposed Project Improvements (the âInfrastructure Cost Estimateâ) and
an allocation of the same on a per-acre basis. As of January 1, 1998, the
Oakdale Trunk Sewers being constructed as part of the Project Improvements were
expected to serve 4,980 acres, including the District, and construction costs
were estimated to be $890,000. As of said date, the estimated cost per acre for
such improvements was $180.00. As of January 1, 1998, the on-site trunk
sanitary sewers being constructed as part of the Project Improvements were
expected to serve 1,450 acres, and were estimated to cost $7,526,103. The
estimated cost per-acre as of said date for such improvements was $5,200 per
acre. The Infrastructure Cost Estimate will be reviewed annually by an
engineering firm selected by the City for said purpose and adjusted, as of
January 1 of each year from and after January 1, 1998, in accordance with the
Engineering News Record Cost Index or to reflect actual construction costs, as
applicable, for the appropriate period of time and thereafter shall be
presented to the City Council for approval. After approval of the same by the
Council, a copy of the most recent Infrastructure Cost Estimate, as so
adjusted, and the resulting per-acre allocation, certified by said engineering
firm, shall be available for public inspection of the office of the City Clerk
during normal business hours. Each such adjusted Infrastructure Cost Estimate
shall apply and become effective for purposes of this chapter from and after
the date of approval by the Council of the Ordinance codified in this chapter.
The connection fee payable by a property owner whose property will be served by
the Project Improvements will be calculated and imposed on a per-acre basis,
including a pro rata amount for any portion of an acre included within the
ownerâs subdivision plat or area to be so served and shall be equal to (x) the
most current per-acre Infrastructure Cost Estimate for the Project Improvements
approved by the Council and placed on file in the office of the Clerk times (y)
the number of acres including any portions thereof included within the ownerâs
subdivision plat or the area to be served by connection to the Project
Improvements. The connection fee will be payable in full at the earlier of (i)
the time of submission by the property owner to the City of the subdivision
plat for the area for signature and recording by the City, in the form approved
by the Council under Section 354.8 of the Code of Iowa, or (ii) the time of
submission by the property owner to the City Engineer of construction plans for
the construction of improvements on any portion of the ownerâs property to be
served by connection to the Project Improvements. As of January 1, 1998,
therefore, the connection fee payable is $5,380 per acre of property included
within the property ownerâs subdivision plat or other development area until
adjusted as described above. If the owner of two contiguous parcels affected by
this chapter desires to make a connection to the Municipal Sanitary Sewer
Utility that will serve only one such parcel, and the parcels do not bear
common improvements and have not been assembled into a single unit for the
purpose of use or development, the owner may make application to the Council to
connect to each such parcel separately. If the Council finds that the parcels
do not bear common improvements and have not been assembled into a single unit
for the purpose of use or development, the original connection fee shall be
calculated and paid only upon the parcel or parcels that will be served by the
connection. A separate connection fee shall be paid when the parcel or parcels
not served by the original connection to the Municipal Sanitary Sewer Utility
are connected.
100.04 PRIVATE SYSTEMS.
Property owners within the District are not mandated to connect to the
Municipal Sanitary Sewer Utility if they currently have a properly operating
private sewer system. If a property ownerâs private sewer system fails as
determined by guidelines previously established by the City Engineer, the
property owner will then be required to connect to the Municipal Sanitary Sewer
Utility.
100.05 OTHER COSTS.
The connection fee imposed by this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other fees for connection required under the other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances. The property owner paying a connection fee will be
responsible for the full cost of providing any necessary sanitary sewer
extensions or service lines from the private property improvements or buildings
to the trunk sewers being constructed as part of the Project Improvements.
100.06 NONPAYMENT.
In the event a connection is made to the Municipal Sanitary Sewer Utility
without payment of the connection fee set forth in this chapter, the City shall
disconnect such service until such time as the property owner has paid the
required connection fee. In addition, the City may pursue any other remedy
allowed by law.
100.07 USE OF PROCEEDS.
The connection fees collected by the City under this chapter shall be used only
for the purpose of operating the Municipal Sanitary Sewer Utility, or paying
the debt service on obligations issued to finance the Public Improvements.
100.08 INTERPRETATION.
The provisions of this chapter are intended and shall be construed so as to
fully implement the provisions of Section 384.38(3) of the Code of Iowa. In the
event that any provision of this chapter is determined to be contrary to law,
it shall not affect other provisions or application of this chapter, which
shall at all times be construed to fully invoke the provisions of Section
384.38(3) of the Code of Iowa with reference to the assessment and collection
of the connection fees provided thereunder.

101.03 STORM WATER AND RUNOFF MANAGEMENT CONNECTION FEE.
A connection fee is hereby imposed for each connection made to the municipal
storm water and runoff management improvements constructed within the boundary
of the West Coralville Storm Water and Runoff Management Connection Fee
District described herein. The proposed improvements are known as the âWest
Coralville Storm Water and Runoff Management Projectâ (hereinafter referred to
as the âProject Improvementsâ) and consists generally of the construction of
storm water and runoff management impoundments and structures expected to serve
approximately 1,330 acres within the District. The Project Improvements are
expected to be constructed in stages as development occurs within the District.
The Plan contains a description of the Project Improvements and an
Infrastructure Map illustrating the proposed locations of the storm water and
runoff management improvements to be constructed. The Plan also contains an
Infrastructure Cost Estimate for the proposed Project Improvements (the
âInfrastructure Cost Estimateâ) and an allocation of the same on a per-acre
basis. As of January 1, 1998, the Project Improvements were expected to serve
1,330 acres within the District, and construction costs were estimated to be
$3,368,000 (impoundments) and $4,340,000 (structures). As of said date, the
estimated cost per acre for such improvements was $3,210 (impoundments) and
$3,265 (structures), resulting in an aggregate cost estimate of $6,475 per
acre. The Infrastructure Cost Estimate will be reviewed annually by an
engineering firm selected by the City for said purpose and adjusted, as of
January 1 of each year from and after January 1, 1998, in accordance with the
Engineering News Record Cost Index or to reflect actual construction costs, as
applicable, for the appropriate period of time and thereafter shall be
presented to the Council for approval. After approval of the same by the
Council, a copy of the most recent Infrastructure Cost Estimate, as so
adjusted, and the resulting per-acre allocation, certified by said engineering
firm, shall be available for public inspection of the office of the Clerk
during normal business hours. Each such adjusted Infrastructure Cost Estimate
shall apply and become effective for purposes of this chapter from and after
the date of the approval by the City Council of the ordinance codified in this
chapter. The connection fee payable by a property owner whose property will be
served by the Project Improvements will be calculated and imposed on a per-acre
basis, including a pro rata amount for any portion of an acre included within
the ownerâs subdivision plat or area to be so served and shall be equal to (x)
the most current Infrastructure Cost Estimate for the Project Improvements
approved by the Council and placed on file in the office of the Clerk times (y)
the number of acres (including any portions thereof) included within the
ownerâs subdivision plat or the area to be served by connection to the Project
Improvements. The connection fee will be payable in full at the earlier of (i)
the time of submission by the property owner of the subdivision plat for the
area for signature and recording by the City, in the form approved by the
Council under Section 354.8 of the Code of Iowa, or (ii) the time of submission
by the property owner to the City Engineer of construction plans for the
construction of improvements on any portion of the ownerâs property to be
served by connection to the Project Improvements. As of January 1, 1998,
therefore, the connection fee payable is $6,475 per acre of property included
within the property owner's subdivision plat or other development area until
adjusted as described above. If the owner of two contiguous parcels affected by
this chapter desires to make a connection to the Project Improvements that will
serve only one such parcel, and the parcels do not bear common improvements and
have not been assembled into a single unit for the purpose of use or
development, the owner may make application to the Council to connect to each
such parcel separately. If the Council finds that the parcels do not bear
common improvements and have not been assembled into a single unit for the
purpose of use or development, the original connection fee shall be calculated
and paid only upon the parcel or parcels that will be served by the connection.
A separate connection fee shall be paid when the parcel or parcels not served
by the original connection to the Project Improvements are connected.
101.04 OTHER COSTS.
The connection fee imposed by this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other fees for connection required under the other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances. The property owner paying a connection fee will be
responsible for the full cost of providing any necessary storm water extensions
from the private property improvements or buildings to the impoundments and
structures being constructed as part of the Project Improvements.
101.05 NONPAYMENT.
In the event a connection is made to the Project Improvements without payment
of the connection fee set forth in this chapter, the City shall disconnect such
service until such time as the property owner has paid the required connection
fee. In addition, the City may pursue any other remedy allowed by law.
101.06 USE OF PROCEEDS.
The connection fees collected by the City under this chapter shall be used only
for the purpose of operating the Project Improvements, or paying the debt
service on obligations issued to finance the Public Improvements.
101.07 INTERPRETATION.
The provisions of this chapter are intended and shall be construed so as to
fully implement the provisions of Section 384.38(3) of the Code of Iowa. In the
event that any provision of this chapter is determined to be contrary to law,
it shall not affect other provisions or application of this chapter, which
shall at all times be construed to fully invoke the provisions of Section 384.3
8(3) of the Code of Iowa with reference to the assessment and collection of the
connection fees provided thereunder.

Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
2.Â Â Â Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to
continue.
103.07 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
1.Â Â Â Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The City
Engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
2.Â Â Â Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the City Engineer for
a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without
the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
103.08 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City
Engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
103.09 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
1.Â Â Â Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
2.Â Â Â Access to Facilities.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City Engineer shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures
in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Facility operators shall allow the City Engineer ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by State and Federal law.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The City Engineer shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facilityâs
storm water discharge.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The City Engineer has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facilityâs sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City Engineer and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Unreasonable delays in allowing the City Engineer access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â If the City Engineer has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
103.10 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY THE
USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
The City Engineer will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of
the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said personâs expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit.
103.11 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
personâs lessee or agent, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of
water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner, lessee or agent shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
103.12 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S.,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the City Engineer within three business days of
the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
103.13 ENFORCEMENT.
1.Â Â Â Notice of Violation. Whenever the City Engineer finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the
authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of

by cash or certified funds to avoid disconnection of services. An
administrative fee of $15.00 is added to the account for each dishonored check
or bank draft.
7.Â Â Â Deposits. Prior to the activation of a residential rental account, a
commercial or industrial account, the person responsible for the account shall
make a deposit in the amount as set by resolution of the Council, said amount
not to exceed the usual cost of 90 days of service for water service. After the
account is finalized, the amount of the final utility bill will be deducted
from the deposit amount, and the remainder of the deposit, if any, shall be
returned to the customer within 30 days.
8.Â Â Â Activation Fee. The responsible party on any new utility billing account
shall pay a nonrefundable activation fee in an amount of $30.00. This charge
shall be assessed and collected on the first utility bill issued to the new
utility billing account. This activation fee is not transferable to a different
location within the City.
107.05 SERVICE DISCONTINUED.
All of the services billed to the premises as a combined service account may be
discontinued after the following procedure has been followed:
1.Â Â Â Notice. The Utility Billing Clerk shall notify each delinquent customer
that service will be discontinued if payment of the combined service account,
including administrative fees, is not received by the date specified in the
notice of delinquency. Such notice shall be sent by ordinary mail to the
customer in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred and shall inform
the customer of the nature of the delinquency and afford the customer the
opportunity for a hearing prior to the discontinuance.
2.Â Â Â Notice to Landlords. If the customer is a tenant, and if the owner or
landlord of the property or premises has made a written request for notice, the
notice of delinquency shall also be given to the owner or landlord.
3.Â Â Â Hearing. If a hearing is requested by noon of the day preceding the shut
off, the City Clerk and the Water Superintendent shall conduct an informal
hearing and shall make a determination as to whether the disconnection is
justified. The customer has the right to appeal the staffâs decision to the
Council, and if the Council finds that disconnection is justified, then such
disconnection shall be made, unless payment of all charges and fees has been
received.
4.Â Â Â Fees. A fee of forty-five dollars ($45.00), plus the amount of the
delinquent bill, shall be charged before service is restored to a delinquent
customer during normal business hours and a fee of seventy-five dollars
($75.00), plus the amount of the delinquent bill, shall be charged to restore
service to a delinquent customer after business hours.
107.06 LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
The owner of the premises served and any tenant thereof shall be jointly and
severally liable for utility service charges to the premises. Utility service
charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien upon the
premises served, except as described in Section
107.07, and shall be certified by the Utility Billing Clerk to the County
Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.
107.07 LIEN EXEMPTION.
The lien for nonpayment shall not apply to a residential rental property where
water service is separately metered and the rates or charges for the water
service, sewer service, solid waste collection, and storm water drainage system
are paid directly by the tenant, if the landlord gives written notice to the
City that the property is residential rental property and that the tenant is
responsible for the rates or charges. The landlordâs written notice shall
contain the name of the tenant responsible for charges, the address of the
rental property and the date of occupancy. A change in tenant shall require a
new written notice to be given to the City within ten (10) business days of the
change in tenant. The lien exemption does not apply to delinquent charges for
repairs to a water service.
107.08 LIEN NOTICE.
A lien for delinquent utility service charges shall not be certified to the
County Treasurer unless prior written notice of intent to certify a lien is
given to the customer in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred. If
the customer is a tenant and if the owner or landlord of the property or
premises has made a written request for notice, the notice shall also be given
to the owner or landlord. The notice shall be sent to the appropriate persons
by ordinary mail not less than thirty (30) days prior to certification of the
lien to the County Treasurer. In the event a lien is certified to the County
Treasurer, a $5.00 administrative fee shall be added to the amount to be
certified to the Treasurer.
107.09 ACCOUNTS FOR RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY.
The owner of residential rental property shall, within ten days of a change in
tenancy, report the same of the new tenant to the Utility Billing Clerk or
direct the Utility Billing Clerk to place the utility billing account in the
ownerâs name. In the event that this does not occur, the Water Department shall
discontinue water service at the property.

3.Â Â Â If the terms and conditions specified in this Franchise conflict or modify
the Ordinance, the provisions of the Ordinance shall apply.
112.02 GRANTED TO FRANCHISEE.
1.Â Â Â Purpose. The purpose of this section is to award a Franchise for a Cable

112.03 RIGHT OF CITY TO ISSUE FRANCHISE.
Franchisee acknowledges and accepts the legal right of the City to issue this
Franchise .
112.04 TERM.
The term of the Franchise shall be for a period of ten (10) years from the
effective date, unless sooner terminated as provided in the Ordinance, at which
time it shall expire and be of no further force and effect.
112.05 FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE.
Consistent with the requirements of the Ordinance, this Franchise shall not be
construed as any limitation upon the right of the City to grant to other
persons rights, privileges, or authorities similar to the rights, privileges,
and authorities herein set forth, in the same or other streets, alleys, or
other public ways or public places. The City specifically reserves the right to
grant at any time during the term of this Franchise or renewal thereof, if any,
such additional Franchises for a Cable System as it deems appropriate. In the
event the Franchising Authority enters into a franchise with any other person
or entity other than the Franchisee to enter into the Cityâs streets and public
ways for the purpose of constructing or operating a Cable System to any part of
the service area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably
comparable to those contained herein, taking into account the size and
population of the franchised area, including but not limited to, franchise fee,
external costs, access fees, if applicable, design, term, density requirements
and system capacity requirements.
112.06 DEFINITIONS.
All definitions set forth in the Ordinance pertain to this Franchise and shall
be relevant to the purposes and meaning of this Franchise.
112.07 SERVICE AREA.
1.Â Â Â Service to all Residents. Franchisee shall offer cable television
residences service to all areas of the City which are in the corporate limits
of the City of Coralville and that meet the density requirements under
subsection 2 of this section, on the effective date of this Franchise. The
Franchisee shall provide cable service at the time of the upgrade pursuant to
Section
112.08 herein.
2.Â Â Â New Residential Construction. Franchisee shall extend service to all new
residences in all unwired developments within six months of a request of a
subscriber in an area to be served by underground construction and within three
months of a request of a subscriber for areas to be served aerially, whenever
density of at least twenty (20) residential dwelling units per cable plant
mile; as measured from the existing facilities of Franchiseeâs cable system in
the franchise area. For purposes of this section, density per cable mile shall
be computed by dividing the number of residential dwelling units in the area by
the length, in miles or fractions thereof, of the total length of aerial or
underground cable necessary to make service available to the residential
dwelling units in such area in accordance with Franchiseeâs system design
parameters. The cable length shall be measured from the nearest point on the
then-existing system. The total cable length shall exclude the drop cable
necessary to serve individual subscriber premises.
3.Â Â Â Contribution-in-aid. If an area does not meet the required number of
residential dwelling units per cable mile, Franchisee shall bear its pro-rata
share of the current construction costs based upon the actual number of
residential dwelling units per mile. For example, if there are 5 residential
dwelling units in a residentially zoned area, the Franchiseeâs share would be
5/20 or Â¼ of the construction cost. The remaining construction costs shall be
borne on a pro-rata basis by each cable television subscriber. After completion
of the project, should additional subscribers request and receive cable
television service, the pro-rata shares shall be recalculated. Any new
subscriber shall pay the new pro-rata share and all prior contributing
subscribers shall receive appropriate refunds. In any event, at the end of two
(2) years from the completion of residential construction in the area, the
subscribers shall no longer be eligible for refunds, and any amounts paid in
construction costs will be credited to the plant account of Franchisee.
4.Â Â Â Service Area. The service area of Franchisee shall be the entire corporate
boundaries of the City of Coralville and include any areas annexed to the City
in the future.
5.Â Â Â Commercial Service. Franchisee shall, upon request, make service available
to all commercial/industrial establishments served aerially which are located
within 125 feet of the system at Franchiseeâs standard installation rate
expense. For commercial/industrial establishments served underground or for
aerial extensions beyond 125 feet, Franchisee shall, upon request, make service
available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction,
including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of
determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be
borne by the Franchisee and the commercial/industrial establishments in the
area in which service may be expanded, the Franchisee will contribute an amount
equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction
whose numerator equals the actual number of commercial/industrial
establishments per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution
cable, and whose denominator equals eight (8) commercial/industrial
establishments. Commercial/industrial establishments who request service
hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro-
rata basis. The Franchisee may require that the payment of the capital
contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential commercial/
industrial establishments be paid in advance.
6.Â Â Â House Moving. Franchisee shall, upon the request of the City, move and
replace its facilities to accommodate house moves conducted on behalf of the
City, at a time and materials cost to the City. Wherever feasible, the City
shall use its best efforts to ensure that house moves follow the same or
similar path.
112.08 SYSTEM AND CAPACITY.
1.Â Â Â System. The parties understand and agree that Franchisee shall upgrade the
Cable System to a capacity capable of delivering a minimum of seventy-eight
(78) channels. After the upgrade is completed, the quality of Cable Service
will be materially comparable to the Iowa City Cable System. The system shall
be operated in accordance with performance standards which meet or exceed FCC
regulations.
2.Â Â Â Construction Timetable. The upgrade shall be completed within two (2)
years of the effective date of this Franchise. Two months prior to the
initiation of construction of the upgrade, Franchisee shall provide a
neighborhood construction schedule which details the timeframe for construction
in each neighborhood and area of the City.
3.Â Â Â Construction Oversight. Franchisee will inspect 100% of all fiber and
coaxial cable to insure that it meets the specifications of the Ordinance and
this Franchise. After the audit of subscriber drops as specified in Section 5
below, Franchisee will inspect 35% of the subscriber drops. The Franchisee
shall designate an employee to act as a company representative by responding to
public service complaints on a daily basis during the upgrade and provide the
City with the personâs name and telephone number.
4.Â Â Â Compliance with Applicable Law. In constructing, operating and maintaining
the system, Franchisee shall at all times comply with the Ordinance and all
applicable laws and regulations.
5.Â Â Â Drop Audit. Two years after the completion of the upgrade, Franchisee
shall have audited and tested ninety-five percent (95%) of the subscriber drops
in the City and all drops not meeting the standards of the National Electric
Code or the technical parameters in
Appendix A, attached hereto and incorporated by reference, shall be replaced
when found to be substandard. The system shall be designed to allow each

shall maintain its trap system until the introduction of the converters
described above and be available thereafter, as needed, for subscribers not
utilizing converters. The City Council may, in its discretion, extend the time
for the Franchisee, acting in good faith, to provide converters. The timeframe
for providing digital converters shall be extended for any period during which
the Franchisee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the Franchisee
is being subjected to delay due to circumstances reasonably beyond its control,
such as acts of God, labor strikes and availability.
8.Â Â Â Emergency Alert. Franchisee shall continue to provide an all-channel
audio-only emergency alert system for use by the City. Emergency messages can
be initiated from any touch-tone phone with an access code. Franchisee agrees
to upgrade the emergency alert system at the Franchiseeâs own cost, by
providing a text crawl on the picture on all channels within five years of the
effective date of this Franchise, providing such equipment is available at a
reasonable cost, which shall not exceed $15,000. The emergency alert service

regulations, or guidelines. The Franchisee shall not be held responsible for
any failure of the emergency alert system to operate during any emergency.

operated hereunder shall be installed and operated in conformance with the
Ordinance, this Franchise, and FCC rules and regulations. Any FCC technical

comply with the FCC standards which were in effect on the effective date of
this Franchise.

CUTOVER PROCESS
The upgrade will involve installing and activating fiber optics cable while the
coaxial cable is still activated and in operation. There will be a series of
fiber nodes designed for the upgrade. As each node is installed and completed,
it will be activated. The activation of one node will not interfere with or
interrupt the completion of a separate node. In the event the Company is
confronted with the loss of signal of more than one street at a time, the
Company will make every effort possible to complete the work during minimal
viewing, such as 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. or at the time recommended by the
City.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â On or about the third and sixth anniversaries of the effective date of
the franchise, the City may schedule a public meeting or meetings with the
Grantee to review the franchise performance, plans and prospects. The City may
require the Grantee to reasonably make available specified records, documents
and information for this purpose, and may inquire in particular whether the
Grantee is supplying a level and variety of services equivalent to those being
generally offered at that time in the industry in comparable market situations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The City shall first confer with the Grantee regarding modifications in
the franchise which might impose additional obligations on the Grantee, and the
Grantee may in turn seek to negotiate relaxation in any requirements previously
imposed on it which are subsequently shown to be impractical.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Within thirty (30) days of the conclusions of such negotiations, the
City may direct the Grantee to show cause why specified terms and conditions
should not be incorporated into the franchise and the Grantee may similarly
file with the City a written request that specified obligations of its
franchise be removed or relaxed. Implementation of such requests shall
correspond as nearly as possible with the procedures set forth herein. The
Broadband Telecommunications Commission will recommend to Council changes in
the franchised rights and obligations of the Grantee only if it finds from all
available evidence that such changes will not impair the economic viability of
the system or degrade the attractiveness of the systemâs service to present and
potential subscribers.
4.Â Â Â Expiration. Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under
this chapter, the City may in its sole discretion grant or deny renewal of the
franchise of the Grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act.

1.Â Â Â Franchise Nonexclusive. Any franchise granted hereunder by the City shall
not be exclusive and the City reserves the right to grant a franchise to any
person, firm, company, corporation or association at any time. The grant of one
franchise does not establish priority for use over the other present or future
permit or franchise holders or the Cityâs own use of the streets and public
grounds. The City shall at all times control the distribution of space in,
over, under or across all streets or public grounds occupied by the cable
system.
2.Â Â Â Franchise Amendable. The scope of any franchise granted hereunder shall be
deemed amendable from time to time by mutual consent, to allow the Grantee and
the City to innovate and implement new services and developments.
3.Â Â Â Privileges Must be Specified. No privilege or exemption shall be inferred
from the granting of any franchise unless it is specifically prescribed.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require the granting of a franchise
when in the opinion of the Council it would not be in the public interest to do
so.
4.Â Â Â Authority Granted. Any franchise granted hereunder shall give to the
Grantee the right and privilege to construct, erect, operate, modify and
maintain in, upon, along, above, over and under streets which have been or may

poles, cables, electronic equipment and other network appurtenances necessary
for the operation of a cable television system in the City, subject to
limitations contained in this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Previous Rights Abandoned. A franchise granted hereunder shall be in lieu
of any and all other rights, privileges, powers, immunities and authorities
owned, possessed, controlled or exercisable by a Grantee or any successor
pertaining to the construction, operation or maintenance of a cable system in
the City. The acceptance of a franchise shall operate, as between Grantee and
the City, as an abandonment of any and all such rights, privileges, powers,
immunities and authorities within the City. All construction, operation and
maintenance by the Grantee of any cable system in the City shall be under the
franchise and not under any other right, privilege, power, immunity or
authority.

shall at all times during the life of any franchise granted hereunder be
subject to all lawful exercise of the police power by the City and other duly

maintaining poles or conduits in the streets of the City, wherever the Grantee
finds it necessary to make use of said poles or conduits.
8.Â Â Â No Right of Property. The award of any franchise hereunder shall impart to
the Grantee no right of property in or on City-owned property.
9.Â Â Â Franchise Binding. All provisions of this chapter and any franchise
granted hereto shall be binding upon the Grantee, its successors, lessees or
assignees.
10.Â Â Â General City Ordinances. Any franchise granted by the City is hereby made
subject to the general ordinance provisions now in effect and hereafter made
effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements
of the various codes and ordinances of the City regarding permits, taxes, fees
to be paid, or manner of construction.
11.Â Â Â No Waiver of Rights. No course of dealing between the Grantee and the
City nor any delay on the part of the City in exercising any rights hereunder
shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the City or acquiescence in the
actions of the Grantee in contravention of rights except to the extent
expressly waived by the City or expressly provided for in the franchise.
113.04 THE CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE.
1.Â Â Â Franchise Required. No person, firm, company, corporation or association
shall construct, install, maintain or operate within any public street in the
City, or within any other public property of the City, any equipment or

to, modify or delete provisions of this chapter as it shall deem necessary in
the exercise of its regulatory powers. Provided, however, such exercise of

made only after a public hearing for which the Grantee shall have received
written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to such hearing.
5.Â Â Â Grantee Agrees to Cityâs Rights. The City reserves every right and power

Grantee is a party, provided, however, Grantee shall not be obligated to
indemnify the City for any such suit.
7.Â Â Â Powers of the City. Neither the granting of any franchise nor any
provision governing the franchise shall constitute a waiver or bar to the
exercise of any governmental right or power of the City.

any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the Grantee, at its
sole expense provided that such repairs are not necessitated by negligent act
of the City, in which case, cost for repairs shall be borne by the City.

denied to the Grantee by the City for any reason, the Grantee will make every
reasonable effort to provide service over alternate routes.

4.Â Â Â Local Employment and Procurement Practices. Whenever possible, all

lawful purpose, nor shall a Grantee refuse any person or organization the right
to cablecast pursuant to provisions of this chapter. The Grantee shall not, as
to rates, charges, service facilities, rules, regulations or in any other
respect, make or grant any unreasonable preference or advantage, not subject
any person to any prejudice or disadvantage. The Grantee shall take affirmative
steps to disseminate the information concerning the availability of its
services to all minority and other under represented groups. This provision
shall not be deemed to prohibit promotional campaigns to stimulate subscription
to the system or other legitimate uses thereof, nor shall it be deemed to
prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rate
schedules to which any customer coming within such classifications shall be
entitled, provided such schedules have been filed with the City as provided in
this chapter.
6.Â Â Â Fairness of Accessibility. The entire system of the Grantee shall be
operated in a manner consistent with the principle of fairness and equal

appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, furnish information concerning

the City office responsible for the administration of the franchise, including,
but not limited to, the address and telephone number of said office.
4.Â Â Â Equipment Service. The Grantee shall service or replace without charge all
equipment provided by it to the subscriber, provided, however, that the Grantee
may charge a subscriber for service to or replacement of any equipment damaged

Administrator may require the Grantee to investigate and report to the causes
and cures thereof, and the City Administrator may also conduct an
investigation. Thereafter, the City Administrator may order specified remedial
action to be taken within reasonably feasible time limits. If such action is
not taken, or is ineffective, or if within thirty (30) days the Grantee files
with the City a notice of objection to the order, the City may conduct a
hearing and may, if the evidence warrants a finding of fault on the part of the
Grantee, take appropriate action pursuant to the terms of this chapter.
113.31 TRANSFER.
1.Â Â Â Transfer of Franchise. A franchise shall not be assigned or transferred,
either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor
shall title to the cable system, legal or equitable, or any right, interest or
property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written
consent of the City, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except that
no consent shall be required for any sale, transfer, or assignment of ownership
to an affiliate under common control with Grantee, provided that prior to such
transfer, Grantee provides to the City verifiable information to establish that
such transferee has the financial, legal and technical ability to fully perform
all obligations of the franchise. No such consent shall be required, however,
for a transfer by mortgage to a federally licensed lending institution in order
to secure indebtedness. Within thirty (30) days of receiving the request for
transfer, the franchising authority shall, in accordance with FCC rules and
regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of the information it requires to
determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee.
If the franchising authority has not taken action on the Granteeâs request for
transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving such requested
information, consent by the franchising authority shall be deemed given.
2.Â Â Â Transfer of Ownership. The Grantee shall not sell, transfer or dispose of
thirty percent (30%) or greater ownership interest in the Grantee or more at
one time of the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or thirty
percent (30%) cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interests to
a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or
person or group of persons acting in concert without the consent of City. Every
sale, transfer, or disposition of thirty percent (30%) or greater ownership
interest as specified above in the Grantee shall make the franchise subject to
cancellation unless and until the City shall have consented thereto.
3.Â Â Â Transfer of Control. The Grantee shall not change control of the Grantee
in whatever manner exercised without the prior written consent of the City.
4.Â Â Â City Approval. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the
Grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the
City shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining whether it
shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the City may
inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public
interest qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and
the Grantee shall provide the City with all required information. The City
reserves the right to impose certain conditions on the transferee as a
condition of the franchise to ensure that the transferee is able to meet
existing ordinance and franchise requirements.
5.Â Â Â Assumption of Control. Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/
or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that it
will take control and operate the cable television system. If the financial
institution takes possession of the cable system the City shall take no action
to effect a termination of the franchise without first giving to the financial
institution written notice thereof and a period of six (6) months thereafter
(unless otherwise provided hereinbelow) (i) to allow the financial institution
or its agent(s) to continue operating as the Grantee under the franchise and;
(ii) to request the City, and for the City to determine whether, to consent to
the assignment of the Granteeâs rights, title, interest and obligations under
the franchise to a qualified operator. The City acknowledges that in order for
the financial institution to realize upon the collateral accorded to it by the
loan documents, the financial institution must be entitled to a reasonable
period of time after taking possession of the franchise under the loan document
to obtain the Cityâs consent to an assignment of the franchise to a qualified
operator. The City agrees that such reasonable period of time is six (6) months
after the financial institution takes possession of the cable communication
system and, further, agrees that the City shall use its best efforts to decide
upon the assignment of the franchise to the new operator proposed by the
financial institution within such period of time. The financial institution
shall be entitled to such possession and other rights granted under this
paragraph until such time that the City determines whether to consent to such
assignment (the âextended timeâ). If the City finds that such transfer, after
considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public
interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the City will
consent to the transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise
as in the public interest. During the six (6) month period or extended time,
the financial institution shall enjoy all the rights, benefits and privileges
of the Grantee under the franchise, and the City shall not disturb such
possession by the financial institution, provided the financial institution
complies in all respects with the terms and provisions of the franchise and
this chapter. The various rights granted to the financial institution under
this section are contingent upon the financial institutionâs continuous
compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise
during the entire aforementioned six (6) month period or extended time if
applicable. For example, should an agent of the financial institution take
possession of the cable communication system pursuant to rights granted to the
financial institution under this paragraph, and such agent fails to comply with
the level of service requirements set forth in this chapter or the franchise,
the rights granted to the financial institution under this chapter and the
franchise shall automatically terminate.
6.Â Â Â No Waiver of City Property Rights. The consent or approval of the City or
any other public entity to any transfer of the Grantee shall not constitute a
waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the public property or
public rights of way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
7.Â Â Â Transfer Time Periods. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the
City will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to
construction or the completion of the upgrade of the system. Subject to the
conditions of Section 617 of the Cable Act, the City shall not approve a
transfer if the Grantee has not held the franchise for a period of three years.
8.Â Â Â Right to Review Purchase Price. Based upon public information, the City
reserves the right to review the purchase price of any transfer or assignment
of the cable system.
9.Â Â Â Signatory Requirement. Any approval by the City of transfer of ownership
or control shall be contingent upon the prospective party becoming a signatory
to the franchise agreement.
113.32 PUBLICATION COSTS.
The Grantee shall assume the cost of publication of the franchise ordinance as
such publication is required by law. A bill for the publication costs shall be
presented to the Grantee by the City upon the Granteeâs filing of acceptance
and shall be paid at that time.
113.33 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.
Whenever this chapter sets forth any time for any act to be performed by or on
behalf of the Grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any failure
of the Grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient
ground for the City to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible
revocation of the franchise.
113.34 NO WAIVER OF RIGHTS.
No course of dealing between the Grantee and the City nor any delay on the part
of the City in exercising any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any
such rights of the City or acquiescence in the actions of the Grantee in
contravention of rights except to the extent expressly waived by the City or
expressly provided for in the franchise.
113.35 RATE REGULATION PROCEEDINGS.
Any rate regulation proceedings conducted under this chapter shall provide a
reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of any interested party,
including but not limited to the City, by its designee, the cable operator,
subscribers, and residents of the franchise area. In addition to all other
provisions required by the laws of the State and the City for such proceedings,
and in order to provide for such opportunity for consideration of the views of
any interested party, the City shall take the following actions:
1.Â Â Â The City shall publish in a local newspaper of general circulation, post
on a bulletin board or other prominent place easily accessible to the public
and clearly designated for that purpose in the Coralville City Hall, and mail
by certified mail to the cable operator a public notice of the intent to
conduct a public proceeding on basic service tier rates and/or charges for
equipment to receive such basic service tier, as defined by the FCC.
2.Â Â Â The public notice shall contain a statement that cable television rates
are subject to municipal review and shall explain the nature of the rate review
in question; that any interested party has a right to participate in the
proceeding; that public views may be submitted in the proceeding, explaining
how such public views are to be submitted and the deadline for submitting such
views; that a decision concerning the reasonableness of the cable television
rates in question will be governed by the rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC); and that the decision of the City is subject
to review by the FCC.
3.Â Â Â The City shall conduct a public proceeding to determine whether the rates
or proposed rate increase are reasonable. The City may delegate the
responsibility to conduct the proceeding to the Broadband Telecommunications
Commission or to any duly qualified and eligible individual or entity. If the
City or its designee cannot determine the reasonableness of a proposed rate
increase within the time period permitted by the FCC rules and regulations, it
may roll the effective date of the proposed rates for an additional period of
time as permitted by the FCC rules and regulations, and may issue any other
necessary or appropriate order and give public notice accordingly.
4.Â Â Â In the course of the rate regulation proceeding, the City may request
additional information from the cable operator that is reasonably necessary to
determine the reasonableness of the basic service tier rates and equipment
charges. Any such additional information submitted to the City shall be
verified by an appropriate official of the cable television system supervising
the preparation of the response on behalf of the entity, and submitted by way
of affidavit or under penalty of perjury, stating that the response is true and
accurate to the best of that personâs knowledge, information and belief formed
after reasonable inquiry. The City may request proprietary information,
provided that the City shall consider a timely request from the cable operator
that said proprietary information shall not be made available for public
information, consistent with the procedures set forth in section 0.459 of the
FCC rules and regulations. Furthermore, said proprietary information may be
used only for the purpose of determining the reasonableness of the rates and
charges or the appropriate rate level submitted by the cable operator. The City
may exercise all powers under the laws of evidence applicable to administrative
proceedings under the laws of the State to discover any information relevant to
the rate regulation proceeding, including, but not limited to, subpoena,
interrogatories, production of documents and depositions.
5.Â Â Â Upon termination of the rate regulation proceeding, the City shall adopt
and release a written decision whether the rates or proposed rate increase are
reasonable or unreasonable, and, if unreasonable, its remedy, including
prospective rate reduction, rate prescription and refunds.
6.Â Â Â The City may not impose any fines, penalties, forfeitures or other
sanctions, other than permitted by the FCC rules and regulations, for charging
an unreasonable rate or proposing an unreasonable rate increase. However, the
City may impose fines or monetary forfeitures on a cable operator that does not
comply with a rate decision or refund order of the City, directed specifically
at the cable operator, pursuant to the laws of the State and this Code of
Ordinances.
7.Â Â Â Consistent with the FCC rules and regulations, the Cityâs decision may be
reviewed only by the FCC.
8.Â Â Â The City shall be authorized, at any time, to gather information as
necessary to exercise its jurisdiction as authorized by the laws of the state,
the Cable Act, and the FCC rules and regulations. Any information submitted to
the City shall be verified by an appropriate official of the cable television
system supervising the preparation of the response on behalf of the entity, and
submitted by way of affidavit or under penalty of perjury, stating that the
response is true and accurate to the best of that personâs knowledge,
information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry.
113.36 CERTIFICATION.
The City shall file with the FCC the required certification form (FCC Form 328)
on September l, 1993, or as soon thereafter as appropriate. Thirty (30) days
later, or as soon thereafter as appropriate, the City shall notify the cable
operator that the City has been certified by the FCC and that it has adopted
all necessary regulations so as to begin regulating basic service tier cable
television rates and equipment charges.
113.37 NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.
With regard to the cable programming service tier, as defined by the Cable Act
and the FCC rules and regulations, and over which the City is not empowered to
exercise rate regulation, the cable operator shall give notice to the City of
any change in rates for the cable programming service tier or tiers, any change
in the charge for equipment required to receive the tier or tiers, and any
changes in the nature of the services provided, including the program services
included in the tier or tiers. Said notice shall be provided to the City at
least thirty (30) business days prior to any change becoming effective.
113.38 CABLE OFFICIAL.
The City may delegate its power to enforce this chapter to the Broadband
Telecommunications Commission or to employees or officers of the City, to be
known as the cable official. The cable official shall have authority to:
1.Â Â Â Administer oaths and affirmations;
2.Â Â Â Issue subpoenas;
3.Â Â Â Examine witnesses;
4.Â Â Â Rule upon questions of evidence;
5.Â Â Â Take or cause depositions to be taken;
6.Â Â Â Conduct proceedings in accordance with this chapter;

person in whose favor the waiver is made may be interred therein, provided that
the order of interment as provided in this section shall be subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â If no interment has been made in a burial plot which has been transferred
by a right of interment document to an individual owner by the City or if all

by the provisions of this chapter.

ownerâs heirs, as the case may be, to their last known address. If the address
of the owner or the ownerâs heirs cannot be ascertained, notice of such
abandonment shall be by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation
in the County. If such notice is not responded to within 90 days from the date
of service, mailing or publication, the interment spaces shall be deemed
abandoned, and all right therein reverts to the City.

140.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
The City Council of Coralville, Iowa, finds, determines, and declares that:
1.Â Â Â Redevelopment of commercial property in the Commerce Drive-Iowa Highway
965/U.S. Highway 6 area without improvements to the street system is contrary
to the public interest.
2.Â Â Â It is undesirable to wait until a significant decline in traffic service
and safety related problems occur before making improvements to the street
system in areas of significant commercial redevelopment.
3.Â Â Â The City has identified specific improvements to the street system in the
Commerce Drive-Iowa Highway 965/U.S. Highway 6 area which will accommodate
redevelopment of commercial properties, and the City Council recognizes that
said improvements to the street system are necessary to promote and protect the
public health, safety and welfare.
4.Â Â Â City involvement in improvements to the street system is appropriate for
streets which are designated collectors or arterials in the functional
classification of streets within Coralville.
5.Â Â Â The imposition of impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring
that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of street
improvements necessary to accommodate such development.
6.Â Â Â New commercial development in the Commerce Drive-Iowa Highway 965/U.S.
Highway 6 area will create demand for improvements to the street system.
7.Â Â Â The fee established in Section
140.06 hereof is derived from, based upon, and does not exceed the impact
created by the new commercial development for which the fee is to be charged.
8.Â Â Â The fee established by this chapter does not constitute a tax.
140.02 AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY.
1.Â Â Â The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the âCommerce
Drive-Iowa Highway 965/U.S. Highway 6 Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance.â
2.Â Â Â The Council has the authority to adopt said ordinance under its Home Rule
powers, pursuant to Article 3, Section 38A of the Constitution of the State of
Iowa, and Chapter 364 of the State Code of Iowa.
3.Â Â Â This chapter shall apply to all real property in the Commerce Drive-Iowa
Highway 965/U.S. Highway 6 area which is specifically designated as Parcel A,
Parcel B, and Parcel C in
Figure 1 attached hereto and incorporated by this reference.
140.03 INTENTS AND PURPOSES.
1.Â Â Â This chapter is intended to assist in the implementation of the Coralville
Community Plan and the West Coralville Land Use Plan.
2.Â Â Â The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that new commercial development
in the Commerce Drive-Iowa Highway 965/U.S. Highway 6 area bears a

adequate traffic service and provide safe access to properties in the Commerce
Drive-Iowa Highway 965/U.S. Highway 6 area in Coralville.
140.04 DEFINITIONS.
1.Â Â Â âFee payerâ means a person applying for the issuance of a building permit
for commercial development in Parcel A, Parcel B or Parcel C in
Figure 1 attached hereto.
2.Â Â Â âCapital improvementâ includes land and easement acquisition, demolition,
street construction, installation of utilities, installation of traffic
signals, and construction administration, but excludes maintenance and
operating expenditures. A âcapital improvementâ shall also include the cost of
design, engineering, necessary consultants and financing of a capital
improvement, including debt service.

140.05 TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE AUTHORIZED.
1.Â Â Â Any person who, after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, seeks to develop land within Parcel A, Parcel B, or Parcel C of the
Commerce Drive-Iowa Highway 965/U.S. Highway 6 area by applying for a building
permit, is hereby required to pay a Transportation Impact Fee in the manner and
amount set forth in this chapter.
2.Â Â Â No new building permit requiring the payment of an impact fee pursuant to
this chapter shall be issued unless and until the Transportation Impact Fee
hereby required has been paid.
140.06 COMPUTATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSPORTA-TION IMPACT FEE.
The impact fees imposed by this chapter are based upon current best estimates
of the capital improvement costs of the street improvements required in the
Commerce Drive-Iowa Highway 965/U.S. Highway 6 area. The total transportation
impact fees for Parcel A, Parcel B, and Parcel C are computed as follows:
Intersection #1: Iowa Highway 965/Commerce Drive:
Parcel A & Parcel B Impact Fees
Required Improvements
Â Â Â Remove existing pavementÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 22,800
Â Â Â Construct turn and through lanesÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 659,200
Â Â Â Install traffic signalÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 78,400
Â Â Â Engineering and construction administrationÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 156,100
Â Â Â Total ImprovementsÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 916,500
Calculation of Impact Fee
Â·Â Â Â Estimated square feet GFA from 28.51 ac. Parcel A = 310,474 square feet.
Â·Â Â Â Estimated square feet GFA from 8.09 ac. Parcel B = 88,100 square feet.
Â·Â Â Â Estimated trip generation from Parcels A & B (C-2 Arterial Commercial
zoning): 65 trips/1,000 square feet GFA/weekday. (Source: ITE Trip Generation
Manual, Fourth Edition; average of trip rates for (814) Specialty Retail Center
and (815) Discount Store).
Â·Â Â Â Parcel A: 310 X 65 = 20,150 estimated trip generation.
Â Â Â Parcel B: 88 X 65 = 5,720 estimated trip generation.
Â·Â Â Â Parcel A: pass-by and multi-purpose trip adjustment: .25 X 20,150 = 5,038
Â Â Â Parcel B: pass-by and multi-purpose trip adjustment: .25 X 5,720 = 1,430
Â Â Â Note: The pass-by and multi-purpose trip adjustment is for trips generated
that are already passing by the site on the arterial street and for multi-
purpose trips to more than one destination in the area. These factors are high
(75%) for commercial developments on an arterial street.
Â·Â Â Â Net trip generation from Parcel A: 5,038 trips per day.
Â Â Â Net trip generation from Parcel B: 1,430 trips per day.
Â·Â Â Â Estimated build-out Hwy. 965 entering volume = 24,900.
Â·Â Â Â Estimated build-out ramp entering volume = 8,750.
Â·Â Â Â Additional Commerce Drive background volume = 570.
Â Â Â (Source CH2M Hill technical memorandum dated August 9, 1996: Addendum to
Revised Traffic Forecast and Operational Analysis.)
Â·Â Â Â Build-out (year 2007) estimated total intersection entering volume:
Â 
Highway 965 both approaches:      24,900 (61%)
Ramp approach:                    8,750  (22%)
Parcel A:                         5,038  (12%)
Parcel B:                         1,430  (4%)
Commerce drive additional volume: 570    (1%)
                                  40,688 (100%)
Â 
Parcel A impact fee = $916,500 X 12% = $109,980
Parcel B impact fee = $916,500 X 4% = $36,660

Â Â Â Total ImprovementsÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 468,700
Calculation of Impact Fee
Commerce Drive is functionally classified as collector street within the
Coralville street network. As a collector street it is intended that the
streetâs function be split equally between traffic circulation and property
access. Although the need to add two additional lanes to Commerce Drive at this
point in time is predicated on the redevelopment of Parcels A and B according
to the C-2 Arterial Commercial zoning classification, the need for the street
to be four lanes is also impacted by the traffic circulation function within
the entire Heartland Plaza subdivision.
The property access portion of the proposed Commerce Drive improvements (fifty
percent of the total) should be split between all lots with direct access to
the proposed improvement. This consists of Parcels A and B shown in
Figure 1. The fee for each parcel should be based on total projected trip
generation.
Note: The detail for the calculation of projected trip generation from Parcels
A and B is summarized on Page 584.2.
Â·Â Â Â Property access portion of total expense: $468,700 X 50% = $234,350.
Â·Â Â Â Total Projected trip generation from Parcels A & B:Â Â Â Parcel A = 20,150
(78%)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Parcel B = 5,720 (22%)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  25,870 (100%)
Parcel A impact fee = $234,350 X 78% = $182,793
Parcel B impact fee = $234,350 X 22% = $51,557

Â Â Â Subtotal fifth and sixth lanesÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 662,000.00
Â Â Â Total ImprovementsÂ Â Â $Â Â Â 1,694,600.00
Calculation of Impact Fee
Â·Â Â Â Estimated square feet GFA from 37.27 ac. Parcel C = 405,870 square feet.
Â·Â Â Â Estimated trip generation from Parcel C (C-2 Arterial Commercial zoning):
65 trips/1,000 square feet GFA/weekday. (Source: ITE Trip Generation Manual
Fourth Edition; average of trip rates (814) Specialty Retail Center and (815)
Discount Store).
Â·Â Â Â Parcel C: 406 X 65 = 26,390 estimated trip generation.
Â·Â Â Â Parcel C: pass-by and multi-purpose trip adjustment: .25 X 26,390 = 6,597.
Â Â Â Note: The pass-by and multi-purpose trip adjustment is for trips generated
that are already passing by the site on the arterial street, and for multi-
purpose trips to more than one destination in the area. These factors are high
(75%) for commercial developments on an arterial street.
Â·Â Â Â Net trip generation from Parcel C: 6,597 trips per day.
Â·Â Â Â Parcel C directional distribution: 80% to intersection #3; 20% to Hwy. 965
right-in/right-out.
Â Â Â The directional distribution is used to estimate how the total trips
generated will be distributed to multiple access points. Parcel C will have two
access points, intersection #3 on Hwy. 6, and a right-in/right-out on Hwy. 965.
Â·Â Â Â Net trip generation from Parcel C to intersection #3; 5,277 trips per day.
Â·Â Â Â Net trip generation from Parcel C to Hwy. 965 right-in/right-out: 1320
trips per day.
Â Â Â It is estimated 90% of Parcel C traffic using intersection #3 will travel
through the Hwy. 6/Hwy. 965 intersection. 100% of the Parcel C traffic using
the Hwy. 965 right-in/right-out will travel through the Hwy. 6/Hwy. 965
intersection.
Â·Â Â Â Total Parcel C trip generation that will impact Hwy. 6/Hwy. 965
intersection: 6,069 vehicles per day.
Â·Â Â Â Estimated build-out (2007) Hwy. 6/Hwy. 965 entering volume: 36,800 vehicles
per day.
Â Â Â (Source: CH2M Hill technical memorandum dated August 9, 1996: Addendum to
Revised Traffic Forecast and Operational Analysis).
Â·Â Â Â Percentage of Hwy. 6/Hwy. 965 build-out (2007) entering volume attributable
to Parcel C: 16% .
Parcel C impact fee = $1,694,600 X 16% = $271,136.

141.01 PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The City Council of the City of Coralville, Johnson County, Iowa, hereby finds
it is necessary and desirable to establish uniform rules and controls: (a) to
ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by the City and
others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for the delivery of
utility or other services; (b) to protect public and private investment; (c) to
ensure the orderly use of public property and the health, safety, and welfare
of the population; and (d) to provide for the regulation and administration of
the public streets and other public property. This chapter is to be interpreted
in light of these findings for the benefit of the public and users of the City
streets and other public property. Accordingly, this chapter imposes fair,
efficient, competitively neutral, uniform and reasonable regulations on the
placement and maintenance of equipment currently within the Cityâs right-of-way
or to be placed herein. Under this chapter, persons disturbing and obstructing
the right-of-way shall bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for
right-of-way degradation.
141.02 DEFINITIONS.
The following definitions shall apply in this chapter. References to âSectionsâ
shall hereafter mean references to sections in this chapter unless otherwise
specified. Defined terms remain defined terms whether or not capitalized.

sites; (v) updating mapping systems; (vi) determining the adequacy of right-of-
way restoration; (vii) budget analysis, record keeping, legal assistance;
(viii) and performing all of the other tasks required by this chapter,
including other costs the City may incur in managing the provisions of this
chapter except as expressly prohibited by law. Without limiting the generality
of the immediately preceding sentence, âcity costâ does not include the costs
incurred by the City for routine landscaping, mowing and snow removal, nor does
it include costs incurred in connection with seasonal, celebratory or event-
oriented decorating of City rights-of-way, including, by way of example, for
Christmas, July 4th, the Summer Music in the Park Series, or RAGBRAI.
4.Â Â Â âCity Inspectorâ means any person authorized by the City to carry out
inspections related to the provisions of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â âDegradationâ means the accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way

need for reconstruction in such right-of-way earlier than would be required if
the excavation did not occur, as determined by the City Inspector in accordance
with those standards set forth in the Right-of-way Access Standards Book.
6.Â Â Â âDesignated contact personâ means the person authorized by a registrant to
accept service and to make decisions for that registrant regarding all matters
within the scope of this chapter.

television, cable television, fire and alarm communications, water,
electricity, City sanitary sewer services, light, heat, cooling energy, or
power services. Without negating the generality of the immediately preceding
sentence, âEquipmentâ does not include City paving, street lighting, sidewalks
and storm sewers, since same constitute integral parts of the City right-of-way
itself. Neither boulevard paintings nor gardens planted or maintained in the
right-of-way shall be considered âequipmentâ for purposes of this chapter.
9.Â Â Â âExcavateâ means to dig into or in any way remove or physically disturb or
penetrate any part of a right-of-way for purposes of installing, constructing,

141.07 PERFORMANCE AND RESTORATION BOND REQUIRED.
1.Â Â Â Any person shall, as part of the application process for an excavation
permit, post a performance and restoration bond acceptable to the City. Said
performance and restoration bond shall be in an amount determined by the City
Inspector to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the right-of-way to
its proper and required condition pursuant to the Cityâs Right-of-way Access
Standards Book or such other additional specifications required by the City
Inspector pursuant to Section
141.15(1) of this chapter. If at the conclusion of the sixty (60) month period
required under Section
141.15 of this chapter, the City Inspector determines that the right-of-way has
been properly restored, the surety on the performance and restoration bond
shall be released.
2.Â Â Â The performance and restoration bond shall be conditioned upon:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The faithful performance of the right-of-way restoration work required
under this chapter, or payment of the restoration costs incurred by the City;
and
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The faithful performance of the terms of the permit, the provisions of
this chapter, and any other requirements provided by law.
3.Â Â Â If the permittee fails or neglects to properly restore the right-of-way to
its proper condition within the time for completion set forth in the permit, or
within a reasonable time after notice by the City Inspector of said failure or
neglect, or fails to the pay the restoration costs incurred by the City, or
fails or neglects to properly maintain the right-of-way to its proper condition
within a reasonable time after notice by the City Inspector of said failure or
neglect, or fails to pay the maintenance costs incurred by the City, then the
same shall be restored or maintained by the City and the costs thereof, as
certified by the City Inspector, shall be promptly paid by the permittee or
bonding company, as the case may be.
4.Â Â Â In lieu of filing a performance and restoration bond hereunder, a
permittee may, in the discretion of the City Inspector, be allowed to post an
alternate form of security with the City in the form of an annual performance
and restoration bond, letter of credit, certificate of deposit, or certified
check in an amount deemed sufficient by the City Inspector, but in no event
less than $10,000.00 (ten thousand dollars), to secure the permitteeâs
performance of all restoration work which the permittee will become responsible
for during the next twelve (12) month period. Such alternate form of security
shall be conditioned upon permitteeâs performance as provided in subsection 3
of this section. If the restoration costs, as certified by the City Inspector
during said year, are less than such letter of credit, certificate of deposit,
or certified check, or if maintenance period provided for in the permit has
expired with the permittee having satisfied all of its restoration and
maintenance responsibilities, the balance thereof shall upon request be
returned to the permittee. If it appears to the City Inspector that at any time
after issuance of a permit that the security so provided by letter of credit,
certificate of deposit, or certified check is inadequate to secure performance
of all such restoration work, the City Inspector may require the permittee to
increase such security. If the costs during said year exceed the amount of such
additional security provided by letter of credit, certificate of deposit, or
certified check, the permittee shall be required to pay such difference to the
City. Such excess costs shall be paid before any subsequent permit hereunder
may be issued. If the City incurs any outlay and expense in collecting its
costs from the permittee, such outlay and expense shall be paid by the
permittee or bonding company in addition to other amounts due.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Timely pays all fees as provided herein; and
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Complies with all other requirements of law.
2.Â Â Â The grant of right to occupy hereunder is expressly conditioned on, and is
subject to, the police powers of the City, continuing compliance with all
provisions of law now or hereafter enacted, including this chapter as it may be
from time to time amended and, further, is specifically subject to the
obligation to obtain any and all additional required authorizations, whether
from the City or other governmental body or authority.

of this chapter, the City may issue a permit.
2.Â Â Â The City may impose any reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a
permit and the performance of the applicant thereunder to protect the public
health, safety and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the right-of-
way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the right-of-way, to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public, and to
otherwise efficiently manage use of the right-of-way.
141.15 RIGHT-OF-WAY RESTORATION.
1.Â Â Â In addition to repairing its own work, the permittee must restore the
permit area and the adjacent areas, including the paving and its foundations,
to its proper and required condition in accordance with those standards set
forth in the Right-of-way Access Standards Book, unless the City Inspector
deems other or additional specifications must be utilized in order to secure
proper restoration of the permit area. Further, the permittee must inspect the
area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for
sixty (60) months thereafter and as more fully set forth below.
2.Â Â Â If an applicant for an excavation permit has not qualified to perform
right-of-way restoration work as hereinafter provided, or if a qualified
applicant chooses to have the City restore the right-of-way, the applicant
shall pay the costs thereof within thirty (30) days of billing. If, during the
sixty (60) months following such restoration, the pavement settles due to the
permitteeâs improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the City, within
thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of repairing said pavement.
3.Â Â Â An applicant for an excavation permit which has been determined qualified
to perform right-of-way restoration work as hereinafter provided, and which
intends to itself restore the right-of-way, shall so indicate in its
application for an excavation permit The permittee shall perform the work in
accordance with subsection 1 of this section. The City Inspector shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
City Inspector, in exercising this authority, shall be guided by the following
standards and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the
excavations, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way; the pre-excavation
condition of the right-of-way; the remaining life expectancy of the right-of-
way affected by the excavation; whether the relative cost of the method of
restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of
the accelerated degradation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result
from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and the
likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in
slowing the degradation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â By choosing to restore the right-of-way itself, the permittee
guarantees its work and shall maintain it for sixty (60) months following its
completion. During this 60-month period, it shall, upon notification from the
City Inspector, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the
method required by the City. Said work shall be completed within five (5)
calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the City Inspector.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to
the condition required by the City Inspector, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City Inspector, the City, at its
option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City,
within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs incurred by the City in restoring
the right-of-way.
4.Â Â Â The qualifications of any person owning or operating a utility service, or
any person seeking to become qualified to perform right-of-way restoration work
under this chapter shall be determined by the City Inspector. In making this
determination, the City Inspector may consider any of the following factors,
which shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Inspector:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The financial responsibility of the applicant;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Cityâs past record of transactions and experience with the
applicant, including the quality of workmanship on past right-of-way
restoration projects; the number of liens, claims or complaints filed regarding
such past projects; and the number of repairs made on prior right-of-way
restoration projects involving that applicant;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The adequacy of the applicantâs equipment and materials;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The competency and experience of the applicantâs managerial and
supervisory personnel in performing right-of-way restoration work;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The applicantâs demonstrated ability to complete performance of right-
of-way restoration work or work of a similar nature.
5.Â Â Â The City Inspector may decline to qualify an applicant for the performance
of right-of-way restoration work if the City Inspector determines that the
applicant has not demonstrated satisfactory compliance with the above-
referenced criteria, or if the City Inspector determines that the applicant
has:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Without good cause therefor failed to carry on or complete prior right-
of-way restoration work or work of a similar nature in an acceptable manner, or
refused to comply with a written order of the City Inspector with regard
thereto within a reasonable time; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Failed to perform prior right-of-way restoration work or work of a
similar nature in reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications
therefor, or in reasonably close conformity with the Cityâs Right-of-way Access
Standards Book; or
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Failed or refused to remove and replace materials or work found by the
City Inspector not to be in reasonably close conformity with the Cityâs Right-
of-way Access Standards Book, or failed to correct such material or work so as
to cause such materials or finished product to be reasonably acceptable work.
6.Â Â Â In the event the City Inspector determines not to qualify an applicant to
perform right-of-way restoration work, the City Inspector shall so notify the
affected applicant in writing. The notice shall set forth the reasons
supporting the City Inspectorâs determination not to qualify an applicant and
shall indicate that the City Inspectorâs determination shall be considered
final unless the applicant requests an appeal in accordance with Section
141.25 of this chapter.
7.Â Â Â Upon a determination by the City Inspector that a person previously
qualified to perform right-of-way restoration work either has failed to meet
any of the criteria set forth in this section, or has failed to perform as
provided under this section, the City Inspector may disqualify such person from
the further performance of such work, as hereinafter provided. Upon making said
determination, the City Inspector shall give notice to the affected party of
his/her determination, and shall therein set forth the reasons supporting
disqualification and the proposed period for disqualification, and shall
indicate that the City Inspectorâs determination shall be considered final
unless the applicant requests an appeal of that determination in accordance
with Section
141.25 of this chapter.
8.Â Â Â All of the bonding and restoration requirements set forth for excavations
and the issuance of excavation permits shall also be applicable to obstructions
and the issuance of obstruction permits if the City Inspector determines that,
as a result of vehicular traffic being detoured for the duration of a proposed
obstruction, alternate City right-of-way(s) or portions thereof shall suffer
increased degradation to the extent that restoration is deemed appropriate
under the Cityâs Right-of-way Access Standards Book.
141.16 JOINT APPLICATIONS
1.Â Â Â Registrants may jointly make application for permits to excavate or
obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
2.Â Â Â Registrants who join in and during a scheduled obstruction or excavation
performed by the City, whether or not it is a joint application by two (2) or
more registrants or a single application, are not required to satisfy the
restoration requirements set forth in Section
141.15.
3.Â Â Â Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation,
which is not performed by the City, may share the restoration obligations set

obligations shall be allocated between themselves and indicate the same on
their joint application.
141.17 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified
in the permit. No permittee may perform any work outside the area specified in
the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an

necessitated thereby; and
2.Â Â Â Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
141.18 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
1.Â Â Â In the event that any proposed work for which the applicable right-of-way
permits have been obtained appears reasonably likely to risk serious damage to
tree(s) in or near the permit area, the registrant shall expressly inform the
City Inspector of such risk prior to the commencement of any such work and take
all the steps requested by the City Inspector to avoid or minimize damage to
existing City trees. Furthermore, all of the work performed under this chapter

and maintenance of equipment in the right-of-way. The registrantâs equipment
located in the right-of-way shall conform to established grades of streets and
sidewalks and be so located as:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To cause minimum interference with public utilities or property or
private property located in the right-of-way at the grant or authorization of
the City, including, without limitation, the natural free and clear passage of
water through gutters, storm sewers or other waterways; and
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of the owners of property adjoining the right-of-way.
3.Â Â Â The registrant shall carry on all excavation, installation, maintenance,
repair and restoration activities within the right-of-way with utmost regard to
the safety of the public and adjacent property owners. Further, the registrant
shall conduct any of the aforementioned activities in such a manner as to cause
as little interference as possible with pedestrian and vehicular traffic. If
the City Inspector determines that it is necessary for the Registrant to
provide traffic control to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the public,
the registrant shall do so at its sole expense and in accordance with Iowa
Department of Transportation safety standards and guidelines. The registrant
shall coordinate all traffic control required for such activities within the
right-of-way with the City Inspector prior to the commencement of same. Private
vehicles shall not be parked adjacent to the permit area. The loading or
unloading of trucks adjacent to the permit area is prohibited unless
specifically authorized by the permit.
141.19 DENIAL OF PERMIT.
1.Â Â Â The City may deny any application for a permit:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To any person who has failed to register and fully satisfy all
application requirements in connection with the proposed excavation or
obstruction;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To any person (except a telecommunications provider) who has failed
within the past three (3) years to comply, or is not presently in full
compliance, with the terms and provisions of this chapter; or
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If, in the sole discretion of the City, the issuance of a permit for a
particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an
exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event.
2.Â Â Â The City may deny a permit in order to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-
of-way and its users. The City may consider one or more of the following
factors:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The extent to which the right-of-way space where the permit is sought
is available;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other
rights-of-way for the equipment of the applicant;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The applicability of any other ordinances or State or Federal laws or
regulations that affect location of equipment in the right-of-way;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and conditions
of its franchise, this chapter, and other applicable ordinances or State or
Federal laws or regulations;
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The degree of disruption to the City and surrounding businesses that
will result from the proposed use of that part of the right-of-way;
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The condition and age of the right-of-way, and whether and when it is
scheduled for total or partial reconstruction; and
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to
the right-of-way against the benefits to that part of the public serviced by
the expansion into additional parts of the right-of-way.
3.Â Â Â Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding subsection 2,
the City may issue a permit for good cause shown in any case where the permit
is necessary:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
applicant;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To allow such customer to materially improve its utility service; or
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To allow a new economic development project and where the applicant did
not have knowledge of any of the foregoing at the time the applicant was
required to submit its list of Next-Year-Projects.
Additionally, the City may issue a permit to a registrant who properly and
timely listed additional Next-Year-Projects under the terms of Section
141.11 of this chapter, or if the registrant demonstrates that it used
commercially reasonable efforts to anticipate and plan for proposed additional
projects, such permit to be subject to all other conditions and requirements of
law, including such conditions as may be imposed under Section
141.14 of this chapter.
141.20 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
All work within the right-of-way shall be done in accordance with the Right-of-
way Access Standards Book and at a location as determined under Section
141.27 of this chapter.
141.21 INSPECTION.
The City Inspector shall be afforded full access to registrantâs work-sites to
review compliance with the terms of this chapter and to make any inspection or
test that the City determines is necessary to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, and to ensure that the work for which the applicable permit was
granted is being carried out in the authorized area of the right-of-way and
within the permitted time limit. The City Inspector may issue an order to the
registrant for any work which does not conform to the applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation within ten (10) days after issuance of the order will be cause for
revocation of the permit pursuant to Section
141.24 of this chapter. The City Inspector shall not, however, make any
determinations or have control over the registrantâs work other than to require
that same be carried out in compliance with this chapter, within the authorized
area of the right-of-way, and within the time permitted for the work. The City
Inspector shall not make any determinations or have authority over or
responsibility for the means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures of
work being performed by the registrant, for safety precautions and programs
incident to the work, or for any failure of the registrant to comply with
applicable laws, rules and regulations governing registrantâs performance of
the work. The City Inspector shall not make any determinations or have
authority over or responsibility for the structural integrity or safety of any
non-City equipment constructed, installed, repaired, reconstructed, replaced or
restored in the right-of-way, nor shall it make any determinations or have
authority over or responsibility for the ability of non-City equipment to
function as intended in the right-of-way.
141.22 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
1.Â Â Â In the event of an emergency, the registrant may proceed to take whatever
actions concerning its equipment which it determines are necessary to respond
to the emergency. Each registrant shall subsequently notify the City of the
event as soon as is reasonably practicable. Within two (2) business days
thereafter, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to
bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in
response to the emergency.
2.Â Â Â In the event that the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a
registrantâs equipment, the City may attempt to contact the designated contact
person. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems reasonably
necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
registrant.
3.Â Â Â Except in the case of an emergency, any person who, without first having
obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must
subsequently obtain a permit; pay double the normal fee for said permit; pay
double all other fees required under this Code of Ordinances, including,
without limitation, criminal fines and penalties; deposit with the City the
fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way; and comply with all
of the requirements of this chapter. In the event that the City subsequently
determines that an alleged emergency situation that would supersede the
requirement for all necessary permits hereunder was not an emergency, the terms
of this subsection shall apply.
141.23 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the City
of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
141.24 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
1.Â Â Â If the City determines that the permittee has committed a material breach
of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any
condition of an applicable permit, the City shall make written demand upon the
permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued
violation may be cause for the immediate forfeiture of the permitteeâs
franchise, the termination of all rights thereunder, and the revocation of all
rights established and granted under this chapter. Further, a material breach,
as set forth above, shall allow the City, at the Cityâs discretion, to place
additional or revised conditions on the applicable permit.
2.Â Â Â Within ten (10) business days after receiving written notification of the
breach, the permittee shall provide the City with a written plan, acceptable to
the City Inspector, for its correction. Permitteeâs failure to so contact the
City Inspector, the permitteeâs failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the
permitteeâs failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause
for immediate forfeiture of the permitteeâs franchise, the termination of all
rights hereunder, and the revocation of all rights established and granted
under this chapter. Further, the permitteeâs failure to so contact the City
Inspector, or the permitteeâs failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the
permitteeâs failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one (1) year.
3.Â Â Â If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall reimburse the City for the
Cityâs reasonable costs, including, but not limited to, restoration costs, the
costs of collection, and reasonable attorneyâs fees incurred in connection with
such revocation.
4.Â Â Â In addition to the specific remedies set forth above, any material breach
of the terms of this chapter shall constitute a municipal infraction as set
forth in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.
141.25 APPEALS.
1.Â Â Â The City Council, in regular or special session, shall sit as a right-of-
way appeal board and, on appeals under this chapter, may seek and retain
additional professional counsel schooled in matters contained in this chapter.
A simple majority of the appeal board shall be deemed sufficient to settle
matters brought before the board.
2.Â Â Â The Council, sitting as an appeal board, shall hold meetings from time to
time and conduct hearings on appeals. The appeal board shall act within sixty
(60) days on a timely written request, and if the appeal board fails to act
within sixty (60) days after the filing of a timely written appeal, the appeal
shall be deemed granted in favor of the appellant.
3.Â Â Â Any person aggrieved by any ruling, decision, interpretation or order of
the City Inspector shall have the right to appeal to the right-of-way appeal
board by filing a written notice of such appeal with the City Clerk within ten
(10) business days from the date of the City Inspectorâs ruling. If such a
notice is filed, the appeal board shall set a time and place for hearing and so
notify the party that has filed the appeal. The hearing shall be open to the
public and subject to the time limitation set out in the immediately preceding
subsection. The right-of-way appeal board by majority vote shall affirm, modify
or reverse an appealed ruling, decision, interpretation or order of the City
Inspector. The appeal board may permit such variance that can be made without
increasing the hazards to the health or safety of persons or property, and when
the granting thereof will not violate the intent and purpose of this chapter.
Mere inconvenience to the appellant is not grounds for the granting of such
variance.
4.Â Â Â Without negating the generality of the foregoing subsections 1 through 3:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any person that is denied registration, denied a right-of-way permit,
that has its right-of-way permit revoked, or that believes that the fees
imposed hereunder are in violation of applicable State law, may request in
writing that such denial, revocation, or fee imposition be reviewed by the
appeal board. The appeal board shall act within sixty (60) days on a timely
written request. A decision by the appeal board affirming the denial,
revocation or fee imposition must be in writing and supported by written
findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Only after both fully availing itself of the review process set forth
in paragraph A above, and upon thereafter receiving formal, written affirmation
by the appeal board of the denial, revocation, or fee imposition for which the
aforementioned review process was requested, the person may do either of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â With the consent of the City, have the matter finally resolved by
binding arbitration. Binding arbitration must be before an arbitrator agreed to
by both the City and the person. If the parties are unable to agree on an
arbitrator, the matter shall be resolved by a three-person arbitration panel
made up of one arbitrator selected by the City, one arbitrator selected by the
person, and one arbitrator selected by the other two arbitrators. The cost and
expense of a single arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the
person. If a three-person arbitration panel is selected, each party shall bear
the expense of its own arbitrator and the parties shall jointly and equally
bear the cost and expense of the third arbitrator, and of the arbitration. Each
party to the arbitration shall pay its own costs, disbursements, and attorney
fees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Bring an action in district court to review a decision of the City
made under this section.
141.26 MAPPING DATA.
1.Â Â Â Before receiving a permit for any proposed excavation, construction,
installation or major repair of any equipment in the right-of-way, the
registrant shall furnish the City Inspector with a detailed map or maps in a
format currently used by the registrant showing the location of all of its
equipment previously installed or constructed within the corporate limits of
the City
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All franchisees shall have six (6) months from the date of passage of
this chapter to supply all mapping data to the City Inspector as required by
Section
141.26(1).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any person that is not required to obtain a franchise from the City
shall have six (6) months from the date of passage of the ordinance codified in
this chapter to supply all mapping data to the City Inspector as required by
Section
141.26(1).
2.Â Â Â Notwithstanding paragraphs A and B above, before receiving a permit for
any proposed excavation, construction, installation, or major repair of any
equipment in the right-of-way, the registrant shall furnish the City Inspector
with a detailed map or maps in the format to be specified by the City for
inclusion in the City mapping system with references to street names, the size
and dimensions of all equipment and proposed equipment, and the distance
beneath the surface of the ground where said equipment or proposed equipment is
or will be located for the entire area located within the corporate limits of
the City of Coralville. Each registrant shall be and remain responsible for
keeping the aforementioned detailed maps of its equipment updated. This
obligation shall include providing the City with an âas-builtâ map upon
completion of work for which a permit is granted as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later that six (6) months after completion of the
work. As the City mapping system shall be comprised in large part of
information provided to it by registrants and other third parties, the City
makes no guarantee of the accuracy of its mapping materials, nor shall the City
be liable for any loss or damage resulting from inaccuracies in the City
mapping system. All registrants shall be responsible for taking due care when
conducting work in the right-of-way.
3.Â Â Â In the case where the City is undertaking a public improvement project and
has excavated in any right-of-way corridor, any person requested in writing by
the City shall update its maps showing the size and dimensions of all equipment
located in said corridor as described in Section
141.26(2) above.
141.27 LOCATION OF EQUIPMENT.
1.Â Â Â Unless otherwise permitted by an existing franchise, State or Federal law,
or unless technologically infeasible given the type or quantity of service
being supplied, the installation of all new equipment and the replacement of
old equipment shall be done underground or contained within buildings or other
structures in conformity with applicable codes unless otherwise agreed to by
the City in writing.
2.Â Â Â The City may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof, as may be determined to be necessary by the City,
for each type of equipment that is or, pursuant to current technology, the City
expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. Excavation,
obstruction, or other permits issued by the City involving the installation or
replacement of equipment may designate the proper corridor for the equipment at
issue and such equipment must be located accordingly.
3.Â Â Â Any registrant whose equipment is located in the right-of-way prior to
enactment of this chapter in a position at variance with the corridors
established by the City shall, no later than at the time of either (i) the next
reconstruction or excavation of its equipment, or (ii) a public improvement
project in the area where its equipment is located, move that equipment to its
assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by
the City for good cause shown.
3.Â Â Â One year after enactment of this chapter, any equipment found in a right-
of-way that has not been registered shall be declared a nuisance. The City may
exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but
limited to, abating the nuisance and restoring the right-of-way to a usable
condition, or taking possession of the equipment and restoring it to a usable
condition. In the event that the person who owns such unregistered equipment is
known to the City, the City shall notify the person of the aforementioned
designation of its equipment as a nuisance and afford the person an opportunity
to either register its equipment with the City in accordance with this chapter,
or abate the nuisance in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances. If this person, after having been
properly notified and given an opportunity to register or abate, fails to do
so, the City may charge the person for the entire cost of abating the nuisance
and restoring the right-of-way should the City elect to remove the equipment
rather than taking possession of same and restoring it to usable condition.
4.Â Â Â To protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public, the City
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
equipment within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate
all of the requests of registrants or persons to occupy and use the right-of-
way. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent reasonably
possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way,
but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the
publicâs need for a particular service, the condition of the right-of-way, the
time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing
equipment in the right-of-way, and future City plans for public improvements
and development projects which have been determined to be in the public
interest.
141.28 RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT.
Upon written notification by the City, the registrant shall promptly and at its
own expense remove and replace, relocate or otherwise adjust its equipment
located in the right-of-way and restore the right-of-way to the same condition
it was in prior to said removal or relocation. The City may make such requests
in order to prevent interference by the registrantâs equipment with:
1.Â Â Â Utilization of the right-of-way by the City for a present or future public
use contemplated to commence within the next twelve (12) months;
2.Â Â Â A public improvement undertaken by the City;
3.Â Â Â An economic development project in which the City has an interest or
investment which is undertaken for purposes of improving or ensuring the public
health, safety or welfare;
4.Â Â Â When the public health, safety or welfare requires it; or
5.Â Â Â When necessary to prevent interference with the safety of ordinary travel
over the right-of-way. In the event that the registrant fails to submit an
acceptable relocation plan and schedule to the City Inspector within a
reasonable period of time after the aforementioned written notice, which in no
event shall exceed sixty (60) days, the City may cause the registrantâs
equipment to be removed or relocated and the registrant shall promptly
reimburse the City for the cost of same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
person shall not be required to remove or relocate its equipment from any
right-of-way which has been vacated in favor of a non-governmental entity
unless and until the reasonable costs thereof are first paid by such non-
governmental entity to the person therefor.
141.29 RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT FEES.
1.Â Â Â Before the issuance of any right-of-way permit in accordance with Section
141.12, each person applying to locate, relocate, or reconstruct any equipment
within the right-of-way shall pay the following fees (if applicable) based upon
the personâs use and activity within the right-of-way:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permit Review Fee. Each person shall pay a non-refundable permit review
fee in an amount to be set by resolution of the City Council to be paid upon
issuance of the right-of-way permit.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Disruption Fee. Each person shall pay a disruption fee to compensate
the City and its citizens for a disruption or disturbance to the Cityâs rights-
of-way. The disruption fee and schedule shall be set by resolution of the City
Council.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Degradation Fee. Each person required to obtain an excavation permit
shall pay a degradation fee to compensate the City for the decrease in the
useful life of the Cityâs right-of-way. The degradation fee shall be calculated
as shown on the schedule to be adopted by resolution of the City Council.
2.Â Â Â In addition to the fees set forth in subsection 1 above, the person shall
also pay all costs attributable to inspection and mapping services rendered by
the City in connection with the personâs right-of-way permit. The inspection
and mapping costs shall be calculated as shown on the schedule adopted by
resolution of the City Council. All inspection and mapping costs are due and
payable within thirty (30) days after invoice by the City.
3.Â Â Â On July 1 of each year, each person shall pay its pro rata share of the
unattributable costs as by law allowed associated with the Cityâs management of
its rights-of-way.
4.Â Â Â Administrative Penalties. The City Inspector shall send notice to any
person who commits a violation of this chapter. Said notice shall state the
date, location and nature of the violation. Each person who violates a
provision of this chapter shall pay the appropriate administrative penalty
according to the schedule adopted by resolution of the City Council. The City
Inspector shall not issue any additional right-of-way permits to that person
until said administrative penalties have been paid in full and the violation
has been corrected.
141.30 DAMAGE TO OTHER EQUIPMENT.
1.Â Â Â When the City performs work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support, or move a registrantâs equipment to protect it, the City
shall notify the registrantâs designated contact person as soon as reasonably
possible, which in no event shall be later than two (2) business days from the
date of the Cityâs efforts to maintain, support or move the registrantâs
equipment. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and
must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Without negating
the foregoing, the City shall use its best efforts to afford the registrant an
opportunity to maintain, support or move its equipment prior to doing so on
behalf of the registrant at the registrantâs expense.
2.Â Â Â Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
equipment in the right-of-way, the location of which has properly been
indicated on a map or maps provided to the City Inspector in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter, which it or its equipment damages. Each
registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
equipment of another registrant caused during the Cityâs response to an
emergency occasioned by that registrantâs equipment.
141.31 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
1.Â Â Â The registrant shall indemnify, defend and hold the City, its officers,
agents and employees, harmless from any and all liability for claims of any
nature (including reimbursement of reasonable legal fees and all costs) arising
directly or indirectly from the exercise of the rights granted herein,
including but not limited to: payments under workerâs compensation laws,
liability as a result of negligence or otherwise; business or service
interruption; damages to any person or property located in the right-of-way at
the registrantâs invitation; or for damages to any person or property resulting
from the equipment, machinery and/or structures or actions of the registrant
(including damages caused by or resulting from the existence of the
registrantâs equipment, machinery and/or structures on the right-of-way). In
the event that any suit or action at law is commenced against the City, upon
any claim for damage arising out of the grant of rights set forth in this
chapter to a registrant, upon being notified in writing by the City of such
action or proceeding, the registrant shall appear and make proper defense
thereto at the sole expense of the registrant; the City shall have the right,
at the Cityâs expense, to participate in the defense of any claim or action
arising directly or indirectly from the exercise of the rights granted herein
to the registrant with counsel of the Cityâs choice, and if any judgment or
decree shall in any such case be rendered against the City therein, the
registrant shall assume, pay and satisfy such judgment or decree, with the cost
thereof.
2.Â Â Â Without negating the generality of the foregoing, the registrant
covenants, represents and warrants that it will not cause or permit the
discharge, release or disposal of any âhazardous materials, substances or
wasteâ (as these terms are defined by applicable State and Federal law, rules
and regulations) in the right-of-way or otherwise contaminate the right-of-way
with any toxic or hazardous materials, substances or waste that would trigger
response or remedial action under any environmental laws or any existing common
law theory based on nuisance or strict liability. If any such representation is
in any manner inaccurate or any such warranty is in any manner breached during
the term of the registrantâs franchise or right-of-way permit period, and if
any such breach gives rise to or results in liability (including but not
limited to, a response action, remedial action or removal action) under any
environmental laws or any existing common law theory based on nuisance or
strict liability, or causes a significant effect on public health, the
registrant shall promptly take any and all remedial and removal action as
required by law to clean up the right-of-way and mitigate exposure to liability
arising therefrom. The covenants, representations and warranties made in this
subsection shall survive and extend beyond the term of the registrantâs
franchise or right-of-way permit.
3.Â Â Â In placing equipment, or allowing it to be placed, in the right-of-way,
the City is not liable for any damages caused thereby to any registrantâs
equipment which is already in place. This chapter is enacted to protect the
general health, welfare and safety of the public at large.
141.32 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE EQUIPMENT.
1.Â Â Â A registrant who has determined to discontinue its operations with respect
to any equipment in any right-of-way, or segment or portion thereof, must
either:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Obtain the City Councilâs approval by resolution of the transfer of the
registrantâs obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way under this
chapter to another person. The aforementioned resolution approving such a
proposed transfer shall not be considered until the registrant has filed with
the City Inspector written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition,
or assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Similarly, the proposed vendee, assignee or
lessee shall file an instrument with the City Inspector, duly executed,
reciting such proposal, accepting the terms of this chapter and franchise, if
applicable, and agreeing to perform all of the conditions thereof and all of
the obligations of the proposed transfer. The aforementioned approval by the
City Council shall not be unreasonably withheld; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Submit to the City a proposal and instruments for transferring
ownership of its equipment to the City. If a registrant proceeds under this
clause, the City may, at its option:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Purchase the equipment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove it; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Require the registrant to post an additional bond or an increased
bond amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably anticipated costs
to be incurred in removing the equipment.
2.Â Â Â Equipment of a registrant which fails to comply with the provisions of
this section and which for two (2) years remains unused shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Abate the nuisance in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Take possession of the equipment and restore it to a usable condition;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require removal of the equipment by the registrant or by the
registrantâs surety; or
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Exercise its rights pursuant to the performance and restoration bond.
Any registrant who has unusable equipment in any right-of-way shall remove it
from that right-of-way during the next scheduled excavation, unless this
requirement is waived by the City.
141.33 ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND MINOR REPAIR.
No excavation or obstruction permit shall be required for the routine
maintenance and minor repair of equipment located in the right-of-way.
Activities constituting âroutine maintenanceâ and âminor repairâ work for
purposes of this chapter shall be restricted exclusively to work conducted on
equipment located aboveground or overhead and as more specifically limited in
the Right-of-way Access Standards Book. Registrants shall be required to
restore the work area for such routine maintenance or minor repair projects to
the same condition that existed before the commencement of such work. Routine
maintenance and minor repair work shall be covered under the performance and
restoration bond required under Section
141.07 of this chapter.
141.34 TRADE SECRETS.
Upon written request from a registrant to the City, any information required to
be submitted by it to the City under this chapter that qualifies as a âtrade
secretâ under Chapter 550 of State Code of Iowa shall be treated as trade

is being issued and address the structure to which it is applicable. All

therein. The rental inspector who believes that there exist grounds for
revocation of the Certificate of Structure Compliance, may petition the City
Council to revoke the Certificate of Structure Compliance. The burden of proof
is on the party seeking the revocation. The owner or operator of the affected
property shall be properly notified of the petition for revocation and shall be
notified of the date, time and place of the City Councilâs consideration of the
petition and may appear and defend. Upon final determination by the City

practicable so that the removal will not leave large holes in the general
outline of the tree. Some crossed or rubbing branches may be cabled apart.
5.Â Â Â All old and new cuts one inch in diameter and over shall be painted with
an approved tree wound dressing. On old wounds, care shall be taken to paint
exposed wood only.
6.Â Â Â Where there is known to be danger of transmitting disease by way of tools,
such tools shall be disinfected with alcohol before using them on another tree.
7.Â Â Â Old scars which are not healing properly, and where callous growths are
not already established, shall be traced and painted, unless some other
treatment is designated.
8.Â Â Â Where practicable, all girdling roots visible to the eye shall be treated

chisel, removing the entire root without injury to the bark or parent stem, or
by reporting such condition to the owner.
9.Â Â Â No topping or dehorning of trees shall be permitted, except by special
written permission of the City Forester. Trees becoming stag headed may have

151.04 CAVITIES AND BRACING.
The following specifications and standards of practice apply to cavity work on
trees in the City:
1.Â Â Â Extensive cavity work should not be performed on a tree unless it is of
sufficiently high value to justify the cost.

1.Â Â Â No alarm system shall be activated by error, mistake, intentional misuse,
or malfunction in any dwelling, building or place when no emergency exists.

154A.05 PENALTIES FOR FALSE ALARMS.
1.Â Â Â Notification. Upon receipt of a false alarm, the Police Department or Fire
Department or the designee of either department shall notify the owner of the
alarm system as shown by the records of the City that the owner has 30 days
upon which to pay the required amount as calculated in subsection 2 of this
section.
2.Â Â Â Service Charge for False Alarms. A service charge shah be made in

Â 
159.01Â Â Â FINDINGS OF FACT.
1.Â Â Â The U.S. EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES")
permit program ("Program") administered by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources ("IDNR") requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System ("MS4")
("MS4 Permit"). The City of Coralville is subject to the Program and is
required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 Permit; the City's MS4 Permit is
on file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection
during regular office hours.
2.Â Â Â As a condition of the City's MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to adopt and
enforce a POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER CONTROL ordinance.
3.Â Â Â No State or Federal funds have been made available to assist the City in
administering and enforcing the Program. Accordingly, the City shall fund its
operations under this chapter entirely by charges imposed on the owners or
developers of properties which are made subject to the Program by virtue of
State and Federal law, and/or other sources of funding established by a
separate ordinance.
4.Â Â Â Land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the
hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates
and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and
deposition; this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants; and stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and non-point
source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of
stormwater runoff from development sites.
5.Â Â Â Therefore, the City of Coralville establishes this set of City stormwater
requirements to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater
runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It
is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land
development and other construction activities in order to control and minimize
increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel
erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in
the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
6.Â Â Â The "Iowa Stormwater Management Manual" published collaboratively by the
Iowa Department of Natural Resources and The Center for Transportation Research
and Education at Iowa State University establishes guidelines consisting of
unified sizing criteria, stormwater management designs and specifications and
BMPs. City hereby finds and declares that the guidelines provided for in the
Iowa Stormwater Management Manual, and in future editions thereof, should be
and are hereby adopted as the stormwater management standards of the City. Any
BMP installation that complies with the provisions of the Iowa Stormwater
Management Manual, or future editions thereof, at the time of installation
shall be deemed to have been installed in accordance with this ordinance.
159.02Â Â Â PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to adopt as the City's standards and sizing
criteria and BMPs to address said standards the Guidelines, Sizing Criteria,
and BMPs proposed by the Iowa Stormwater Management Manual and as specifically
identified above (hereinafter collectively "City stormwater requirements") in
order to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the
public within this jurisdiction. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose
through the following objectives:
1.Â Â Â Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from development within the City
limits and fringe area in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in
stream temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
2.Â Â Â Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
3.Â Â Â Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from
any specific development project site after completion to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
4.Â Â Â Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and non-point
source pollution, wherever possible, through establishment of appropriate
minimum stormwater management standards and BMPs and to ensure that BMPs are
properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.
159.03Â Â Â APPLICABILITY.
1.Â Â Â This chapter is applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications
meeting the minimum square foot applicability criteria of item 2 of this
section, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the City under
Section 159.07 of this chapter. This chapter also applies to land disturbance
activities that are smaller than the minimum square foot applicability criteria
specified in subsection 2 if such activities are part of a larger common plan
of development that meets the minimum square foot applicability criteria
specified in subsection 2, even though multiple separate and distinct land
development activities may take place at different times on different
schedules. In addition, all plans must also be reviewed by Coralville
Engineering Department officials to ensure that established water quality
standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that
post-construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional
watershed plans.
2.Â Â Â City stormwater requirements must be met for development to be approved.
City stormwater requirements apply to any development disturbing one acre or
more of land, and to any development disturbing less than one acre if the
amount of impervious cover created or recreated exceeds 5,000 square feet. The
following activities are exempt from this chapter:

Site Design involves techniques applied early in the design process to preserve
natural areas, reduce impervious cover, distribute runoff and use pervious
areas to more effectively treat stormwater runoff. Site design should address
open space protection, impervious cover minimization, and runoff distribution
and minimization, and runoff utilization through considerations such as:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Open space protection and restoration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Conservation of existing natural areas (upland and wetland)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Reforestation
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Re-establishment of prairies

sidewalk width
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Reduce impervious surface footprint (e.g. two story buildings,
parking ramp)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Distribution and minimization of runoff.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Utilize vegetated areas for stormwater treatment (e.g. parking lot
islands, vegetated areas along property boundaries, front and rear yards,
building landscaping)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Direct impervious surface runoff to vegetated areas or to designed
treatment areas (roofs, parking, driveways drain to pervious areas, not
directly to stormsewer or other conveyances)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Encourage infiltration and soil storage of runoff through grass
channels, soil compost amendment, vegetated swales, raingardens, etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Plant vegetation that does not require irrigation beyond natural
rainfall and runoff from the site
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Runoff utilization.

159.07Â Â Â WAIVERS.
Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this
chapter, unless a written request is filed to waive implementation of BMPs, in
whole or in part, and such waiver is granted. Requests to waive implementation
of BMPs in whole or in part shall be submitted to City for approval.
1.Â Â Â A waiver of BMPs required by this chapter may be granted provided that at
least one of the following conditions is established by applicant based on
authoritative written evidence satisfactory to City:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the
objectives of this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater
have been established in a stormwater management final plan that has been
approved by City and fully implemented.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility within
the same watershed. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be
designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices, and
there is, in the City's sole judgment, a responsible entity legally obligated
to monitor the performance of and maintain the efficiency of stormwater BMPs in
accordance with a written and recorded maintenance agreement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In instances where one of the above conditions is established, the
applicant must further establish by authoritative written evidence satisfactory
to City that the partial waiver will not result in any of the following impacts
to downstream waterways:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Degradation of biological functions or habitat; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
2.Â Â Â If the City finds that a waiver is appropriate because implementation of
no on-site stormwater BMPs is not feasible due to the natural or existing
physical characteristics of a site, or that one of the conditions specified in
subsection 1 above cannot be established to a certainty, or that any one or
more of the impacts to downstream waterways specified above cannot be entirely
averted, the applicant shall execute a binding written agreement to accomplish
one or more of the following mitigation measures selected by City:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an
easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reconstruction of native
ecosystems of lands strategically located in the watershed consistent with the
purposes of this chapter, of a sufficient quantity to enable City or others to
achieve City stormwater requirements with respect to a number of cubic feet of
annual stormwater equivalent to the estimated number of cubic feet of annual
stormwater that will not achieve City stormwater requirements as a consequence
of the waiver.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The creation of one or more stormwater BMPs on previously developed
properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater BMPs, having a
capacity to achieve City stormwater requirements with respect to a number of
cubic feet of annual stormwater equivalent to the estimated number of cubic
feet of annual stormwater that will not achieve City stormwater requirements as
a consequence of the waiver.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Monetary contributions (fee in lieu) to fund stormwater management
activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates,
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies, monitoring of stormwater BMPs, and stream corridor stabilization
practices). The monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule (unless the developer and the stormwater authority agree on a
greater alternate contribution) established by City, based on the estimated
cost savings to the developer resulting from the waiver and the estimated
future costs to City to achieve City stormwater requirements with respect to a
number of cubic feet of annual stormwater equivalent to the estimated number of
cubic feet of annual stormwater that will not achieve City stormwater
requirements as a consequence of the waiver. All of the monetary contributions
shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and
shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any building permit for
the development.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Dedication of land or granting of an easement by the applicant of a
value equivalent to the cost to City of the construction of an off-site
stormwater management facility sufficient to achieve City stormwater
requirements with respect to a number of cubic feet of annual stormwater
equivalent to the estimated number of cubic feet of annual stormwater that will
not achieve City stormwater requirements as a consequence of the waiver. The
agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and City prior to the
recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of
the building permit.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Factors that may generate waivers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Shallow Bedrock
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â High Groundwater
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Hotspots or contaminated soils
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Single family residential or duplex lots that were final platted
prior to April 22, 2014.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â City owned construction that was designed prior to April 22, 2014.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Excessive Cost. If practice cost is greater than an amount as set
by resolution of the City Council per impervious acre, a waiver will be granted
for the excess cost above the amount set by the resolution.

marked with wood lathe or flags.
4.Â Â Â After construction is completed, applicants are required to submit actual
"as-built" drawings satisfactory to City for any stormwater BMPs located on
site. The drawings must show the final design specifications for all stormwater
BMPs and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by
City is required before the release of the installation performance security or
bond can occur.
5.Â Â Â Landscaping and stabilization shall be accomplished to prevent violation
of City stormwater requirements or impairment of BMPs. In addition, a
landscaping plan must be submitted with the final as-built drawings describing
the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site
after construction is completed. This plan will explain not only how the site

development involving any stormwater BMP, the applicant or owner of the site
must execute a maintenance and repair easement agreement that shall be binding
on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater BMP. The agreement
shall provide for access to the BMP and the land it serves at reasonable times
for periodic inspection by City or City's designee and for regular or special
assessments of property owners to ensure that the BMP is maintained in proper
working condition to meet City stormwater requirements. The easement agreement
shall be recorded by City at the expense of the permit holder or property
owners.
2.Â Â Â Maintenance Covenants.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Maintenance of all stormwater BMPs shall be ensured through the
creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the City and
recorded prior to the stormwater management final plan approval. As part of the
covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will
occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater BMPs. The covenant shall also
include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the BMPs
between scheduled cleanouts.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The City, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may at its discretion,
accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater BMP to include City
responsibility for maintenance and repair, provided that: the maintenance and
repair of such element will not impose an undue burden on other City taxpayers
who enjoy little if any benefit from the BMP; the BMP meets all the
requirements of this chapter; and the dedication includes adequate and
perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection
and regular maintenance.
3.Â Â Â Requirements for Maintenance Covenants. All stormwater BMPs must undergo,
at the minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs
and ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and accomplishment
of its purposes. These needs may include (but are not limited to) removal of
silt, litter, and other debris from all stormwater treatment and conveyance
facilities including ponds, infiltration basins, raingardens, catch basins,
inlets, and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary
replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance or repair needs detected
must be corrected by the developer or entity responsible under a written
maintenance agreement within 30 days, as determined by City, and the inspection
and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure
proper functioning of the stormwater BMPs.
4.Â Â Â Inspection of Stormwater BMPs. Inspection programs may be established on
any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random
inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible
violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than
typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of
businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges
of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more
likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of State or Federal water
or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit; and joint
inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws.
Inspections may include but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and
repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material
or water in stormwater BMPs, and evaluating the condition of stormwater BMPs.
5.Â Â Â Right of Entry for Inspection. When any new stormwater BMP is installed on
private property, or when any new connection is made between private property
and a public stormwater management facility, sanitary sewer or combined sewer,
the property owner shall grant to City the right to enter the property at
reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This
includes the right to enter a property when City has a reasonable basis to
believe that a violation of this chapter is occurring or has occurred, and to
enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a
violation of this chapter.
6.Â Â Â Records of Installation and Maintenance and Repair Activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of stormwater BMPs shall submit
to the City Engineer an annual maintenance and inspection report including all
records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs conducted. At
the completion of the 5th year, an updated as built drawing will be required.
The responsible parties shall retain the records for at least five (5) years or
longer if the City Inspector deems it necessary. These records shall be made
available to City during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable
times upon request.
7.Â Â Â Failure to Maintain Stormwater BMPs. If a responsible party fails or
refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant or any provision
of this chapter, the City, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation by
performing all necessary work to place the BMP in proper working condition. In
the event that the stormwater BMP becomes a danger to public safety or public
health, the City shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the
stormwater BMP in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person
shall have thirty (30) days to effect maintenance and repair of the stormwater
BMP in an approved manner. After proper notice, the City may assess, jointly
and severally, the owners of the stormwater BMP or the property owners or the
parties responsible for maintenance under any applicable written agreement for
the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a
lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property,
and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes.
159.15Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
1.Â Â Â Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action
including an action for injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement action,

demographic and environmental criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for
the discharge of stormwater from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)
Permit. The City of Coralville is subject to the NPDES permit program and is
required to obtain, an MS4 permit; the City's MS4 permit can be found on-line
at https: Coralville.org/stormwater.
2.Â Â Â The Program requires certain individuals engaged in construction
activities apply to the Department for a State NPDES General Permit No. 2.
Notwithstanding any provision of this ordinance, every Applicant(s) bears final
and complete responsibility for compliance with a State NPDES General Permit
No. 2 and a City Construction Site Runoff Permit, and any other requirement of
state or federal law or administrative rule.
3.Â Â Â As a condition of the City's MS4 permit, the City is obliged to undertake
responsibility for administration and enforcement of the Program by adopting a
Construction Site Erosion and Sediment Control ordinance designed to achieve
the following objectives:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any Person required by law or administrative rule to apply to the
Department for a State NPDES General Permit No. 2 shall also be required to
obtain from the City a Construction Site Runoff Permit in addition to and not
in lieu of the State NPDES General Permit No. 2; and
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The City shall have responsibility for inspection, monitoring and
enforcement procedures to promote Applicant's compliance with State NPDES
General Permit No. 2 and City Construction Site Runoff Permits.
4.Â Â Â No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the City in

160.01 PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing flood losses with provisions designed to:
1.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
2.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
3.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
4.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended
purposes because of flood hazard.
5.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community
to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.

Administrator, who shall forward such to the Board of Adjustment for
consideration. Such requests shall include information ordinarily submitted
with applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the
Board of Adjustment.
2.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The
notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
3.Â Â Â Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship.
Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration
of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the

Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii)
such construction increases risks to life and property.

between each of these is expressed as a ratio. The floor area ratio (FAR)
determines the maximum floor area for all buildings on the lot. The open space
ratio (OSR) determines the minimum amount of land area which shall not be
enclosed by buildings. The living space ratio (LSR) determines the minimum
amount of lot area to be used for people, planting and visual appeal. The
recreation space ratio (RSR) determines the minimum amount of area to be
developed for active and passive recreation. When (LA) is land area and (FA) is
floor area, the ratios can be defined as follows:
FAR x LA = maximum floor area (FA)
OSR x FA = minimum open space (OS)
LSR x FA = minimum exterior living space (LS)
RSR x FA = minimum recreation space (RS)
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Floor Area (FA) Method of Computation: For the purpose of determining
the floor area ratio, the âfloor areaâ of a building is the sum of the gross
horizontal area of the several floors of the building measured from the
exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating
two (2) buildings. The floor area of a building shall include basement floor
area, elevator shafts and stairwells at each floor penthouse, attic space
having headroom of seven (7) feet or more, interior balconies and mezzanines,
enclosed porches and floor area devoted to accessory uses. However, any space
devoted to mechanical equipment, parking or loading shall not be included in
the floor area. The floor area for enclosed space having a floor to ceiling
height in excess of twenty (20) feet shall be computed on the basis that each
fifteen (15) feet of height shall be equal to one floor for the purpose of
computation. Space intended for recreational use in apartment buildings may be
excluded from these calculations if the Zoning Administrator finds that said
recreational uses are suitable for the size and use of the proposed structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Land Area (LA) Method of Computation. The land area is the area of the
lot; plus one-half (Â½) of the area of the abutting public street and public
alley rights of way where the lot has vehicular access rights; plus an area
computed by multiplying ten (10) times the linear feet of frontage along any
abutting beneficial open space to the residential use; including area of
rivers, lakes, public parks and grounds around public buildings.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Open Space (OS) Method of Computation. The open space area is the land
area less the total ground area covered by buildings, plus one-half (Â½) of all
exterior space which is open on its sides to weather, but not open to the sky
(carports, exterior balconies); plus all roof areas which have been suitably
improved for use by occupants.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Living Space (LS) Method of Computation. The living space is the land
area less the total ground area covered by buildings; plus one half (Â½) the
total area of all covered open spaces at ground level not used for autos; less
all uncovered auto area; plus all roof areas which have been suitably improved
for all weather use by occupants; plus off-site permanent recreation space
eligible for recreation space requirements.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Recreation Space (RS) Method of Computation. The recreation space is
the total area devoted to active and passing recreation. If the required
recreation space is more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet all of it shall
be located in a contiguous portion of the lot and no dimension may be less than
twenty five (25) feet. If the required recreation space is more than ten
thousand (10,000) square feet each separate recreation area shall contain not
less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet and no portion of the space shall
be less than fifty (50) feet in width. Off-site permanent recreation space and
facilities may be approved as meeting up to one-half (Â½) the recreation space
requirements if it meets the intent of these regulations and it abuts the site.

All lots shall abut a public street or duly approved private street and each

Where one parcel of property is divided into two (2) or more portions by reason
of different zoning districts, each portion shall be used independently of the
other in its respective zoning classification provided it meets the minimum lot
size. For purposes of applying the regulations of this chapter, each portion
shall be considered as if in separate and different ownership. Where a portion
of the property is zoned a district and does not have sufficient land area to

chapter, and it was a legal lot under the provisions of the Cityâs zoning
chapter at the time it was created, it shall be considered a conforming lot
under this chapter, provided that any structure erected upon it shall comply
with the setback requirements of this chapter. If the setback requirements are
so prohibitive as to make the property unusable, an application for a variance
to the provisions of this chapter should be sought; however approval may be
granted only as provided in Section
165.54 of this chapter.

All corner lots must meet front yard requirements on all yards abutting public
street right-of-way. Any lot that is separated from public street right-of-way
by a portion of an adjacent lot or a parcel that is neither a lot nor a
nonconforming lot under this chapter and, but for this separation would be a
corner lot, must also meet front yard requirements on all yards abutting public
street right-of-way and all yards that otherwise would be abutting public
street right-of-way but for separation by such nonconforming lot.

165.33 PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
The Planned Unit Development One District and the Planned Unit Development Two
District are intended to provide flexibility in the design of planned projects;
to encourage innovation in project design that incorporates open space and
other amenities; and to insure the compatibility of developments with the
surrounding urban environment. The Planned Unit Development Districts (One and
Two) are intended to promote developments which will be advantageous to the
City and its urban form by permitting project design that will surpass the
quality of development resulting from a strict application of the regulations
of conventional zoning districts. Consequently, the Planned Unit Development
Districts are to be used to exceed the Cityâs traditional zoning and
subdivision requirements and not to circumvent these standards. The Planned
Unit Development Districts shall not be used to secure approval for projects
that do not conform to the Cityâs comprehensive plan.

intended to accommodate projects for which the specific design of individual
buildings and elements may be determined. Several PUD-2 Districts may be
incorporated into a single larger PUD-1 District, provided that such projects
are consistent with the overall design and development elements reviewed and
approved as part of the PUD-1 District boundary amendment petition process,
specifically including criterion approved as part of the pre-petition concept
plan.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â While the stated purpose of the PUD-1 District zoning designation is to
accommodate large, long-term, comprehensive development, this objective should
not be interpreted to require that all persons interested in designing a
Planned Unit Development to first obtain a PUD-1 District zoning classification
before petitioning for a PUD-2 District zoning designation. Occasionally, a
developer will approach the City with both an overall, long-term development
scheme and detailed proposed design plans for a specific project or projects.
In this instance, the developer may opt to petition for a PUD-2 District zoning
designation at the start of the formal development process with the City in
lieu of an interim PUD-1 District zoning classification.
2.Â Â Â Location Criteria. The Planned Unit Development Districts are generally
intended for use in the following three urban contexts:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Vacant Land. Areas of substantial open space, where the structure of
conventional zoning may artificially limit or constrain good urban design, may
restrict the achievement of the Cityâs development objectives, or may not be
appropriate to changes in technology or demand consistent with the best
interests of the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Community Development Areas. Areas of the City which are in need of
rehabilitation or redevelopment, including areas which may be deficient in
public facilities or services. In these situations, the PUD District may
encourage private investment by recognizing the need for flexibility that
conventional zoning regulations do not provide.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Neighborhood Contexts. Areas in which sensitive project design is
critical to maintain and protect the value of surrounding residential
neighborhoods and other sensitive or vulnerable urban settings.
3.Â Â Â Permitted Land Uses. In addition to being classified as either a Planned
Unit Development One District or a Planned Unit Development Two District,
Planned Unit Development Districts may include residential, office, commercial,
industrial or public land uses, subject to the following restrictions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A Residential Planned Unit Development (One or Two) shall be located in
an area designated for residential uses in the Cityâs comprehensive plan and
shall have 100% of its total land area in residential, public, open space and
accessory uses, such as parking to serve residential or public uses. Permitted
residential uses include dwelling units in detached, semi-detached, attached,
clustered or multi-story structures, or any combination thereof.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A Commercial Planned Unit Development (One or Two) shall be located in
an area designated for commercial or mixed uses in the Cityâs comprehensive
plan and may contain, alone or in combination, the following use types:
residential, office, commercial, public, open space and accessory uses, such as
parking to serve such primary uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An Industrial Planned Unit Development (One or Two) shall be located in
an area designated for industrial uses in the Cityâs comprehensive plan and may
contain, alone or in combination, the following use types: industrial, office,
commercial, public, open space and accessory uses, such as parking to serve
such primary uses. Such a Planned Unit Development shall not include
residential land uses.
4.Â Â Â PUD-A and PUD-B Site Development Plans.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The PUD-A Site Development Plan is intended to facilitate the
structured growth of large, long-term comprehensive developments within PUD-
1 Districts. Accordingly, the PUD-A Site Development Plan guidelines and
regulations ensure that development over time conforms to an established master
plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The PUD-B Site Development Plan is intended to facilitate the
development of projects for which the specific design of individual buildings
and elements may be determined. This level of detailed planning may be reached
either: (i) at or near the time that a PUD-2 District boundary amendment is
sought; or (ii) once the overall development of a project has progressed to the
point that detailed design elements are available for a proposed Planned Unit
Development within an existing PUD-1 District.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â While approval of a PUD-B Site Development Plan is often sought in
connection with a PUD-2 District boundary amendment, nothing in this Section
165.33 shall be interpreted to prohibit an applicant from seeking approval of a
PUD-B Site Development Plan for a proposed Planned Unit Development to be
located within a PUD-1 District (or a portion thereof). Consequently, several
PUD-B Site Development Plans may be approved for implementation within a single
PUD-1 District, provided that such projects are consistent with the overall
design and development standards of the PUD-1 District, specifically including
criterion approved as part of the pre-petition concept plan. PUD-A Site
Development Plans may only be approved in connection with a PUD-1 District.
5.Â Â Â The PUD-1 District Requirements and Application Procedures:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minimum Size. The minimum size of a PUD-1 District shall be three (3)
acres.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Pre-petition Concept Plan. Prior to filing a formal district boundary
amendment petition in accordance with the requirements of Section
165.60 of this Code, the petitioner shall meet with the Zoning Administrator
for the purpose of submitting a pre-petition concept plan. This plan shall
illustrate the conceptual overall plan for the District and shall include at a
minimum the information required in Table One.â  25 Â 
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â PUD-1 District Petition Fee. This fee shall be established by
resolution of the Council and shall be in lieu of payment of the application
fee required under Section
165.60(8) of this chapter.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Zoning Administrator Review. The Zoning Administrator shall review and
comment on the proposed concept plan and shall provide the petitioner with
written comments within thirty (30) days of submission of the proposed concept
plan. At the option of the petitioner or the Zoning Administrator, the final
concept plan may be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Council for review and comment at the earliest practical meeting.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Pre-petition Concept Plan Review Criteria. The review of the pre-
petition concept plan shall include consideration of the following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Land use intensity and density.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Ability to provide a positive environment for intended uses,
including schematic building configurations and arrangements (if available) and
general landscaping and site design.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use of open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Impact on the surrounding natural and built environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Adequacy of on- and off-site transportation and utility systems to
serve the proposed project.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Consistency with the Cityâs comprehensive plan.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Following review and approval of the PUD-1 District pre-petition
concept plan, the petitioner may proceed to file a formal district boundary
amendment petition in accordance with Section
165.60 of this chapter. The Council, on its own motion or petition, may cause a
PUD-1 District boundary amendment to be made in accordance with the
requirements of Section
165.59 of this chapter. All district boundary amendment petitions submitted
under this paragraph shall be approved by ordinance after the public hearing
requirements of Section
165.58 of this chapter have been satisfied.
6.Â Â Â PUD-A Site Development Plan.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The PUD-A Site Development Plan Requirements and Application
Procedures. Following review and approval of the PUD-1 District boundary
amendment petition, or concurrently with this review and approval process, the
property owner or any designated agent may proceed with the filing of a formal
PUD-A Site Development Plan which shall illustrate the development master plan
for the underlying PUD-1 District and shall include, at a minimum, the
information required under both Table One (
Appendix Pages 14 and 15 of this Code of Ordinances) and Section
165.52 of this Code.

165.35 PARKING AND TRAFFIC STANDARDS.
The parking and traffic standards of this chapter are set forth to insure to
the maximum extent possible vehicle movement and parking needs are satisfied in
a safe, efficient manner. The purpose of off-street parking standards is to
substantially alleviate the parking of vehicles on traveled roadways and to
provide adequate, safe and visually acceptable parking on private property.
1.Â Â Â Access. Access to private property from public right-of-ways may be
limited to insure the safe and efficient movement of vehicles. All newly
constructed or improved accesses shall conform to access standards set forth by
the City Engineer; including location, spacing, numbers, size and type of
driveway construction. In addition to the access standards set by the City
Engineer the following minimum requirements shall be met:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minimum Distance of Access From Street Intersection - 25 feet (measured
along right-of-way lines)

railroad right-of-way, and also at the point where an access drive to a parking
area for more than four vehicles intersects with a public street or alley
right-of-way. The Traffic Visibility Zone is measured 25 feet both directions
from the point of intersection along the intersecting right-of-ways or access
drive to two points that are connected diagonally. The Traffic Visibility Zone

Projects not adhering to these guidelines may be considered through a PUD
Zoning and Site Development Plan. Each project will be considered based on its
merit, urban environment and form.
7.Â Â Â Administrative Action. The Zoning Administrator must act upon each
complete application within 30 calendar days. An applicant may appeal a denial

limited to, additional landscaping or screening; installation of erosion
control measures; improvement of access or circulation; rearrangement of
structures on the site; or other modifications deemed necessary to protect the
public health, welfare, or character of the community.
10.Â Â Â Term and Modification of Approval.

approval, unless the applicant receives a Building Permit and diligently
carries out development prior to the expiration of this period.

owner demonstrates that all of the following elements are present:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Not contrary to the public interest:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The proposed variance will not threaten neighborhood integrity or
have a substantially adverse affect on the use or value of other properties in
the area adjacent to the property included in the variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The proposed variance will be in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of this chapter, and will not contravene the objectives of the
Community Plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Unnecessary hardship:

165.55A FRONT YARD SETBACK ADJUSTMENT.Â Â 
Front yard setback adjustments are limited to principle structures in the
Cityâs R-1, R-1(B) and R-2 residential zoning districts. The purpose of the
front yard setback adjustments is to encourage reinvestment and infill housing,
and to maintain property values in the city's residential neighborhoods. The
required front yard setback may be adjusted by the Community Development
Director as follows:
1.Â Â Â Interior Lots: Where dwellings exist on both abutting lots and both have
setback less than required by the underlying zoning district, the setback for
the interior lot need not exceed the average of the setbacks of the two (2)
abutting dwellings. Where dwellings exist on both abutting lots and only one
has a setback less than required by the underlying zoning district, the setback
for the interior lot need not exceed the average of the required setback and
the smaller setback.
2.Â Â Â Corner Lots: Where a dwelling exists on an abutting lot and has a setback
less than required by the underlying zoning district, the setback for the
corner lot need not exceed the setback of the abutting lot on the same street
frontage, provided the required visibility triangle is maintained.
3.Â Â Â In no event shall any structure extend beyond the front property line of a
lot.
(Ord. 2022-1010 â Mar. 23)
165.56 EFFECT OF APPEAL.
An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
including, without limitation of the foregoing, a permitteeâs right to proceed
with development or other activities authorized under a zoning permit, the
issuance of which is subject of the appeal, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of the appeal shall have been
filed with the Zoning Administrator that by reasons of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would in their opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings or development shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of
Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the City Clerk
for due cause shown.
165.57 ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS.
The applicant for any permits required under this chapter or the applicant for
any amendments or variances to this chapter shall only be the fee title holder
to the subject property, except as otherwise specified in this chapter.

provided of their authority to make such application. Where the property is
owned by more than one person, entity or corporation, evidence shall be
provided of the applicantâs authority to make application on behalf of the
other property owners. Where the property is owned by a corporation, evidence
of the authority of the executing corporate officer shall be provided. In no
circumstances shall third parties, such as engineers, architects, realtors,
brokers, lenders or others without interest in title to the subject property be
eligible applicants. Options to purchase, contracts to purchase or other
similar relationships are not sufficient to transfer applicant eligibility to a
party other than the property owner. It is the intent of this provision to
insure that applicants under this chapter are limited to property owners.

of a public hearing a copy of the public hearing notice and an explanation of
their rights to be heard and/or protest the proposed action. Failure of
property owners to receive this notice shall not invalidate any subsequent
action of the City.

amend, supplement, change, modify or repeal by chapter the boundaries of
districts, or regulations or restrictions herein established. Any proposed

to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its report and recommendation. The
Commission shall hold a public hearing as provided in Section
165.58 on the proposed amendment and make a report and recommendation to the
Council within forty-five (45) days of the public hearing. Failure to act
within 45 days shall constitute a recommendation of denial. Within thirty (30)
days of receipt of the Commissionâs recommendation, the Council shall hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment. The Council shall act on the proposed
amendment within 45 days of the public hearing. The City may take an additional
45 days to implement required multiple readings of the chapter and required
publication. Failure to enact an amendment within ninety (90) days shall
constitute denial of the amendment. Reconsideration of the amendment, after
denial, is processed as if it were newly initiated; following the same
procedures before the Commission and Council.

material relating to the proposed subdivision in order to make use of the
advice and assistance of the Commission. This may include information relative
to the site and conditions of the site, existing community facilities and
utilities on and adjacent to the site, number and size of lots proposed, etc.
It is suggested that for the maximum benefit the material should include as a
minimum:
1.Â Â Â Location Map. Sketch map showing relationship of the proposed subdivision
to the streets and other community facilities serving it.
2.Â Â Â Sketch Plan. The sketch plan should show in simple sketch form proposed
layout of streets, lots and other features in relation to existing conditions.
The sketch plan discussion does not require formal application, fee or the
filing of the plat. The subdivider may by appointment through the Clerkâs
office present the sketch plan directly to the City Engineer and the Building
Official, separately or together, for their comments and suggestions, receiving
their opinions and advice on technical matters as related to the proposed
subdivision. Thereafter, the applicant may present the sketch plan directly to
the Commission for their comments and suggestions. It is the intent at the
sketch plan stage to inform the developer of the basic requirements set forth
in this chapter and to determine whether or not the basic proposed subdivision
meets with the Commissionâs favor.
170.04 PRELIMINARY PLAT - PREPARATION AND FILING.
The subdivider or any owner of any tract or parcel of land within the corporate
limits of the City or within two (2) miles adjacent thereto shall cause to be

unless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by the subdivider and the
Commission.
3.Â Â Â The Council, at the Council meeting immediately following the Planning and
Zoning Commission action, shall approve or reject the preliminary plat
considering comments received.
170.06 PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL NOT TO CONSTITUTE SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
Approval of the preliminary plat by the Council does not constitute approval of
the subdivision but is merely an authorization to proceed with the preparation
of the final plat. In the event the preliminary plat is approved and the final
plat does not deviate from the preliminary plat plans and specifications and
construction indicates improvements required by the City have been met or that
satisfactory arrangements or escrow agreements have been made to assure
construction of such improvements, then the final plat must be approved unless
both the City and owner waive this agreement in writing.
170.07 TIME LIMITATION OF PRELIMINARY APPROVAL.
Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of eighteen
(18) months unless upon written request of the subdivider the Council by
resolution grants an extension of time. If the final plat is not filed with the
Clerk within eighteen (18) months of the preliminary plat, all previous actions
of the Council with respect to the plat shall be null and void. If the final
plat is filed within eighteen (18) months of the preliminary plat and the final
plat does not include all of the area of the preliminary plat, then all
previous actions of the Council may not be null and void with respect to the
balance of the area in the preliminary plat.
170.08 FINAL PLAT â PREPARATION AND FILING.
Following approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall cause to be
prepared a final plat and other material required in filing for final approval.
Preliminary and final plats may be filed and processed together only when
dividing one lot into two lots, when resubdividing existing lots where public
improvements are already installed or if a Johnson County Subdivision.
Application for final plat approval shall consist of filing with the Clerk
eleven (11) copies if a City plat or twelve (12) copies if a County plat, and
the following additional information:
1.Â Â Â Final Plat. A final plat of the subdivision drawn in a scale of one inch

naming of said streets or avenues, which shall be accomplished prior to
preparation of the final plat.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Curve notes. Complete and accurate for all street curves included in
the plat.

developed, whichever shall occur first, and when pertaining to street light
improvement installations, they shall be made when so directed by the Council.
A certified or cashierâs check may be provided in lieu of the above bond or
escrow arrangement.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â In the event the proposed subdivision is located outside the City

to Council approval, comply with the bond and/or escrow requirements for all or
any part of the public improvement requirements set forth in paragraphs F and G
above by executing contract or petition and waiver therefor. Said contract or
petition and waiver shall provide for the total project cost of the
installation of said public improvements to be paid by special assessment
levied against the lots in the subdivision with said special assessments not

APPENDIX
USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â OFFICIAL COPY. The âOFFICIAL COPYâ of the Code of Ordinances must be
kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the âOFFICIAL COPY.â
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â DISTRIBUTION. Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made
available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to
have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference
centers such as the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â SALE. The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not
recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to
result in outdated codes being used or misused.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION. The City Clerk should be responsible for
maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of the Code
of Ordinances. Each official, elected or appointed, should return to the City,
upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pertaining to
the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances;
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
