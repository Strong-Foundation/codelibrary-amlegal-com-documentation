authorized to enforce the Code of Ordinances of the City of Cascade.
      c.   Repeat offense. The term "repeat offense" shall mean a recurring
violation of the same section of the Code of Ordinances.

(Ord 14-16 7-25-16)
      b.   Each day that a violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the
violator constitutes a separate offense.
      c.   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this chapter does not
preclude the City from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same
action.
   3.   Civil Citations
      a.   Any officer authorized by the City to enforce the Code of Ordinances
may issue a civil citation to a person who commits a municipal infraction.

shall be punishable by a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each day a violation exists or continues.
   B.   A municipal infraction classified as an environmental violation shall
be punishable by a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
for each occurrence. However, an environmental violation shall not be subject
to such penalty if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      1.   The violation results solely from conducting an initial startup,
cleaning, repairing, performing scheduled maintenance, testing, or conducting a
shutdown of either equipment causing the violation or the equipment designed to
reduce or eliminate the violation.

      3.   The violation does not continue in existence for more than eight (8)

in the same action. Such relief may include the imposition of a civil penalty
by entry of a personal judgment against the defendant, directing that the
payment of the civil penalty be suspended or deferred under conditions imposed
by the court, ordering the defendant to abate or cease the violation or
authorizing the City to abate or correct the violation, or ordering that the
City’s cost for abatement or correction of the violation be entered as a
personal judgment against the defendant or assessed against the property where
the violation occurred, or both. If a defendant willfully violates the terms of
an order imposed by the court, the failure is contempt.
      5.   This section does not preclude a peace officer from issuing a
criminal citation for violation of a City Code or regulation if criminal
penalties are also provided for the violation, nor does it preclude or limit
the authority of the City to enforce the provisions of the Code of Ordinances
by criminal sanctions or other lawful means. Each day that a violation occurs
or is permitted to exist by the defendant constitutes a separate offense. The
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances or any regulation
promulgated thereunder shall also constitute a simple misdemeanor punishable by
a fine of $100.00.
(ECIA Model Code Amended in 2017)
1-3-3   SCHEDULED FINES.
The scheduled fine for a violation of any provision of the City Code shall be
in accordance with State Code Chapter 805 unless another scheduled amount is
provided in the City Code or Iowa Code.

3-15-7   Liability
3-15-1   PURPOSE.
In order to reduce the danger to the public health, safety and welfare from the
leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated to
establish responsibility for the treatment, removal and cleanup of hazardous
substance spills within the City limits.
3-15-2   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance
onto the land, into a water of the State or into the atmosphere which creates
an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])
   3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of substances that
presents a danger to the public health or safety and includes, but is not
limited to, a substance that is toxic, corrosive, or flammable, or that is an
irritant or that generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other
means. “Hazardous substance” may include any hazardous waste identified or
listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under
section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended to January 1,
1977, or any hazardous substance designated under Section 311 of the Federal

operating under a lease, contract, or other agreement with the legal owner of
the hazardous substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
3-15-3   CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,
spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the hazardous
substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the environment
or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable notice, based
on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within thirty (30) days, the City Attorney shall
proceed to obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is
beyond the capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall
report to the Council and immediately seek any State or Federal funds available
for said cleanup.
3-15-4   LIABILITY FOR CLEANUP COSTS.
The responsible person shall be strictly liable to the City for all of the

area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the person.
   3.   The reasonable damages to the City for the injury to, destruction of,
or loss of City property, including parks and roads, resulting from a hazardous
condition caused by that person, including the costs of assessing the injury,
destruction or loss.

possible but not later than six (6) hours after the onset of the hazardous
condition or discovery of the hazardous condition. The Police Chief shall
immediately notify the Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Any other person who discovers a hazardous condition shall notify the
Police Chief, which shall then notify the Department of Natural Resources.
3-15-6   POLICE AUTHORITY.

CHAPTER 16
SNOW REMOVAL
3-16-1   Purpose
3-16-2   Snow Emergency Declaration
3-16-3   Snow Removal Routes
3-16-4   Driveways & Snow from Private Property
3-16-5   Removal of Snow & Ice from Sidewalks
3-16-6   Vehicle Parking During a Snow Emergency
3-16-1   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Chapter is to establish and maintain uniform definitions
and procedures concerning snow and ice removal for the City of Cascade. The
City will provide snow and ice removal in a safe and cost-effective manner,
taking into account safety, budget, personnel and environmental concerns. This
Chapter does not guarantee that the streets, public parking lots, city
maintained sidewalks, and other public areas will be free of snow and ice; but
rather attempts to maintain an adequate traveling surface for properly equipped
vehicles and pedestrians during winter conditions. Snow and ice removal from
public streets, public parking areas, city maintained sidewalks, and other
public areas is an emergency operation that takes precedence over other non-
emergency work for the public works department.
3-16-2   SNOW EMERGENCY DECLARATION.
A snow emergency is defined as a snowfall event of any amount of snow combined
with ice, rain, sleet. freezing rain and/or just wind that creates blowing and
drifting of newly accumulated snow which the City deems appropriate to declare
a snow emergency. The Mayor, the City Administrator and/or his/her designee may
declare a snow emergency. A snow emergency may be declared in advance of an
anticipated storm, during a storm, or after a storm. A snow emergency will
normally not last more than 24 hours past the end of the last snowfall or the
end of the snow event; but may be extended or shortened when conditions
warrant. The public will be informed of a snow emergency through mass media
outlets as deemed necessary by the Mayor or City Administrator.
(Ord. 22-23, Passed 12-11-23; Ord. 24-24, Passed 12-9-24)
3-16-3   SNOW REMOVAL ROUTES.
The City Council shall establish and maintain a priority list of streets,
public parking areas, city maintained sidewalks, and other public areas for
snow and ice removal by resolution.
3-16-4   DRIVEWAYS AND SNOW FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
City snowplows will not clear private driveways. The snow placed in driveways
by the city plows is an unavoidable consequence of removing snow from the
streets and it is the responsibility of the property owner to remove. Snow from
private driveways, parking lots and sidewalks may not be placed on city
streets. The only exception is snow in the Downtown Business District where the
proximity of buildings to the street leaves no place other than the street to
remove snow to. Downtown snow must be placed on the street in such a way that a
safety hazard is not created and the travel path of the street is not
obstructed.
3-16-5   REMOVAL OF SNOW AND ICE ACCUMULATIONS ON SIDEWALKS.
It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to remove snow and ice
accumulations promptly from sidewalks. Sidewalks include any ADA accessible
ramps. If a property owner does not remove snow and ice accumulations within 24
hours following the conclusion of a snow event, the City may do so and assess
the actual costs, in addition to a $50 administrative fee, against the property
owner, for collection in the same manner as a property tax. The City will first
attempt to make contact with the property owner.
(Ord. 22-23, Passed 12-11-23; Ord. 24-24, Passed 12-9-24)
3-16-6   VEHICLE PARKING DURING A SNOW EMERGENCY.
No person shall park, abandon or leave unattended any vehicle on any public
street, alley or City- owned off-street parking area during a snow emergency
proclaimed by the Mayor or City Administrator, unless the snow has been removed
or plowed from said street, alley or parking area and the snow has ceased to
fall. Vehicles parked on the street during a snow emergency are subject to tow
or a citation, pursuant to Cascade Code
3-3-94 at the owner's expense. The City will first attempt to make contact with
the owner, if the owner can be determined. A snow emergency parking ban shall
continue from its proclamation through the duration of the snow or ice storm
and the 24- hour period after cessation of the storm except as above provided
upon streets that have been fully opened. The ban shall be of uniform
application and the Police Chief is directed to publicize the requirements,
using all available news media, prior to the start time of each event. The
emergency may be extended or shortened when conditions warrant.

The public sewer shall be tapped with a tapping machine and a saddle
appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be glued and attached with
stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no time shall a building sewer be
constructed so as to enter a manhole unless special written permission is
received from the Superintendent and in accordance with the Superintendent
direction if such connection is approved.
         c.   No building sewer for residential or commercial buildings shall
be less than four inches in diameter. No building sewer for industries or
multiple dwellings shall be less than six inches in diameter.
         d.   Unless otherwise authorized, all building sewers shall have a
grade of not less than one-eighth (1/8) inch per foot. A grade of one-fourth
(1/4) inch per foot shall be used wherever practical.
         e.   All excavation shall be open trench work unless authorized by the
Superintendent. The foundation in the trench shall be formed to prevent any
subsequent settlement of the pipes. If the foundation is good firm earth, the
earth shall be pared or molded to give a full support to the lower quadrant of
each pipe. Bell holes shall be dug. Where the floor of the trench is of hard or
rocky material, the trench shall be excavated to four inches below the pipe and
brought back to the proper grade with gravel, course sand or similar material
so as to provide a firm foundation and uniform support for the building sewer
line. Backfilling shall be placed in layers and solidly tamped or packed up to
two feet above the pipe. Back-filling shall not be done until final inspection
is made by the Superintendent. Building sewers shall be laid straight at
uniform grade between connections or fittings.
         f.   Cleanouts shall be provided for each change in direction or grade
if the change exceeds 45 degrees and at least every 100 feet.
   7.   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth shall be sufficient to
afford protection from frost. All excavations required for the installation of
a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the
said Superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance
with A.S.T.M. Specification (Designation C12). No backfill shall be placed
until the work has been inspected by the Superintendent or the Superintendent's
representative. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   8.   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation
drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a
building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   9.   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and
regulations of the City, or the procedures set forth in appropriate
specifications of the A.S.T.M. and the W.P.C.F. Manual of Practice No. 9. All
such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the
prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Superintendent
before installation.
   10.   Each and every part of the building sewer shall be inspected and
approved by the Superintendent before being concealed or back-filled. The
applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Superintendent when
the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer.
The connection shall be made under the supervision of the Superintendent or the
Superintendent's representative.
   11.   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City.
   12.   The City shall, in no event, be held responsible for claims made
against it by reason of the breaking of any mains or service pipes, or by
reason of any other interruption of the service caused by the breaking of
machinery or stoppage for necessary repairs; and no person shall be entitled to
damages nor have any portion of a payment refunded for any interruption.
   12-1   Abatement of Violations. Construction or maintenance of building
sewer lines whether located upon the private property of any owner or in the
public right of way, which construction or maintenance is in violation of any
of the requirements of this chapter, shall be corrected at the owner’s expense
within thirty (30) days after date of official notice from the council of such
violation. If not made within such time the council shall in addition to other
penalties herein provided have the right to finish and correct the work and
assess the cost thereof to the property owner. Such assessment shall be
collected with and in the same manner as general property taxes.
   13.   The premises receiving sanitary sewer service, shall at all reasonable
hours, be subject to inspection by duly authorized personnel of the City.
   14.   The Owner of the property served by a building sewer shall be 100%
responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair, blockage, surface
replacement, and any damage resulting from operation, maintenance repair and
blockage of said building sewer, from the point of connection with the building
drain to the Public Sewer. The materials used to repair the right-of-way must
be the same original material such as concrete or asphalt, unless otherwise
pre-approved by the City.
   15.   Connection Charge. Before any permit is issued and connection made, a
connection charge shall be paid to the City. The City may determine what
connections will be made under this section and connections may be denied, or
an additional connection fee negotiated, if the City makes a determination that
the requested hookup will place an unreasonable burden on the water and/or
sewer mains. A connection fee will be charged for each time a new connection is
made to the sanitary sewer system regardless of whether the connection is made
to a stubbed-out sewer lateral or sewer main. The connection fee will be
established by Resolution of the City Council.

6-2-4-1   SPECIFICATIONS FOR SEWER SERVICE LINES
Purpose. This chapter governs the construction of new sewer service lines and
the replacement of existing sewer service lines in the city.
Utility Locations. Prior to beginning excavation, the contractor shall notify
all utility companies of the location of the excavation work and request field
location of their facilities. The contractor shall exercise care in excavating
near all utilities or service connections to these utilities. They shall be
protected, supported and maintained in service or restored to the condition in
which they were found. Where such utilities cannot be replaced so as to occupy
their original location, they shall be relocated by the respective utility
company with the cooperation and assistance of the contractor. In the case of
drain tile or sewers, the contractor shall relocate such facilities under the
direction of the City.
Trench Excavations. Excavation may be carried on by any reasonable method
preferred by the contractor which shall insure systematic progress without
danger to the completed work or the private or public property adjacent to the
work. Whenever the contractor shall excavate below the grade of the sewer
service line, they shall backfill the trench to grade with selected sand tamped
in place.
Sewer Service Taps. All service taps shall be performed by Sewer Department
personnel. They shall be located at the ten o’clock or two o’clock position on
the circumference of the pipe. No taps shall be made less than twelve inches
from a joint and never directly on top of the main. Taps shall be a minimum of
twelve inches apart.
Service Lines Sewer Saddle. On clay tile or P.V.C. sewer mains, a sewer saddle
is required and type shall be determined by the City Superintendent. A larger
saddle will be needed if the sewer main diameter is larger. A minimum of one 5-
gallon bucket of approved mortar mix is to be packed around and underneath the
saddle and under the sewer main.
Sewer Service Pipes. Service pipe shall be P.V.C. Schedule 40 or clay tile. The
diameter shall be 4-inch. If a larger diameter pipe is needed it must be
approved by the Superintendent before the contractor can proceed with the
project. A 6-inch service line shall only be connected to an 8-inch or larger
main. A service line of 8-inch diameter or larger shall require a manhole at
the connection.
Sewer Service Caps. Service caps shall be 4-inch Schedule 40, cemented to end
of stub-in.
Inspection. All material found during the progress of the work to have cracks,
flaws or other defects shall be rejected. All defective materials furnished by
the contractor shall be promptly removed by the contractor from the site. No
connections, replacements or cut-offs shall be covered or backfilled until
inspection and approval have been completed. Contractors shall call the Sewer
Department for inspection prior to any backfilling in the city right-of-way.
Work shall be uncovered for inspection at the order of the Superintendent and
shall be in full view from above the ditch, prior to backfilling.
Backfill Material. All backfill material shall be subject to the prior approval
of the city. If, in the opinion of the city, the material excavated constituted
unsuitable backfill, the contractor shall provide, unless otherwise stated, at
the contractor’s own expense, acceptable backfill material. No frozen material
shall be used for backfilling. All surplus excavated material which is not used
in backfilling shall be loaded and disposed of by the contractor at the
contractor’s own expense.
6-2-5   USE OF THE PUBLIC SEWERS.
   1.   Storm Water. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any
storm water, surface water, groundwater, roof run-off, sub-surface drainage,
uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any
sanitary sewer. Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be
discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or
storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent. Industrial
cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged on approval of the
Superintendent, to a storm sewer, combined sewer, or natural outlet.
      a.   Storm water conducted from roofs or other impervious areas shall be
dispersed entirely upon the grounds of the owner of the contributing property
or it shall be drained or conducted into ditches, storm drains or gutters where
available on public property or easements legally useable for that purpose, or
into public streams. No storm water shall be purposely directed onto a
neighboring property and any outlet must be at least ten (10) feet from the
common property line with any abutting owner or City right of way.
      b.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water,
surface water, groundwater, roof run-off, sub-surface drainage, including
interior and exterior foundation drains, downspouts, uncontaminated cooling
water or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer or combined
sewer.
      c.   Storm water and all other unpolluted water shall be discharged to a
storm sewer, except that unpolluted cooling or process water shall only be so
discharged upon approval by the Superintendent. The Superintendent may also
approve discharge of unpolluted water into a natural outlet or a combined
sewer, provided the discharge complies with applicable state and federal
regulations.
      d.   The City Engineer is authorized to grant an exemption from the
provisions of this section to permit the connection of downspouts into a
combined sewer or to permit any water to be discharged into a combined sewer
after written application is made for an exemption. A written permit shall be
issued granting the exemption if, in the opinion of the City Engineer:
         (1)   A reasonably available absorption area is not present for the
water;
         (2)   Allowing the downspout to discharge onto the ground, sidewalk,
street or alley will create a hazardous or unsatisfactory condition or the
failure to permit the discharge of water as applied for would create a
hazardous or unsatisfactory condition; or
          (3)   Disconnection from the sewer would require major structural
alteration.
(1999 Code, § 97.01) (Ord. 13-23, passed 8-14-23) Penalty, see § 53.99
   2.   Illegally Discharged Storm Water.
      a.   In the event it is determined that storm-water, surface water, water
from downspouts or any water is illegally discharged into any sanitary sewer or
combined sewer in violation of Chapter 97.01, the city shall serve a written
notice upon the person responsible for the illegal discharge, the owner of the
property, and any tenant occupying the property ordering the removal of the
illegal connection or discharge. The notice shall be signed by the City
Engineer or an authorized representative and shall allow 15 calendar days for
the removal of the illegal connection or discharge. Said notice will be served
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service, upon the
responsible person, owner and tenant. The notice shall provide for a right to a
hearing before the City Council on the order to remove. Any person requesting a
hearing before the City Council must submit a written request to the City
Administrator within 15 calendar days after receipt of the order to remove.
Failure to submit said request within 15 calendar days after receipt of the
order to remove shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and the
right to any appeal. The removal of the illegal connection or discharge
requires the disconnection of any pipe carrying the prohibited discharge to the
sewer system either at ground level or underground and the capping or blocking
of the remaining pipe so as to prevent any water from entering the sewer
system. The City shall have the prerogative to inspect and approve any removal.
         (1)   In the event the owner does not remove the illegal connection or
discharge and does not receive an exemption, the owner shall be charged a
surcharge based on roof area as set forth in the following schedule:
 
Roof Area                              Monthly Surcharge
Less than 3,000 square feet            $15
3,000 square feet to 4,999 square feet $30
5,000 square feet to 9,999 square feet $50
10,000 square feet and up              $100
 
         (2)   There shall be one surcharge per property, regardless of the
number of downspout connections. The City Engineer shall provide the Clerk with
a current list of buildings with downspout connections. The surcharge shall be
part of the sewer service bill and collected in the same manner.
         (3)   Nothing in this section shall preclude or abridge such other
legal rights the City may have to enjoin or deter illegal storm water
discharge. In the event that any person in violation of this section fails to
comply with the terms of this section after notice provided for herein and
following any requested hearing as provided for herein, the City may file an
action in the District Court to obtain injunction against continued violation
and any other appropriate relief allowed by law.
(Ord. 5-17, Passed July 27, 2017)
   3.   Surface waters exception. Special permits for discharging surface
waters to a public sanitary sewer may be issued by the Council upon
recommendation of the Superintendent where such discharge is deemed necessary
or advisable for purposes of flushing, but any permit so issued shall be
subject to revocation at any time when deemed to the best interests of the
sewer system.
   4.   Prohibited Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any of the following described waters or wastes to any public
sewers:
      a.   Flammable or Explosive Material. Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha,
fuel oil, or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid, or gas.
      b.   Toxic or Poisonous Materials. Any waters or wastes containing toxic
or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or
by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage
treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public
nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment
plant, including but not limited to cyanides in excess of two (2) milligrams
per liter as CN in the wastes as discharged to the public sewer.
      c.   Corrosive Wastes. Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or
having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment, and personnel of the sewage works.
      d.   Solid or Viscous Substances. Solid or viscous substances in
quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction to the flow in
sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the sewage works
such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal,
glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood,
paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk
containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
      e.   Excessive B.O.D., Solids or Flow. Any waters or wastes having (a) a
five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand greater than three hundred (300) parts
per million by weight, or (b) containing more than three hundred fifty (350)
parts per million by weight of suspended solids, or (c) having an average daily
flow greater than two (2) percent of the average sewage flow of the City, shall
be subject to the review of the Superintendent. Where necessary in the opinion
of the Superintendent, the owner shall provide, at the owner’s expense, such
preliminary treatment as may be necessary to (a) reduce the biochemical oxygen
demand to three hundred (300) parts per million by weight, or (b) reduce the
suspended solids to three hundred fifty (350) parts per million by weight, or
(c) control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes.
Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to proposed
preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the
Superintendent and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until
said approvals are obtained in writing.
   5.   Restricted Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged the following described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if
it appears likely in the opinion of the Superintendent that such wastes can
harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse
effect on the receiving stream or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public
property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming an opinion as to the
acceptability of these wastes, the Superintendent will give consideration to
such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and
velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of
the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of
treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent
factors. The substances restricted are:
      a.   High Temperature. Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher
than one hundred fifty (150) degrees F (65 degrees C).
      b.   Fat, Oil, Grease. Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease,

per liter or six hundred (600) milligrams per liter of dispersed or other
soluble matter.
      c.   Viscous Substances. Water or wastes containing substances which may
solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) and one
hundred fifty (150) degrees F (0 and 65 degrees C).
      d.   Garbage. Any garbage that has not been properly shredded, that is,
to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely under the flow
conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particle greater than
one-half (½) inch in any dimension.
      e.   Acids. Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling
wastes, or concentrated plating solution whether neutralized or not.
      f.   Toxic or Objectionable Wastes. Any waters or wastes containing iron,
chromium, copper, zinc, and similar objectionable or toxic substances; or
wastes exerting an excessive chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such
material received in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds
the limits established by the Superintendent for such materials.
      g.   Odor or Taste. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other
taste or odor producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits
which may be established by the Superintendent as necessary, after treatment of
the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of state, federal, or other
public agencies or jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
      h.   Radioactive Wastes. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-
life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      i.   Excess Alkalinity. Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of
9.5.
      j.   Unusual Wastes. Materials which exert or cause:
         1)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate).
         2)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions).
         3)   Unusual B.O.D., chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements
in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.
         4)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
“slugs” as defined herein.
      k.   Noxious or Malodorous Gases. Any noxious or malodorous gas or other
substance which either singly or by interaction with other wastes is capable of
creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into sewers
for their maintenance and repair.
      l.   Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials or substances
which react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
      m.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances which are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
   6.   Restricted Discharges - Powers. If any waters or wastes are discharged,
or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in Section 5 and which in
the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the
sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may:
      a.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the
public sewage system;
      b.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
      c.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
      d.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of Chapter 5 Utilities - Billing Charges.
   7.   Special Facilities. If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or
equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.
   8.   Control Manholes. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install
a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
   9.   Testing of Wastes. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the
characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter
shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods
of the Examination of Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public
Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty- four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended
solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all
outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples).
     10.   Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers,
or to a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent. Industrial cooling water
or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on approval of the
Superintendent, to a storm sewer, combined sewer, or natural outlet.
   11.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   12.   No statement contained in this article shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment, therefore, by
the industrial concern.
6-2-6   PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   1.   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance, or equipment which is a part of the sewage works. Any person
violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of
disorderly conduct.

monthly meter charge only applies if the property owner shuts the water off in
the basement or at the meter and has a lockable tag added by the City
employees.
   2.   Water Use Rates. In addition to the monthly meter charge, there shall
be imposed the following water rate charges based on actual metered usage

service to their property by shutting the curb stop off, a fee shall be charged
in the amount of $25.00 for reconnection.
   4.   No Meter Reading; Bill Calculation. Where a meter has ceased to
register or a meter reading could not be obtained, the quantity of water
consumed for billing purposes will be based on an average of the prior six
months consumption, and the conditions of the water service during the time the
meter did not register.

6-5-11   RATE OF SEWER RENT AND MANNER OF PAYMENT.
Each customer shall pay sewer service charges for the use of and for the
service supplied by the municipal sanitary sewer system based upon the amount
of water consumed as follows:
   1.   Monthly Meter Charge. There is imposed for each billing period
regardless of actual metered water usage during such billing period, a meter
charge to each separately metered residential, commercial, industrial premise,
directly or indirectly served by a connection to the sewer system, unless water
connection is shutoff by city employees at the curb box. If curb box is
defective and inoperable, monthly meter charge will be billed until such time
the curb box can be shut off. This charge shall be $19.00. If water connection
cannot be shut off at the curb box due to the water connection providing water
to multi-units, the monthly meter charge will be waived. The waiving of this
monthly meter charge only applies if the property owner shuts the water off in
the basement or at the meter and has a lockable tag added by the city
employees.
   2.   Sewer Use Rates. In addition to the monthly meter charge, there shall
be imposed the following sewer rate charges based on actual metered water usage
during the billing period, unless water has been shutoff at the curb box or a
lockable tag added to the meter or water shutoff in the basement by city
employees:
      a.   $11.83 per 1,000 gallons of usage.

6-5-12   DETERMINATION AND PAYMENT OF SEWER RENT FROM PREMISES WITH PRIVATE
WATER SYSTEMS.
Users whose premises have a private water system shall pay a sewer rent in
proportion to the water used and determined by the City Council either by an
estimate agreed to by the user or by metering the water system. The rates shall
be the same as provided in Section 6-5-10 applied as if a City water bill were
to be paid. Rent shall be paid at the same time and place as provided in
Section 6-5-10.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84(1))
Special Agreements Permitted. No statement in these chapters shall be construed
as preventing a special agreement, arrangement or contract between the council
and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted subject to special conditions, rate and cost as
established by the council.

6-5-13 UTILITY BILLING ERRORS AND ADJUSTMENTS POLICY.
   1   Intent and Purpose. This policy is intended to establish the maximum
time period for: (1) the collection of billing undercharges; and (2) the refund
or credit for billing overcharges. This rule shall supplement all other
applicable rules and policies of the City of Cascade that may pertain to the
calculation of utility service billing errors, overcharges and undercharges,
the recovery of undercharges, and the refund or credit for overcharges.
   2.   Joint Billing for Combined Services. The City Council is the governing
body of the City of Cascade and its water, sewer utilities and garbage
services. The City Council is solely responsible for the establishment,
imposition, adjustment, and collection of rates and charges, including billing
adjustments relating to overcharges and undercharges. However, pursuant to Iowa
Code section 384.84(8)(b), two or more city utilities, including board-governed
city utilities under Iowa Code chapter 388, may contract for the joint billing
or collection of combined service accounts. The City Council of Cascade, which
governs the city's water and sewer utilities, and the Board of Trustees of the
Cascade Municipal Utilities ("CMU"), which governs the city's gas and electric
utilities, have agreed that CMU will undertake the billing and collection of
combined service accounts for all of the city-owned utility services.
   3.   Duty to Review Usage and Notify. Customers and ratepayers ("Customers")
of the City's water and sewer utilities shall have a duty to review all billing
invoices and other billing communications sent to them, whether from the City
or from CMU, to monitor their utility usage, and to notify the City or CMU
promptly if the usage appears out of the ordinary, whether deficient or
excessive in general or relative to prior billings and usage. Such notification
shall be given to the City or to CMU, if there is an agreement to undertake
joint billing for combined service accounts. Failure to promptly notify the
City or CMU of a potential or suspected billing error may be a basis for denial
of a request for a refund or credit for an overcharge for the time period after
the customer was aware of or suspected the potential overcharge.
   4.   Time Period for Billing Adjustments. If for any reason the City or CMU
determines there has been a billing error with regard to the amounts due and
owing for water or sewer service, the City or CMU may adjust the amount due and
owing as provided in this rule or may authorize CMU to do so under the joint
billing agreement. The time period for recovery of undercharges and for a
refund or credit of overcharges shall be limited as follows:
      a.   The maximum time period for which an undercharge may be recovered
from the customer is three (3) years. The maximum time period for which an
overcharge may be refunded or credited to the customer is also three (3) years.
      b.   There shall be no recovery of an undercharge, nor a refund or credit
for an overcharge, for a time period that is more than three (3) years prior to
the time notification was given, whether by the customer or by the City or CMU,
as applicable.
      c.   In the case of a failure by the customer to promptly notify the City
or CMU, or by the City or CMU to promptly notify the customer, of a potential
or suspected overcharge or undercharge, there shall be no recovery of an
undercharge or refund or credit for an overcharge for the time period after the
customer suspected or was aware of the potential overcharge or the City or CMU
suspected or was aware of the potential undercharge.
      d.   No interest shall be applied to undercharges or overcharges.
      e.   CMU shall include the City Administrator in large payment
arrangements when there are undercharge billing adjustment payment arrangements
and in all cases inform the City of undercharges and overcharges involving the
water, sewer and garbage billing.
      f.   Examples:
         (1)   If a meter error results in a customer being overcharged by 10%
for each bill for the most recent two-year period and the customer gives the
City Utility prompt notice once the customer suspects the overcharge, the
customer will receive a full refund or credit of the overcharge.
         (2)   If the 10% overcharge has occurred for the most recent seven (7)
years and the customer gives prompt notice to the City Utility once the
customer suspects the overcharge, the customer will receive a refund or credit
for the most recent three (3) years of the overcharge.
         (3)   If the 10% overcharge occurred for a seven (7)-year period which
began ten (10) years ago and stopped three (3) years ago, and the customer
gives prompt notice to the Utility once the customer suspects the overcharge,
the customer will not receive a refund or credit for the overcharge because the
overcharge was more than three (3) years ago. The outcome is the same without
regard to whether the customer knew, should have known, or could have known of
the overcharge.
      g.   Recovery of Undercharges. Undercharges payable under this rule may
be recovered by the City or CMU by applying the amount of the undercharge to
the customer's bill in a lump sum or by applying it monthly over a period of
time up to one year. The customer and the City or CMU may enter into a payment
plan the terms of which are established by contract, though the offering of a
payment plan is solely at the City or CMU's discretion. A customer's failure to
pay an undercharge, or failure to enter into a payment plan, or a breach of a
payment plan, may result in a disconnection of service or in a lien upon the
property as provided by law.
      h.   Refund or Credit of Overcharges. Overcharges payable to a customer
may be refunded or credited to the customer as provided in this rule, in the
City or CMU's discretion. If the City or CMU provides a refund, it may be paid
in a lump sum or monthly over a period of time up to one year. If the City or
CMU provides a credit, the credit shall be applied to the customer's account
balance for the applicable utility for each billing cycle thereafter until the
credit has been used in full.
      i.   If a customer gives notice of a suspected or potential overcharge
and the City or CMU does not agree, and if the source of the overcharge
involves the meter, the customer's sole remedy is to request a meter test
pursuant to the rules of the applicable utility service.
      j.   This rule shall not be construed to require a cash refund to a
current customer if the amount is less than $5.00 nor to a previous customer in
an amount less than $10.00.
   5.   Authority. This policy is adopted under the authority reserved for and
granted to the City or CMU by applicable law, including the following:
      a.   Municipal Home Rule authority under the Iowa Constitution, as
amended (at the time of adoption of this Policy, Article III, Section 38A of
the Iowa Constitution) and its statutory implementation in Iowa Code chapter
364;
      b.   Iowa Code section 384.84, as amended regarding the establishment,
imposition, adjustment, and collection of rates and charges by the governing
body of the city utility; and
      c.   Iowa Code Chapter 388.
   6.   Non-Applicability and Waiver. The provisions of this policy are not
subject to and shall not be subject to or modified by the discovery rule or
theories of continuing violations, statutory law (unless expressly regulating
municipal utility ratemaking authority), provisions or theories of general
contract law, equitable principles, or other common law theories or remedies
which might otherwise have the effect of extending the time period for or the
amount of collection of underpayments and refunds or credit for overpayments.
By accepting utility service from the City, the customer expressly waives,
holds harmless from, and agrees not to assert any of the aforementioned claims,
causes of action, or theories against the City, or in relation to its sewer
service, water service, or financial management, in any forum whatsoever.
   7.   Severability. If any part or provision of this rule is legally declared
invalid or unenforceable by a court of law with proper jurisdiction, that part
or provision of the rule will be construed consistent with applicable law as
nearly as possible, and the remaining parts and provisions will remain in full
force and effect. Such invalidity or non-enforceability will not invalidate or
render unenforceable any other part or provision of this Policy.

6-7-13   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
The following general requirements shall be followed by all subdividers:
   1.   Land Suitability. No land shall be subdivided which is held unsuitable
for its intended use by the Commission for reasons of flooding, inadequate
drainage, soil, and rock formations with severe limitations for development,
susceptibility to mud slides or earth slides, severe erosion, potential,
unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal
capabilities, or any other feature harmful to the health, safety or welfare of
the future residents or property owners of the proposed subdivision or the
community at large. However, the Commission may approve preliminary and final
plats if subdividers improve lands consistent with the standards of this and
other applicable ordinances to make subdivision areas, in the opinion of the
Commission, suitable for their intended uses. The Commission may also approve
the preliminary and final plats if subdividers agree to make suitable
improvements and place a sum in escrow pursuant to Section 6-7-16 of this
chapter to guarantee performance. In determining the appropriateness of land
subdivision at a site, the Commission shall consider the objectives of this
chapter and:
      a.   The danger to life and property due to the increased flood heights,
or velocities caused by subdivision fill, roads, and intended uses.
      b.   The danger that intended uses may be swept on to other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
      c.   The adequacy of proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions under flood conditions.
      d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      f.   The requirements of the subdivision for a water-front location.
      g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed subdivision and land uses.
      h.   The compatibility of the proposed uses with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      i.   The relationship of the proposed subdivision to the comprehensive
plan and flood plain management program for the area.
      j.   The safety of access to the property for emergency vehicles in times
of flood.
      k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
      l.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   2.   Relation to Existing Streets.
      a.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
      b.   The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for
the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in
surrounding areas or conform to a plat for the neighborhood approved by the
Council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions
made continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
    3.   Acreage Subdivisions.
      a.   Where the plat submitted covers only a part of the subdivider’s
plat, a sketch of the prospective future system of the unsubmitted part shall
be furnished and the street system of the part submitted shall be considered in
the light of adjustments in connection with the street system of the part not
submitted.
      b.   Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building
lots such parcels shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.
      c.   Subdivisions showing unplatted strips or private streets controlling
access to public ways will not receive approval.
   4.   Minor Streets. Minor streets shall be so planned as to discourage
through traffic. Cul-de-sac streets are permitted where topography and other
conditions justify their use. Such streets shall not be longer than five
hundred (500) feet and shall terminate with a turnaround, having an outside
roadway diameter of at least ninety (90) feet and a street property line
diameter of at least one hundred-ten (110) feet. The right-of-way width of the
straight portion of such streets shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet. The
property line at the intersection of the turnaround and the straight portion of
the street shall be rounded at a radius of not less than fifty (50) feet.
   5.   Frontage Streets.
      a.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the City of Cascade may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation
along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      b.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a rail-road right-of-way
or limited access highway right-of-way, the City may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
   6.   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, and where the City finds it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
   7.   Street Geometrics.
      a.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-
five (125) feet shall be avoided.
      b.   A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial and collection streets.
      c.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a
radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than two hundred (200)
feet for minor and collector streets, and of such greater radii as the City
shall determine for special cases.
   8.   Street and Alley Widths.
      a.   Major streets shall have a minimum width of sixty-six (66) feet with
a minimum of forty-one (41) foot roadway.
      b.   Minor streets shall have a minimum width of sixty-six (66) feet with
a minimum of thirty-seven (37) foot roadway.
      c.   Minimum Construction Standards. Streets within any subdivision shall
be constructed, repaired or replaced in accordance with industry standards,
including but not limited to at least the minimum standards set forth in
Section 6-6-6.
(Ord. 9-17, Passed August 28, 2017)
   9.   Intersections.
      a.   Insofar as is practical, acute angles between streets at their
intersection are to be avoided.
      b.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than
sixty (60) degrees.
      c.   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius of ten (10) feet, or of a greater radius where the Commission may deem
it necessary. The Commission may permit comparable cutoffs or chords in place
of rounded corners.
   10.   Street Names. In general, streets running east and west shall be named
“avenues”. Streets running north and south shall be named “streets”. Streets
that loop around and exit in the same direction as they enter shall be named
“courts”. Streets that end in a cul-de-sac shall be named “lanes”. Streets that
are in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the name of
the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets shall not duplicate or
sound similar to existing street names. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the Commission.
   11.   Street Grades. Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed five
percent (5%), with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves. No street
grade shall be less than one-half (1/2) of one percent.
   12.   Alleys.
      a.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
      b.   The width of an alley shall be twenty (20) feet.
      c.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
      d.   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Commission.
   13.   Blocks.
      a.   No block may be more than one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320)
feet or less than five hundred (500) feet in length between the centerlines of
intersecting streets, except where, in the opinion of the Council,
extraordinary conditions unquestionably justify a departure from these limits.
      b.   In blocks over seven hundred (700) feet in length, the Council may

points, points of curves in streets, and all such intermediate points as shall
be required by the City. The markers shall be of such material, size and length
as may be approved by the City.
   18.   Because of the unconventional platting requirements of zero-lot line
developments as allowed by the Cascade Zoning Ordinance in the R-2 and R-
4 zoning districts, the City Council may waive specific requirements of this
section as applicable after receiving recommendation from the Planning and
Zoning Commission prior to creation of the preliminary plat and/or the final
plat. The request for specific waiver shall be made by the subdivider and shall
be presented to the Zoning Administrator preceding any formal plat submitted.
6-7-14   IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by this
chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and constructed in

subdivider shall connect or provide for the connection with such sanitary sewer
and shall provide within the subdivision the sanitary sewer system required to
make the sewer accessible to each lot in the subdivision. Sanitary sewers shall
be stubbed into each lot. Sewer systems shall be approved by the Commission and
the State Department of Health.
      b.   Where sanitary sewers are not available, other facilities, as
approved by the Commission and the State Department of Health, must be provided
for the adequate disposal of sanitary wastes.
      c.   Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the approval of the Commission.
6-7-15   INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council shall provide for the inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The subdivider shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
shall be issued until all fees are paid. The subdivder shall furnish the City
with a construction schedule prior to the commencement of any and all
construction, and notify the City not less than forty-eight (48) hours in
advance of readiness for required inspection.
6-7-16   COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.

a licensed engineer for the required public improvements. The City
Administrator shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications
and ordinances or other City requirements, and the agreements between
subdivider and the City.
6-7-17   PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement may be waived in whole or in part if the subdivider
will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing that improvements
not completed will be constructed within a period of one (1) year from final
acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not constitute
final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed,
and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the City.
6-7-18   MAINTENANCE BOND.
The subdivider shall also warrantee the materials and labor on the required
public improvements for a period of two (2) year after completion and
acceptance by resolution of the Council. Said warrantee shall be in the form of
a maintenance bond issued by a responsible surety company and approved by the
City of Cascade.
6-7-19   VARIANCES.
Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography or other
conditions, the Council may, upon recommendation from the Commission, vary,
modify or waive the requirements so that substantial justice may be done and
the public interest secured. Provided, however, such variance, modification or
waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this
chapter. In no case shall any variance or modification be more than minimum
easing of the requirements and in no instance, shall it be in conflict with any
zoning ordinance and such variances and waivers may be granted only by the
affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the Council.
6-7-20   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Upon recommendation from the Commission, any regulations or provisions of this
regulation may be changed and amended from time to time by the Council,
provided however, that such changes or amendments shall not become effective
until after a public hearing has been held, public notice of which shall have
been published at least once, not less than four (4) or more than twenty (20)
days before the date of the hearing.

   1.   Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   3.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of the
initial construction.
   4.   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazard.
   5.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.

official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
6-9-23   VARIANCES.
The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards:
   1.   Prohibited. No variance shall be granted for any development within the
Floodway District which would result in any increase in the 100-year flood
level. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be
based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed
for similarly situated lands.
   2.   Cause. Variances shall only be granted upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the Variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the Variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
   3.   Required To Afford Relief. Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the Variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
   4.   Notice To Applicant. In cases where the Variance involves a lower level
of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that (i) the issuance of a Variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (ii) such
construction increases risks to life and property.
   5.   Department of Natural Resources Approval. All Variances granted shall
have the concurrence or approval of the Department of Natural Resources.
6-9-24   HEARINGS BY BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal, an application for a
Conditional Use or a request for a Variance, the Board shall hold a public
hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public
notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing,
any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney and present written or
oral evidence. The Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such
information as is reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical
assistance and/or evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person
or agency, including the Department of Natural Resources.
6-9-25   DECISIONS OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal, Conditional Use or Variance
within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so long as
such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or
affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in writing,
setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision. In
granting a Conditional Use or Variance, the Board shall consider such factors
as contained in this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter
and may prescribe such conditions as contained in Section 6-9-27.
6-9-26   FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES IS BASED.
In passing upon applications for conditional uses or requests for Variances,
the Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of
this chapter and
   1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
   2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream
to the injury of others.
   3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
   4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
   5.   The importance of the service provided by the proposed facility to the
community.
   6.   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
   7.   The availability of alternate locations not subject to flooding for the
proposed use.
   8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
   9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for the area.
   10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
   11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
   12.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
6-9-27   CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO CONDITIONAL USES OR VARIANCES.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of Conditional Uses or Variances as it deems
necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may include,

the purposes of this chapter.
   5.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation or the particular area, flood velocities, durations, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and forces, and other factors associated with the
regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the applicant
submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that
the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area. Such
floodproofing may include, but is not necessarily limited to the following:
      a.   Anchorage to resist floatation and lateral movement.
      b.   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and shutters, or
similar methods of construction.
      c.   Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressure.
      d.   Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water
through walls.
      e.   Addition of mass or weight structures to resist floatation.

which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and storm
waters into the buildings or structures.
      k.   Location of all electrical equipment, circuits, and installed
electrical appliances in a manner which will assure they are not subject to
flooding.
   6.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a Court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of illegality. Such petition shall
be presented to the Court within thirty days after the filing of the decision
in the office of the Board.

provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
   1.   Value. No structural alteration, addition, or repair to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall exceed 50 percent
of its value at the time of its becoming a nonconforming use, unless the
structure is permanently changed to a conforming use.
   2.   Use Discontinued. If such use is discontinued for eighteen (18)
consecutive months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to
this chapter. The assessor shall notify the Administrator in writing of
instances of nonconforming uses which have been discontinued for eighteen (18)
months.
   3.   Destroyed. If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any
means, including floods, to an extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its
value prior to destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter.
   4.   Nuisances. Uses or adjuncts thereof which are or become nuisances shall
not be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.

her designee may request proof of continued compliance with this requirement at
any time during the twelve (12) month period and may rescind the exemption if
such proof is not provided.
         (2)   If the property is offered for sale, the City Administrator may
deny this exemption if the listing price is one hundred fifty percent (150%) or
greater than the assessed value of the real estate as determined by the County

under the above may request an exemption for a period of up to twelve (12)
months from the provisions of this chapter by filing a written application with
the City Administrator. The applicant shall present justification for the
exemption and shall show proof that the need for the exemption is not due to
action or inaction by the applicant or by any other party with control of the
property. In determining whether a request for exemption should be granted, the

      c.   Consent to Entry. An applicant for a permit or for a renewal shall
consent to the entry of the City Administrator, or his/her designee, at all
reasonable hours and upon reasonable notice for the purpose of inspection.
Refusal to consent to entry shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition

      d.   Consent to Emergency Inspections or Emergency Repairs. An applicant

Administrator, or his/her designee, if the City Administrator has reason to
believe that an emergency exists with respect to the building or structure that
creates, or tends to create, an imminent hazard to health, welfare, or safety
of the public. If the City Administrator believes that such an emergency
exists, then the City Administrator may enter the building to inspect the
premises, without notifying the responsible party or obtaining a warrant. If
the City Administrator finds an emergency situation exists that presents an
imminent hazard to the health, welfare or safety of the general public, then
the City Administrator may cause any reasonable action, including the
employment of necessary labor and materials, to perform emergency repairs to
alleviate the hazard. The owner shall pay costs incurred in the performance of
emergency repairs; and if not paid by the owner, the City may place a lien
against the property to recover the costs.

permit and responsible persons identified in a permit application shall
cooperate with and facilitate inspections of the premises at reasonable times
pursuant to reasonable notice. Obstructing a duly authorized inspection,
including refusing entry or access to portions of the building subject to the
permit, shall be a violation of this chapter. The owner shall notify the City
Administrator within thirty (30) business days of any changes to the contact
information of the owner or responsible person.
      f.   Continued Compliance. For the Vacant Building Permit to remain
valid, the building or structure shall continuously comply with the filed
Vacant Building Plan and the Vacant Building Maintenance Requirements of this
chapter, below. Failure to maintain the building in accordance with this
chapter shall be a violation of the City Code.
   7.   Process.
      a.   Inspections.
         (1)   Upon receipt of a complete initial application or renewal
application, including payment of required fees, the City Administrator or his/
her designee shall schedule an inspection.
         (2)   The City Administrator or his/her designee shall prepare an
inspection report, noting the condition of the property and any deficiencies
from the requirements of this chapter. The owner shall receive a copy of the
inspection report.
      b.   Vacant Building Permit. Upon a finding by the City Administrator
that the vacant building is secure, is not hazardous, and does not present a
public nuisance, the City Administrator shall issue a Vacant Building Permit.
      c.   If the Vacant Building Permit is denied, the City Administrator
shall notify the applicant in writing of the deficiencies. The applicant shall
be given a reasonable amount of time to correct deficiencies, which shall in no
case extend beyond thirty (30) days, unless extended by the City Administrator.
Failure to secure a valid permit shall be a violation of this chapter.
   8.   Appeals. Any determination of the City Administrator may be appealed to
the City Council. A request for a hearing must be made in writing and delivered
to the City Administrator within seven (7) working days from the date the

only to the extent that the City is permitted to exercise its power as a local
franchising authority with respect to the Company’s Video Service under

(10) years. At the end of this renewal term and any subsequent renewal term(s),
the Company may apply for a subsequent renewal of the Franchise by giving
written notice to the City not less than ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration of the Franchise. In determining whether to grant any subsequent
renewals, the City shall consider those factors prescribed by Federal law,
including (i) whether the Company has substantially complied with the material
terms of the Franchise and with applicable Legal and Regulatory Requirements;
(ii) the extent and quality of the Company’s Video Service; (iii) whether the
Company remains financially, legally and technically qualified to provide Video
Service; and (iv) whether renewal of the Franchise promotes the Video
Programming-related community needs and interests. The City may terminate the
Franchise for cause as provided in the Regulatory Ordinance. In the event the
Company elects to cease its operation of a Video System and to no longer
provide Video Service, the Company may terminate the Franchise by submitting
not less than ninety (90) days prior written notice to the City. The terms and
provisions of this Ordinance that can only be given proper effect if they
survive the termination of the Franchise will survive and remain enforceable
notwithstanding the termination, rescission, or expiration of the Franchise,
for any reason whatsoever. In addition, all provisions of this Ordinance will
remain valid as to any obligation incurred prior to termination of the
Franchise until such time as such obligations have been discharged. This
Section specifically preempts and supersedes any additional or different
franchise term or renewal conditions or requirements provided under the
Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-5   FRANCHISE FEE.
For the term of the Franchise, the Company shall pay to the City an annual
franchise fee of five percent (5%) of the Company’s annual Gross Revenues
received from subscribers for the provision of Video Service within the
Franchise Area. The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly at the Clerk’s
office as provided in the Cable Regulatory Ordinance. Any franchise fees
collected and paid under this Section may be credited to the City’s general
fund and used for the City’s lawful general fund purposes. The Company may
identify the franchise fee collected and paid under this Section as a separate
line item on the regular bill of each subscriber. This Section specifically
preempts and supersedes any additional or different franchise fee requirements
provided under the Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-6   PEG CAPITAL SUPPORT FEE.
For the term of the Franchise, the Company shall pay the City an annual PEG
capital support fee of fifteen cents ($0.15) per subscriber per month. The PEG
capital support fee shall be payable in the same manner as the franchise fee
payments. Any PEG capital support fee collected and paid pursuant to this
Section shall be used only for the support of public, educational and
governmental access equipment and facilities. The PEG capital support fee shall
not be deemed to be “franchise fees” and shall not be included in Gross
Revenues for purposes of this Chapter or applicable Legal and Regulatory
Requirements. The Company may identify the PEG capital support fee collected
and paid under this Section as a separate line item on the regular bill of each
subscriber. This Section specifically preempts and supersedes any additional or
different PEG capital support fee requirements provided under the Regulatory
Ordinance.
7-2-7   PEG CAPITAL GRANT.
For the term of the Franchise, the Company shall provide the City with an
annual capital grant in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00). The PEG
capital grant shall be payable on or before January 30 each year at the Clerk’s
office as provided in the Cable Regulatory Ordinance. Any PEG capital grant
paid pursuant to this Section shall be used solely for the acquisition and
maintenance of capital equipment and facilities in support of educational and
governmental programming. The PEG capital grant shall not be deemed to be
“franchise fees” for purposes of this Chapter or applicable Legal and
Regulatory Requirements. This Section specifically preempts and supersedes any
additional or different PEG capital grant requirements provided under the
Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-8   PEG ACCESS EQUIPMENT AND CAPACITY.
The Company shall not be required to provide PEG access equipment as provided
under the Regulatory Ordinance. For the term of the Franchise, the Company
shall designate a sufficient amount of channel capacity on the Video System to
allow the provision of a comparable number of public, educational, and
governmental channels that the Company has activated and provided in the
Franchise Area under the terms of the Franchise Ordinance. If no such channels
are active, the City may during the term of the Franchise request a maximum of
two public, educational, and governmental channels in accordance with the
qualifications and limitations set forth in the Cable Regulatory Ordinance. The
public, educational, and governmental content to be provided pursuant to this
Section and the operation of the public, educational, and governmental channels
shall be the responsibility of the City, and the Company shall be responsible
only for the transmission of such content, subject to technological restraints.
The City shall ensure that all transmissions, content, or programming to be
transmitted by the Company pursuant to this Section are provided or submitted
to the Company in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and
transmitted by the Company, without requirement for additional alteration or
change in the content, over the Video System, which is compatible with the
technology or protocol utilized by the Company to deliver Video Service. At its
election, the City may reasonably request the Company to make any necessary
change to the form of any programming, furnished for transmission, which shall
be charged to the City, not to exceed the Company’s incremental costs. In that
case, the City shall have up to twelve (12) months to reimburse the Company for
such costs. The provision of such transmissions, content, or programming to the
Company shall constitute authorization for the Company to carry such
transmissions, content, or programming, at the Company’s option, beyond the
jurisdictional boundaries of the Franchise Area. This Section specifically
preempts and supersedes any additional or different PEG access equipment and
capacity requirements provided under the Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-9   INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK.
For the term of the Franchise, the Company shall provide an Institutional
Network comparable to the Institutional Network that the Company has provided
in the Franchise Area under the terms of the Franchise Ordinance, including

Network:
City Hall
Fire Station
Cascade Public Library
Aquin System
Western Dubuque Community Senior and Junior High School
Western Dubuque Community Elementary School
The City may from time to time request reasonable additions or modifications to
the Institutional Network, provided that, (a) the total revenues forgone by the
Company from the provision of Video Service to public institutions, public or
parochial schools, or civic and governmental entities at no charge shall be
limited to an amount not to exceed the existing total of forgone revenues
associated with providing such services to such institutions and (b) the total
amount of direct or indirect financial support provided for an Institutional
Network shall be limited to ongoing maintenance and support of the existing
Institutional Network. For the purposes of this Section, maintenance and
support shall only include the reasonable incremental cost of moves, changes,
and restoring connectivity of the fiber or coaxial cable lines up to a
demarcation point at any location within the Institutional Network. This
Section specifically preempts and supersedes any additional or different
Institutional Network requirements provided under the Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-10   BONDING REQUIREMENTS.
For the term of the Franchise and provided that the Company maintains its
principal place of business within the Franchise Area, the Company shall not be
required to provide any form of performance or surety bond as provided under
the Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-11   CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS.
The Company shall comply with customer service standards consistent with those
contained in applicable FCC Rules, and shall maintain a local toll-free
telephone number for customer service contacts. This Section specifically
preempts and supersedes any additional or different customer service standards
provided under the Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-12   TECHNICAL STANDRDS.
The Company shall comply with technical standards consistent with those
contained in applicable FCC Rules. This Section specifically preempts and
supersedes any additional or different technical standards provided under the
Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-13   NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE; EQUAL PROTECTION.
The Franchise is nonexclusive and shall in no way prevent the City from
granting or renewing any other franchise for Cable Service or Video Service in
accordance with applicable Iowa and Federal laws. In the event the City enters
into a franchise, permit, license authorization or other agreement of any kind
with any Person other than the Company, to use or occupy the Public Right of
Way for the purpose of constructing, operating or maintaining a system for
providing Cable Service or Video Service to any part of the Franchise Area, the
material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained
herein, in order that one service provider not be granted an unfair competitive
advantage or another service provider, and to provide all Persons equal
protection under the law.
7-2-14   CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION.
The Company shall construct, install, maintain, operate, repair, replace and
remove the Video System in a manner consistent with accepted technical and
engineering standards and in accordance with all applicable Legal and
Regulatory Requirements. All facilities and equipment comprising the Video
System and located in the Public Right of Way shall be located so as to cause
minimum interference with the proper use of the Public Right of Way and to
cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of
property owners who adjoin any Public Right of Way. In case of any facilities
or equipment causing interference with the Public Right of Way, the Company
shall, at its own cost and expense and in a commercially reasonable manner,
modify, remove or relocate such facilities or equipment. In the event that at
any time during the term of the Franchise the City lawfully elects to alter or
change any street, alley or other Public Right of Way, the Company shall, if
necessary and upon reasonable notice from the City, modify, remove or relocate
any facilities or equipment at its own cost an expense and in a commercially
reasonable manner, provided that where public funds are available to compensate
for such removal or relocation under applicable Legal and Regulatory
Requirements, the Company shall not be required to pay such costs. Decisions
concerning the need for relocation of facilities shall be made and applied to
all users of the affected Public Right of Way (including the City and any of
its Affiliates) in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner. In
connection with any construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair
project, the City and the Company shall communicate and coordinate with each
other (and with other private and public utility companies utilizing the
affected Public Right of Way and any third party contractors involved with any
project) in a timely and open manner in order to limit the potential need for
relocation of facilities and to minimize costs and disruption of utility
services in connection with any required relocations. In case of any
disturbance or damage to a Public Right of Way, the Company shall, at its own
cost and expense and in a commercially reasonable manner approved by the City,
replace and restore such right of way to as good a condition as before the
Company’s activities were commenced. This Section specifically preempts and
supersedes any additional or different construction and installation
requirements provided under the Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-15   SERVICE EXTENSIONS.
The Company shall provide service to residents on a nondiscriminatory basis,
and shall not deny access to Video Service to any resident or neighborhood on
the basis of income. The Company shall serve all residents of the City, except
to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain or other factors render
providing service commercially impracticable or technically infeasible. For
purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this Section, and to
provide for a commercially reasonable and non-discriminatory policy governing
extensions of video service within the City, the Company shall extend service
to new subscribers at the normal installation charge and monthly rate for
customers taking the same service, where there is an average of at least forty-
five (45) homes per each linear mile of new facilities construction. In the
event the requirements of this Section are not met, extensions of Video Service
shall be required only on a basis which is commercially reasonable. Nothing in
the preceding shall prohibit the Company from offering Video Service in any
area not meeting the preceding density requirements on terms acceptable to the
Company. This Section specifically preempts and supersedes any additional or
different service extension standards provided under the Regulatory Ordinance.
7-2-16   OWNERSHIP AND REMOVAL.
The Video System shall be and remain the exclusive property of the Company at
all times and for all purposes. Any costs, expenses, taxes or other assessments
arising from or related to the construction, installation, maintenance,
operation, repair, replacement and removal of the Video System shall be the
sole responsibility of the Company. Upon expiration or termination of the
Franchise in accordance with this Chapter, the Company shall, upon written
request of the City, at its own cost and expense and within a commercially
reasonable time under the circumstances, remove all facilities and equipment
comprising the Video System and restore the Public Right of Way to as good a
condition as before the Company’s activities were commenced. In the event the
Company fails to remove its facilities and equipment within a reasonable time
after the written request of the City, the City may accept bids for a contract
to remove the facilities and equipment. The Company shall have the right to bid
on such a contract. The City may award the contract to the appropriate bidder
and charge the costs of such contract to the Company. The provisions of this
Section shall not apply to facilities or equipment of the Company which are
buried; provided, however, the Company shall transfer ownership to the City of
any buried facilities and equipment which are not removed. Nothing in this
Section shall require the Company to remove or transfer ownership of any
facilities or equipment comprising the Video System so long as such facilities
or equipment are being utilized by the Company or an Affiliate to provide
telecommunications services or other communications or data services to
subscribers within the City.
7-2-17   CONFIDENTIALITY OF PROTECTED INFORMATION.
Any Protected Information of the Company, and the results derived in any way
from such information, is and will remain the sole and exclusive property of
the Company, and the City has no right or license in or to the Company’s
Protected Information. Protected Information of the Company that has been
disclosed to the City will be maintained in confidence by the City, which will
safeguard this information using the same degree of care as it uses to
safeguard its own Protected Information, but in no case less than a reasonable
degree of care. Without limiting the preceding, the City will (a) limit access
to the Company’s Protected Information to those of its Representatives with a
need to know such Protected Information for the performance of the City’s
responsibilities and obligations under this Chapter and the Regulatory
Ordinance and (b) limit use of the Company’s Protected Information for the
exclusive purpose of fulfilling its obligations and responsibilities under this
Chapter and the Regulatory Ordinance. The City has established and will
maintain commercially reasonable safeguards against the destruction, loss,
alteration of or unauthorized use of or access to the Company’s Protected
Information in the possession of the City or its Representatives, which
safeguards will include policies for the disposal/destruction of any such data
that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the materials to be disposed of
or destroyed. The City warrants that it will take all steps necessary to ensure
fulfillment of this obligation and will take all reasonable measures, including
court proceedings, to restrain its Representatives from unauthorized disclosure
or use of the Company’s Protected Information. In the event a subpoena or other
legal process is served upon the City that, pursuant to the requirement of a
Governmental or Regulatory Authority, requires the disclosure of the Company’s
Protected Information, the City will notify the Company promptly upon receipt
of such subpoena or other request for legal process (unless such notice is
prohibited by applicable Legal or Regulatory Requirements), and will cooperate
with the Company, at the Company’s expense, in any lawful effort by the Company
to contest the legal validity or scope of such subpoena or other legal process.
7-2-18   LEGAL COMPLIANCE; SEVERABILITY.
The rights and obligations of the Company and the City under this Chapter shall
be subject to, and are intended to comply in all respects with, all applicable
Legal and Regulatory Requirements. Each party agrees to take all such further
acts and execute all such further documents as the other party reasonably may
request to fulfill their respective obligations under this Chapter or to assist
the requesting party in complying with all Legal and Regulatory Requirements
applicable to such party’s rights and obligations under this Chapter. Every
provision of this Chapter is intended to be severable. If any provision hereof
is invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever under the applicable
Legal and Regulatory Requirements of a particular jurisdiction, this Chapter
will be construed and enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable provision
were not a part of this Chapter for purposes of that jurisdiction, and the
remaining provisions of this Chapter will remain in full force and effect and
will not be affected by the invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance from this Chapter. Moreover, a provision as similar in terms to the
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be valid and
enforceable in the applicable jurisdiction will be substituted automatically as
part of this Chapter in lieu of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision. If applicable Legal and Regulatory Requirements are subsequently
amended or interpreted by an appropriate Governmental or Regulatory Authority
in a way that causes any provision of this Chapter that was formerly invalid or
unenforceable to become valid or enforceable, that provision (to the extent
that it subsequently becomes valid and enforceable) will be considered to be
adopted as part of this Chapter as of the effective date of that amendment or
interpretation.
7-2-19   FORCE MAJEURE.
The Company shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance of any
part of its obligations under this Chapter from any cause beyond its control
and without its fault or negligence, including acts of God, acts of civil or
military authority, government regulations, adverse judicial proceedings,
embargoes, epidemics, war, terrorist acts, riots, insurrections, fires,
explosions, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, strikes, power blackouts,
major environmental disturbances, unusually severe weather conditions,
inability to secure products or services of other persons or transportation
facilities or acts or omissions of transportation common carriers.
7-2-20   ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER.
The Company shall not assign or transfer any right granted under this Chapter
to any other Person without the prior written consent of the City; provided
that such prior written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
if the proposed assignee or transferee agrees in writing to assume the
Company’s obligations under this Chapter, including compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Chapter and the applicable provisions of the Regulatory
Ordinance. Notwithstanding the preceding or anything in this Chapter or the
Regulatory Ordinance to the contrary, no restrictions or special rights with
respect to assignment or transfer of the Franchise or the Video System shall
apply to transfers from the Company to any Affiliate of the Company. This
Section specifically preempts and supersedes any additional or different
assignment or transfer restrictions or rights provided under the Regulatory
Ordinance.
7-2-21   THIRD PARTY LIABILITY.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to create civil liability by one party
for actions, omissions or negligence of the other party, or of the other
party’s agents, employees, officers or assigns. This Chapter shall not be
interpreted or construed to provide any third parties (including, but not
limited to the Company’s customers) with any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or any other right as against the Company or the
City. Each of the Company and the City shall bear responsibility for its own
actions, omissions and negligence. Without limiting the preceding, the Company
shall hold the City harmless from any claim, liability or damage arising from
or caused by the Company’s activities under the Franchise.
7-2-22   NOTICES.
All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Chapter or
the Regulatory Ordinance must be in writing and will be deemed to have been
duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with confirmation of receipt), (b) sent
by email or facsimile (with confirmation of receipt), provided that a copy is
mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested or (c) when received by the
addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service

7-3-1   ADMINISTRATION OF RULES AND REGULATIONS.
The City has the legal authority to administer and shall enforce against any
non-municipally owned cable television system operator, as permitted therein,
the provisions of Part 76, Subpart N of the Rules and Regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), concerning Cable Rate Regulation, 47
C.F.R. §§76.900 et. seq., as they currently read and hereafter may be amended,
which are herewith incorporated by reference.
7-3-2   RATE REGULATION PROCEEDINGS.
Any rate regulation proceedings conducted hereunder shall provide a reasonable
opportunity for consideration of the views of any interested party, including
but not limited to, the City or its designee, the Cable Operator, subscribers,
and residents of the franchise area. In addition to all other provisions
required by the laws of the State of Iowa and by the City, and in order to
provide for such opportunity for consideration of the views of any interested
party, the City shall take the following actions:
   1.   The City shall publish notice as provided in Section 362 of the Code of
Iowa and shall mail, by certified mail, to the Cable Operator a notice of the
intent to conduct a public proceeding on basic service tier rates and/or
charges for equipment to receive such basic service tier, as defined by the
FCC.
   2.   The public notice shall state, among other things, that cable
television rates are subject to municipal review and explain the nature of the
rate review in question; that any interested party has a right to participate
in the proceeding; that public views may be submitted in the proceeding,
explaining how they are to be submitted and the deadline for submitting any
such views; that a decision concerning the reasonableness of the cable
television rates in question will be governed by the Rules and Regulations of
the FCC; and that the decision of the City is subject to review by the FCC.
   3.   The City shall conduct a public proceeding to determine whether or not
the rates or proposed rate increases are reasonable. The City may delegate the
responsibility to conduct the proceeding to any duly qualified and eligible
individual(s) or entity. If the City or its designee cannot determine the
reasonableness of a proposed rate increase within the time period permitted by
the FCC Rules and Regulations, it may announce the effective date of the
proposed rates for an additional period of time as permitted by the FCC Rules
and Regulations, and issue any other necessary or appropriate order and give
public notice accordingly.
   4.   In the course of the rate regulation proceeding, the City may require
additional information from the Cable Operator that is reasonably necessary to
determine the reasonableness of the basic service tier rates and equipment
charges. Any such additional information submitted to the City shall be
verified by an appropriate official of the cable television system supervising
the preparation of the response on behalf of the entity, and submitted by way
of affidavit or under penalty of perjury, stating that the response is true and
accurate to the best of that person’s knowledge, information and belief formed
after reasonable inquiry.
   5.   The City may request proprietary information, provided that the City
shall consider a timely request from the Cable Operator that said proprietary
information shall not be made available for public information, consistent with
the procedures set forth in Section 0.459 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.
Furthermore, said proprietary information may be used only for the purpose of
determining the reasonableness of the rates and charges or the appropriate rate
level based on a cost-of-service showing submitted by the Cable Operator.
   6.   The City may exercise all powers under the laws of evidence applicable
to administrative proceedings under the laws of the State of Iowa and by this
Code of Ordinances to discover any information relevant to the rate regulation
proceeding, including, but not limited to, subpoena, interrogatories,
production of documents, and deposition.
   7.   Upon termination of the rate regulation proceeding, the City shall
adopt and release a written decision as to whether or not the rates or proposed
rate increase is reasonable or unreasonable, and, if unreasonable, its remedy,
including prospective rate reduction, rate prescription, and refunds.
   8.   The City may not impose any fines, penalties, forfeitures or other
sanctions, other than permitted by the FCC Rules and Regulations, for charging
an unreasonable rate or proposing an unreasonable rate increase.

protect the health, safety and welfare of its residents; protect residents from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and
character of the surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of blight;

The taxes levied on the taxable property in the Urban Renewal Area each year by
and for the benefit of the State of Iowa, the City, the County and any school
district or other taxing district in which the Urban Renewal Area is located,
shall be divided as follows:
   1.   That portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate at which
the tax is levied each year by or for each taxing district upon the total sum
of the assessed value of the taxable property in the Urban Renewal Area, as
shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the
first calendar year in which the City certifies to the County Auditor the
amount of loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds payable from the special fund
referred to in paragraph 2, below, shall be allocated to and when collected be
paid into the fund for the respective taxing district as taxes by or for said
taxing district into which all other property taxes are paid. For the purpose
of allocation taxes levied by or for any taxing district which did not include
the territory in the Urban Renewal Area on the effective date of this
ordinance, but to which the territory has been annexed or otherwise included
after the effective date, the assessment roll applicable to property in the
annexed territory as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the effective
date of the ordinance which amends the plan for the Urban Renewal Area to
included the annexed area, shall be sued in determining the assessed valuation
of the taxable property in the annexed area.
   2.   That portion of taxes each year in excess of such amounts shall be
allocated to and when collected be paid into a special fund of the City to pay
the principal and interest on loans, moneys, advanced to or indebtedness,
whether funded, refunded assumed or otherwise, including bonds issued under the
authority of Section 403.9(1), of the Code of Iowa, incurred by the City to
finance or refinance in whole or in part, projects in the Urban Renewal Area,
except that the taxes for the payment of bonds and interest of each taxing
district shall be collected against all taxable property within the taxing
district without limitation by the provisions of this ordinance. Unless and
unit the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in the Urban Renewal
Area exceeds the total assess value of the taxable property in such areas shown
by the assessment roll referred to in paragraph 1 of this section, all of the
taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property in the Urban Renewal Area
shall be paid into the funds for the respective taxing districts as taxes by or
for said taxing districts in the same manner as all other property taxes. When
such loans, advances, indebtedness, and bonds, if any, and interest thereon,
have been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable
property in the Urban Renewal Area shall be paid into the funds for the
respective taxing districts in the same manner as taxes on all other property.
   3.   The portion of taxes mention on paragraph 2 of this section and the
special fund into which that portion shall be paid may be irrevocably pledged
by the City for the payment of the principal and interest on loans, advances,
bonds issued under the authority of Section 403.9(1) of the Code of Iowa, or
indebtedness incurred by the City to finance or refinance in whole or in part
projects in the Urban Renewal Area.
   4.   As used in this section the word “taxes” includes, but is not limited
to, all levies on an ad valorem basis upon land or real property.

15A.01   Purpose
15A.02   Definitions
15A.03   Eligibility
15A.04   Application
15A.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a property tax exemption for shell
buildings constructed by community development organizations or for-profit
entities for speculative purpose in accordance with 427.1(27) of the Code of
Iowa.
15A.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this Chapter the following terms are defined as follows:
   1.   Community development organization means a City organization or a
multi-community group formed for one or more of the following purposes:
      A.   To promote, stimulate, develop and advance the business prosperity
and economic welfare of the community, area or region and its citizens.
      B.    To encourage and assist the location of new business and industry.
      C.   To rehabilitate and assist existing business and industry.
      D.   To stimulate and assist in the expansion of business activity.
For purposes of this definition, a community development organization must have
at least fifteen (15) members with representation from the government at the
level or levels corresponding to the community development organization’s area
of operation; a private sector lending institution; a community organization in
the area; a business in the area and private citizens in the community.
   2.   New Construction means new buildings or structures and includes new
buildings or structures which are constructed as additions to existing
buildings or structures. New construction also includes reconstruction or
renovation of an existing building or structure which constitutes complete
replacement of an existing building or structure or refitting of an existing
building or structure, if the reconstruction or renovation of the existing
building or structure is required due to economic obsolescence, if the
reconstruction is necessary to implement recognized industry standards for the
manufacturing or processing of products and the reconstruction or renovation is
required in order to competitively manufacture or process products or for
community development organizations or for-profit entities to market a building
or structure as a speculative shell building, which determination must receive
prior approval by city council.
   3.   Speculative shell building means a building or structure owned and
constructed or reconstructed by a community development organization or a for-
profit entity without a tenant or buyer for the purpose of attracting an
employer or user which will complete the building to the employer’s or user’s
specification for manufacturing, processing or warehousing the employer’s or
user’s product line.
15A.03   ELIGIBILITY.
The new construction of shell buildings or the portion of the value added to
the building being reconstructed or renovated in order to become speculative
shell building by the community development organization or for-profit entity
is eligible for property tax exemption commencing the assessment year in which
the building is first assessed or in which the reconstruction or renovation
first adds value. The exemption shall continue until the property is leased or
sold or until terminated by ordinance of the council. Eligibility for an
exemption as a speculative shell building shall be determined as of February 1
of the assessment year. However, an exception shall not be granted a
speculative shell building of a for-profit entity if the building is used by
the for-profit entity or a subsidiary or majority owners thereof for other than
as a speculative shell building. If the shell building or any portion of the
shell building is leased or sold, the portion of the shell building which is
leased or sold shall not be entitled to an exemption under this section for
subsequent years.
15A.04   APPLICATION.
An application shall be filed with the county assessor with a copy to the city
clerk for each project for which an exemption is claimed in accordance with
Section 427B.4 of the Code of Iowa.
