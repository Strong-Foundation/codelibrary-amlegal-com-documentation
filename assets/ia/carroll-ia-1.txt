estate.

25.01 Utility Established  25.04 Control of Funds
25.02 Appointment of Board 25.05 Discriminatory Rates Illegal
25.03 Powers of Board       
 
25.01 UTILITY ESTABLISHED.
The voters of the City of Carroll approved at a special election on February
17, 1998, two propositions: authorizing the establishment of a municipally
owned broadband cable communications or television system (including video,
voice, telephone, data, and all other forms of communications and cable
communications) utility, and placing the management and control of such system
in a Board of Trustees consisting of five trustees. Pursuant to said election
and Chapters 364 and 388 of the Code of Iowa, there was established the Carroll
Communications Utility and Carroll Communications Utility Board of Trustees.
Ordinance 9812 and Resolution 9832 established said Utility and said Board,
both passed by the Council on March 30, 1998. However, on October 21, 1998, the
Supreme Court of Iowa ruled in the case of Iowa Telephone Association v. City
of Hawarden, docket No. 145/97-83 that a city’s ordinance containing authority
for a telephone utility was invalid. This ruling was reconsidered and amended
by ruling filed February 17, 1999, holding that any “cable provider” including
a municipality is allowed to provide telephone service as well. Therefore, the
City finds it necessary and appropriate to reconstitute the Carroll
Communications Utility and Carroll Communications Utility Board of Trustees in
their original form as created by the Council in Resolution 9832 and Ordinance
9812. The Board created by Ordinance 9812 and Resolution 9832 and all actions
taken by that Board are ratified and reaffirmed to the fullest extend not
inconsistent with the two law changes. Ordinances 9828 is repealed.
25.02 APPOINTMENT OF BOARD.
The Mayor shall appoint the Board members, subject to approval of the Council.
The Council shall by resolution provide for staggered six-year terms and shall
set the compensation for the Board members. A Board member appointed to fill a
vacancy occurring by reason other than the expiration of a term is appointed
for the balance of the unexpired term. A public officer or a salaried employee
of the City may not serve on the Utility Board.
25.03 POWERS OF THE BOARD.
The Utility Board may be a party to legal action. The Utility Board may
exercise all powers of the City in relation to the City Communications Utility
it administers, including but not limited to the power to fix fees and charges,
collect and disburse money, enter into contracts for services, incur debts,
employ and discharge managers and employees and such other persons as are
necessary to carry out the purposes of the Utility. The powers of the Board are
subject to the following exceptions:
1.   The Board may not certify taxes to be levied, pass ordinances or
amendments, or issue general obligation or special assessment bonds.
2.   The title to all property of the City Communications Utility must be held
in the name of the City but the Utility Board has all the powers and
authorities of the City with respect to the acquisition by purchase,
condemnation or otherwise, lease, sale or other disposition of such property
and the management, control and operation of the same, subject to the
requirements, terms, covenants, conditions, and provisions of any resolutions
authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds, pledge orders or other obligations
which are payable from the revenues of the City Communications Utility, and
which are then outstanding.
3.   The Board shall make to the Council a detailed annual report, including a
complete financial statement.
4.   Immediately following a regular or special meeting of the Utility Board,
the Secretary shall prepare a condensed statement of the proceedings of the
Board and cause the statement to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. The statement must include a list of all claims
allowed, showing the name of the person or firm making the claim, the reason
for the claim, and the amount of the claim. Salary claims must show the gross
amount of the claim except that salaries paid to persons regularly employed by
the Utility, for services regularly performed by them, must be published once
annually showing the gross amount of the salary.
25.04 CONTROL OF FUNDS.
The Utility Board shall control tax revenues allocated to the Carroll
Communications Utility it administers and all money derived from the operation
of the Carroll Communications Utility, the sale of utility property, interest
on investments or from any other source related to the Carroll Communications
Utility. All Carroll Communications Utility money received must be held in a
separate utility fund, with a separate account or accounts for each City
utility or combined utility system. Money may be paid out of the Carroll
Communications Utility account only at the direction of the Utility Board.

2.   Prohibited Parking.
No person shall cause, undertake, permit or allow the outside parking and
storage of vehicles on property used for residential purposes and/or on
residentially zoned property unless it complies with the following
requirements:
Front yard or side yard, corner lots: Vehicles which are parked or stored
outside in any front yard, or any side yard of corner lot areas must be on an
all-weather surface driveway which shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the
front yard of any lot or the side yard of a corner lot. Driveways exceeding
forty percent (40%) of the front yard of any lot or the side yard of a corner
lot prior to the adoption of this section are exempt provided no additional
surface area is added. This provision, however, shall not prevent the
construction of hard surface paving to access the garage(s) for multiple
attached dwellings, provided the design is approved by City building officials.
Exceptions: During emergency snow removal operations (when snow ordinance is in
effect), vehicles may be parked in a manner whereas the entire vehicle may be
parked in any portion of a residentially zoned property or any property used
for residential purposes. Said vehicles must then be moved to normal parking
(all-weather surface) within twenty-four (24) hours following the cancellation

unsightly areas, (c) prevents full use of residential streets for residential
parking, (d) decreases adjoining landowners' and occupants' enjoyment of their
property and neighborhood, and (e) otherwise adversely affects property values

93.01 WATER SHORTAGES.
During and following drought conditions which may occur from time to time, the
supply of water available to the Water Treatment Plant of the City may become
significantly and seriously depleted so that there will not then be a
sufficient supply of water to meet the customary and usual demand indefinitely.
Under those conditions, the Council may find and declare, by resolution, a
public emergency water shortage, during which time it may require any or all of
the water conservation methods set forth in Section
93.02 of this chapter for the purpose of producing an orderly and equitable
curtailment of water consumption until, by resolution, the Council finds and
declares the water shortage emergency to be ended. The Council may specifically
authorize by resolution any of the water conservation measures set forth in
Section
93.02 and, in addition or in the alternative, may authorize the Mayor or City
Manager, or both, to designate by proclamation which water conservation
measures or additional water conservation measures shall apply.
93.02 WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES.
The Council, by resolution, or the Mayor or City Manager, by proclamation, if
authorized, may select from among the following water conservation measures:
1.   There may be voluntary water usage restrictions on the following
activities:
   A.   Watering of established residential lawns, gardens, plants, trees, or
shrubs, including but not limited to a total ban on such watering, alternate-
day watering, or watering limited to, but not more than, a certain amount of
watering within a certain specified period of time or within a particular time
frame. In this connection, if circumstances so permit, restrictions may also be
varied as between lawns, gardens, plants, trees and shrubs and restrictions may
be varied as between established lawns and plantings, as compared to new
seeding or sod or new plantings. The newly planted lawns, gardens, seeding,
sod, and plantings may be exempt for a period of five (5) weeks.
   B.   Residential swimming pool filling.
   C.   Residential vehicle washing.
   D.   All inside residential water usage which is not absolutely necessary.
   E.   All commercial water usage which is not absolutely necessary.
   F.   Requested timing adjustments (hours of the day and/or alternative days)
for all of the items listed above.
   G.   Water served at restaurants.
   H.   Washing the streets, parking lots, driveways, and sidewalks.
   I.   Ornamental fountains.
   J.   Hydrant flushing.
   K.   Washing the outside of buildings.
   L.   Nonessential construction water usage.
   M.   Public entity (City, County, school) nonessential water usage.
2.   There may be involuntary required water usage restrictions or complete
prohibitions against the following activities:
   A.   Established residential lawns, gardens, plants, shrubs, and trees.
   B.   Newly planted (less than 5 weeks) residential lawns, gardens, plants,
shrubs, and trees.
   C.   Residential swimming pool filling, private swimming pools, children’s
wading pools, or any other indoor or outdoor pool of any kind or description.
   D.   Residential vehicle washing.
   E.   Commercial vehicle washing establishments.
   F.   Public entity (City, County or school) nonessential water usage.
   G.   Time restrictions (hours of the day and/or days of the week) for any
and all of the items listed above.
   H.   Water served at restaurants.
   I.   Washing streets, parking lots, driveways, or sidewalks,
   J.   Ornamental fountains.
   K.   Hydrant flushing.
   L.   Washing the outside of buildings.
   M.   Construction water usage.
   N.   Tank-load water sales by City.
   O.   Temporary water rate surcharge to curb use.
3.   Each customer may be required to achieve a particular percentage reduction
in water usage as compared to a prior period usage and be subject to the
payment of a premium rate over and above the normal rate in the event such
percentage reduction is not achieved. The amount of percentage reduction and
the base period for comparison purposes shall be established by resolution or
proclamation as previously set forth. The premium rate shall be as set forth in
Section
93.03 of this chapter.
4.   The Council (but not the Mayor or City Manager) may set a base allocation
for every customer of the water system and, if the consumption of a particular
customer exceeds the base allocation, that customer shall pay, in addition to
the regular rate for water consumption, the premium rate set forth in Section
93.04 for unrestrained consumption.
93.03 APPEAL AND ADJUSTMENT.
1.   Base Allocation. In the event that the Council establishes a base
allocation by resolution, any customer of the water system may file an appeal
with the City Manager to adjust the base allocation amount. The City Manager
may grant an adjustment to the appellant based on the following criteria:
   A.   For single-family residential use, the base allocation may be increased
to 200 cubic feet per person per billing period for all individuals residing at
the appellant’s residence for a period of more than 30 days.
   B.   For commercial, industrial, institutional, or other residential use,
the base allocation may be increased based upon facts appropriate to the
individual customer, such as, for example, the average of the water bill during
the previous winter (November through April), production, service, or occupancy
data provided by the customer.
2.   Premium Rate Charges. Any customer may file for adjustment of the premium
rate charges for unrestrained water consumption with the City Manager. The City
Manager may grant an adjustment of the premium rate charges in accordance with
the following criteria:
   A.   The cause of the high consumption must be mechanical in nature (such as
broken or leaky pipes or fixtures) rather than human carelessness or apparent
disregard of this chapter.
   B.   The customer shall furnish proof that the mechanical failure was
repaired promptly. This should be in the form of a licensed plumber’s invoice
or statement or a materials receipt.
   C.   The adjustment may be granted only for the billing period prior to the
correction of the failure.
   D.   For those accounts granted an adjustment of the premium rate charges,
the minimum adjusted premium rate shall be a surcharge of ten percent (10%) of
the normal rate in addition to the normal rate charged to the customer.
93.04 PREMIUM RATE.
At such times as there may be restrictions on consumption which if violated
give rise to a premium rate, the premium rate shall be a ten percent (10%)
surcharge of the normal customer consumption rate in addition to the normal
rate charged to the customer.
93.05 REDUCTION IN FLOW OF WATER TO ANY CUSTOMER.
The City Manager is authorized, after giving notice and opportunity for
hearing, to reduce the flow of water to any customer determined to be using
water in any manner not in accordance with this chapter or a resolution or
proclamation issued pursuant to Section
93.02.
93.06 EXCEPTIONS TO WATER CONSERVATION.
Water reclaimed or recycled after some primary use, such as water that has been
used for washing or cooling, may be used without restriction. Additionally,
water derived from sources other than from the water system, such as water
condensed from the atmosphere by air conditioners or collected from rain or
snow, may be used without restriction.

crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six (6)
inches on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall
rest on firm, solid material at either end.
13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any residence,
business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Building Official. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.

owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at all
times.
96.06 SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Building Official. The public sewer shall be tapped
with a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer
shall be glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the
sewer. At no time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a
manhole unless special written permission is received from the Building
Official and in accordance with the Building Official’s direction if such
connection is approved.
96.07 INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Building Official. As soon as all
pipe work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Building Official shall be notified and the
Building Official shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and
material; no sewer pipe laid under ground shall be covered or trenches filled
until after the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Building
Official refuses to approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed
immediately to correct the work.

When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

5.   Establish and enforce rules to protect and maintain water quality within
the storm water utility system in compliance with water quality standards
established by State, regional and/or Federal agencies as adopted or amended.
100.04 GENERAL POLICIES.
1.   Impact of Construction. The storm water utility charge attributable to a
property shall not change during the course of construction of improvements to
the property. In the event of construction the City shall determine any
modifications to the appropriate charge, which shall be effective upon the
earlier of:
   A.   The issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   B.   Ninety (90) days after construction is halted, provided the
construction is at least 50% complete.
   C.   Ninety (90) days after construction is completed even if a certificate
of occupancy has not been issued.
2.   Measured Uses. The charge shall be on the basis of the actual determined
number of ESUs rounded to the nearest whole number with no limitation.
3.   Parking and Storage Areas. All parking and storage areas whether dirt,
gravel or paved, shall be deemed impervious. A parking area is defined as an
area where motor vehicles are parked on a temporary basis. This shall include
areas such as public or private parking lots.
4.   Roads. Public roads shall not be included in the measurement of impervious
area. All private roads are to be included in the measurement of impervious
areas, except private roads that serve unmeasured uses. A roadway, whether
dirt, gravel, or paved, shall be considered impervious and is defined as the
area intended for the purpose of providing access for motor vehicles.
5.   Storm Water Detention and Retention Facilities. Storm water management
detention and retention facilities shall not affect the calculation of the
storm water utility charge. Storm water detention or retention basins, which
have a surface discharge, shall not qualify the user of the property for any
exemption or modification of the determined storm water utility charge.
6.   Trails and Landscaping Areas. A dirt or gravel area that is not accessed
by motor vehicles or is not otherwise highly compacted shall be considered not
an impervious area. These areas shall include such uses as landscaping and dirt
or gravel areas accessed by only foot traffic or incidental small vehicle
traffic.
100.05 STORM WATER UTILITY CHARGE.
1.   General.
   A.   There is hereby established a storm water utility charge. The charge is
imposed on every user within the City. The charge may be required to be paid in
advance of the provision of the services for the billing period.
   B.   The storm water utility charge shall be imposed on any person who uses
or discharges to the storm water drainage system by:
      (1)   Maintaining impervious surface area connected to either directly or
indirectly and capable of discharge to the storm water drainage system or
surface water management; or
      (2)   Actually discharging storm or surface water into the storm water
drainage system; or
      (3)   Maintaining an unimproved or essentially unimproved property which
contributes water either directly or indirectly to the storm water drainage
system through surface water runoff; or
      (4)   Having property located within the natural drainage boundary of a
floodway or drainage facility owned and operated by the City for purpose of
flood prevention or flood protection.
   C.   All users of property within the boundaries of the City, whether
unimproved property or containing impervious surface area, are presumed to
discharge storm water to the storm water drainage system and to generate a
demand for storm and surface water drainage services unless property is defined
as an exempt property or is specifically determined by any rules promulgated
for the implementation of this chapter to be determined not to discharge
directly or indirectly to the storm water drainage system.
   D.   The minimum storm water utility charge billed shall be 1 ESU.
All storm water utility charges shall be on the basis of a whole number of ESUs
with the ESUs being rounded to the nearest whole number. For properties with an
ESU rounded to zero, the property will not be billed a storm water utility
charge.
   E.   The charge shall be the personal obligation of the user. For purposes
of this chapter the owner of the property shall be the user unless an occupant
of the property other than the owner shall be determined to be the user. This
charge shall constitute a debt due the City as of the date of imposition.
   F.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the real
property as shown on the land records of Carroll County is the occupant and
user.
   G.   Any person who has paid the full amount due in advance for receiving of
service shall be entitled to a refund if the person ceases to be the user. The
refund shall be effective on the date the person is no longer the user and
based on the number of days remaining in the billing period; provided, however,
the refund shall not be effective unless there is a user or party in interest
to assume responsibility for the applicable charge. The refund is waived unless
a written request for refund is on file within thirty (30) days after the date
of vacating or selling the property. The provision for a refund shall not be
applicable unless the period for which the refund is due is greater than 30
days and the amount due for the refund is greater than $5.00.
2.   Rates. Storm water utility charge billed after July 1, 2025.
   A.   The monthly storm water utility charge shall be based on an ESU rate of
$3.10 per ESU.
   B.   The maximum monthly storm water utility charge shall be $51.25 per
account.
   C.   The maximum monthly storm water utility charge for schools shall be
$25.65 per account.
   D.   The maximum monthly storm water utility charge for churches shall be
$10.25 per account.
(Ord. 2507 – Aug. 25 Supp.)
3.   Use Types; Determination of ESUs. For the purpose of this chapter two
types of uses are established:
   A.   Unmeasured Use. An unmeasured use shall be charged at the rate of 1 ESU
per applicable unit.
   B.   Measured Use. Properties that are not classified as unmeasured uses
shall be measured uses. For measured uses the impervious surface area and the
pervious surface area shall be measured. Measurement of the areas shall be
estimated by using one or more of the following: aerial photographs; assessment
records; building permits; construction plans; site visits; ad valorem property
tax records; storm and surface water system connection permits; field surveys;
or other sources deemed reliable by the City. The impervious surface area and
the pervious surface area shall be each multiplied by the respective factor
provided in this chapter. The products of the multiplication shall be added and
divided by the numerical value of one ESU to determine the number of ESUs for
the property. The number of ESUs determined by the division shall be rounded to
the nearest whole number, with said whole number being established as the
number of ESUs applicable for the use.
      Surface Area            Factor
      Impervious            0.85
      Pervious            0.05
4.   User Types; Rate Determination. The storm water utility charge for each
property shall be determined in accordance with the procedure established for
the user type determined appropriate for that property.
   A.   Unmeasured Use.
      (1)   Single-Family Residential Property – Owner Occupied.
      (2)   Single-Family Residential Property – Rental. A single-family
residential property which is not owner occupied.
      (3)   Duplex Residential Property. Each dwelling unit of a duplex
residential property shall be charged as an unmeasured use.
      (4)   Condominiums and Townhomes. Each dwelling unit of a condominium or
townhome development shall be charged as an unmeasured use.
   B.   Measured Use.
      (1)   Multi-Family Residential Property.
         a.   If each dwelling unit of a multi-family residential property has
an account with the City, the total storm water utility charge determined by
measured use shall be divided and billed equally to each dwelling unit with a
minimum billing to each dwelling unit of one ESU.
         b.   If a multi-family residential property has a single account with
the City, the total storm water utility charge shall be billed to that account.
      (2)   Mobile Home Park.
         a.   If each dwelling unit of a mobile home park has an account with
the City, the total storm water utility charge determined by measured use shall
be divided and billed equally to each dwelling unit with a minimum billing to
each dwelling unit of one ESU.
         b.   If a mobile home park has a single account with the City, the
total storm water utility charge shall be billed to that account.
      (3)   Nonresidential Property.
      (4)   Agricultural Property.
      (5)   Unimproved Property.
   C.   Exempt Use. Properties classified as 99% or more pervious area shall be
exempt from any storm water utility charge.
100.06 BILLING, DELINQUENCY COLLECTION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
1.   Billing. The billing procedures for the storm water utility charge shall
be by the City generally as follows:
   A.   The user of a single-family residential property (owner occupied with
an account with the City) shall be billed by the City using such billing
procedures as established by the City and may be billed on the same bill as the
water bill.
   B.   The user of a single-family residential property (owner occupied
without an account with the City) shall be billed by the City using such
billing procedures as established by the City.
   C.   The owner of a single-family residential property (rental) shall be
considered the user for purposes of billing by the City unless at any time
there is a renter or tenant with an account with the City. If said renter or
tenant has an account with the City, the renter or tenant shall be responsible
for the storm water utility charge and may be billed on the same bill as the
water bill. At any time when there is not a renter or tenant with an account
with the City, the owner of the property shall be billed by the City using such
billing procedures as established by the City.
   D.   The owners of other properties for which the owner has an account with
the City may be billed by the City on a periodic basis as determined most
efficient by the City and may be billed on the same bill as the water bill.
   E.   The owners of other properties without an account with the City may be
billed by the City on a periodic basis as determined most efficient by the
City.
   F.   The City shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to every
user in the City subject to the storm water utility charge. Mailing to the
owner of a record as shown on Carroll County's records shall satisfy this
requirement unless there is a designated occupant responsible for payment of
the storm water utility charge.
   G.   The billing period for users with a water meter account with the City
shall be on the basis of the same billing period as for water.
   H.   For all other users, the City shall determine the frequency of the
billing.
   I.   The recipient has fifteen (15) days from the billing date to file a
notice of non-responsibility. The notice shall indicate the relationship of the
recipient to the property and whether on the imposition date of the bill the
property was occupied and if so by whom. Upon receipt of the notice the City
shall determine who is obligated for payment. Based on this determination the
City shall:
      (1)   Issue a new bill to the new user if the property was owned or
occupied by someone other than the original recipient.
      (2)   Reissue the bill to the recipient if it was found that the person
was the responsible party.
      (3)   Issue a bill to the owner as the user if the property was not
occupied, or if the chapter provides that the bill is appropriately issued to
the owner as the party responsible.
The City may take into account any reasonably reliable information available to
it in determining the appropriate party responsible for the billing. Failure to
file the notice so it is actually received by the City within the fifteen (15)
days of the mailing date of the bill shall conclusively establish that the
original addressee was the user on the imposition date.
   J.   It is a violation of this chapter to knowingly provide false
information to the City regarding any fact relating to billing a storm water
utility charge or other charge of the City.
2.   Delinquency Collection, Interest and Penalties.
   A.   Charges imposed under this chapter are deemed delinquent when they are
not paid in full by the date due provided with billing for the charge.
   B.   It is unlawful and a violation of this chapter to maintain a connection
or use the storm water drainage system whether directly or indirectly without
paying the appropriate charges and fees established in this chapter or by any
rule promulgated pursuant hereto. Even if no billing is received, such charges
shall be due and owing and the user is obligated to pay any charges in a timely
fashion.
   C.   Delinquent charges may be collected pursuant to the same procedures as
delinquent water bills.
   D.   Delinquent charges may be recovered by the City in any appropriate
manner.
   E.   The City may impose interest and penalty charges upon delinquent
charges in the same manner as delinquent water charges.
   F.   In addition to remedies provided for collection of a debt, the City may
seek a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting continued occupancy of
property requiring disconnection of the property from the storm water utility
system and termination of water and sewer service to the user’s property.
   G.   In a collection action under this chapter the City shall be entitled to
its costs and reasonable attorney fees including at trial and on appeal if it
is the prevailing party.
   H.   In addition to the right of the City to bring a civil action to collect
any delinquent charges, or enforce any provisions of this chapter, the City may
take any of the following actions to secure payment:
      (1)   The City may refuse to issue any permit to any person who is
delinquent in any payment due under this chapter.
      (2)   The City may terminate provisions for storm and surface water
service to property used by the user.
      (3)   The City may terminate sanitary sewer service to the property used
by the user.
      (4)   The City may terminate water service to the property used by the
user.
100.07 ADOPTION OF RULES.
The City may promulgate pertaining to matters within the scope of this section.
100.08 APPEALS.
1.   The user of any property in receipt of a storm water utility charge under
this chapter may appeal:
   A.   A determination that the property is subject to the storm water utility
charge.
   B.   A determination that the person is obligated to pay the charge imposed
herein.
   C.   Proper classification of the property as an unmeasured use or measured
use.
   D.   A determination of the measured use. In the event of a dispute of the
measured use, the user shall provide written documentation supporting the basis
for appeal.

written decision within thirty (30) days of the filing of the appeal. The
written decision shall set forth the basis of the City Manager’s determination
of the appeal.
4.   In the event the City Manager determines the appeal should result in a
modification of the charge imposed, the person responsible for the charge, or
the measured use, the City shall recalculate and modify the storm water utility
charge as determined under the findings of the appeal.
5.   Any applicant aggrieved by the decision of the City Manager may appeal to
Carroll County District Court by action filed within sixty (60) days after the
mailing of the ruling by the City Manager to the address of the appellant.
6.   The filing of the appeal shall not excuse the payment of the storm water
utility charge when due. However, the City shall refund any portion of the
charge paid subsequent to the filing of the appeal which is adjudged to be
excessive, with interest at the rate provided by law.
7.   Failure to properly exhaust the administrative remedies provided for
herein shall constitute a bar to judicial relief.

105.01 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that solid waste generated within the
City will be collected, transported, and deposited in an environmentally safe
manner and to ensure that the mandated reduction goals set out by the Code of
Iowa will be met.
105.02 FINDINGS.
The City makes the following specific findings:
1.   The collection of solid waste from commercial, industrial, residential,
and other establishments and premises within the City is a matter of serious
concern to the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the City; and
2.   Some solid waste presently being generated within the City is being
transported to its ultimate disposal site in uncovered vehicles which allows
the garbage to fall from the vehicle onto the road during transportation,
thereby littering the road and the property adjoining the road, creating both a
health and safety hazard; and
3.   The mishandling of solid waste from residential, commercial, industrial,
and other establishments and premises in the collection and disposal process
can result in conditions which adversely affect the health, safety, and welfare
of the citizens of the City and may have a serious detrimental impact on the
quality of the environment; and
4.   The collection of solid waste within the City is an essential public
service; and
5.   To better assure compliance with the requirements of Chapters 455B.301a;
455B.302; 455B.307; 455.307a; and 455D.4, it is necessary for the City to
assume the overall responsibility for the collection of all waste generated
within its corporate boundaries and to limit collection of said waste to the
City or to such persons or companies who demonstrate that they are capable and
willing to collect said solid waste in a manner deemed by the City to be
responsible, sound and consistent with the sanitation and environmental
practices and policies established by the State of Iowa and by the City; and
6.   The City has determined that it can best achieve the goals and objectives
of the City as set out in the findings above by one of the following methods:
   A.   City Direct Service. The Council may choose to provide service directly
with City equipment and City employees.
   B.   Selected Hauler Service. The City may designate a zone as a selected
hauler zone. Under this option, the City may receive proposals, on terms
provided by this chapter, for one or a limited number of selected haulers.
   C.   Multiple Contract Hauler Service. The City may determine to offer
standard contracts to haulers, for an initial contract period determined by the
City, under which any qualified hauler may, for the contract period, enter into
a nonexclusive uniform contract with the City to provide some of the City’s
service within the zone. The City may choose to offer contract hauler service
for residential, commercial or industrial service, or any combination of the
three. The City may enter into contracts with multiple haulers for the same
type of service within the same zone.
   D.   A combination of City Service and Private Hauler Service. The City may
determine to provide services directly with City equipment and City employees
for a portion of the waste stream and offer standard contracts to haulers as
outlined in paragraphs B and C above.
7.   The City has a duty to encourage recycling and the proper management of
household hazardous waste.
8.   The City has a desire to ensure that commercial and industrial hazardous
wastes are also collected and disposed of according to Federal and State law.

standard policies which are consistent with the terms of this chapter.
3.   Exception for Transport Through City. This chapter does not prohibit
collectors or haulers of solid waste generated in, or accumulated within, other
cities, counties, or states from transporting such solid waste for disposal
through or to the City in an otherwise lawful manner. This exception does not
relieve such collectors or haulers from complying with other laws governing
such transport or disposal.
4.   Temporary Exemption for Haulers Under Contract with the City. Haulers
under contract with the City as of the date of adoption of the ordinance
codified in this chapter shall be exempt from this chapter during the original

program, in such a manner to best meet the goals for waste stream reduction set
out in Chapter 455B.3 of the Code of Iowa, including encouraging recycling for
residential and nonresidential waste generators.
2.   Prohibited Storage. No person shall place any solid waste in any street,
alley, road, highway or other public place, or upon any private property
(whether owned by such person or not) within the City, except in proper
containers for collection under this chapter, or under express approval granted
by the City, nor shall any person throw or deposit any solid waste in any
stream or other body of water.
3.   Unauthorized Accumulation or Deposit of Solid Waste. The unauthorized
accumulation, deposit or handling of solid waste not otherwise covered by this
chapter or successor ordinance is hereby prohibited. The City may, by written
notification, require the owners or occupants of property to remove any
unauthorized accumulation or deposit of solid waste in the City within a period
not to exceed ten (10) days. If the unauthorized accumulation or deposit of
solid waste is not removed within the specified time, the City may provide for
removal of the accumulation or deposit of solid waste at the owner’s or
occupant’s expense. The City shall then cause the expense to be a lien on the
property and collected as property taxes. This action shall not preclude the
City from seeking civil or criminal penalties from persons responsible for
unauthorized accumulations of deposits of solid waste.
   A.   Proper Storage. No persons shall store solid waste in such a manner
that it may be carried or deposited by the elements upon any public or private
premises. The owner, lessee and occupant of any premises, business
establishment or industry shall be responsible for the satisfactory storage of

any zone will be established by ordinance of the Council, as described in this
chapter.
1.   Service to All Properties. Every property shall receive, and the owner or
occupant thereof shall pay a fee for, collection and disposal of solid waste
and recyclables. Self-hauling of covered solid waste may be allowed, provided
that the collection, transportation and disposal are carried out in accord with
the law and applicable ordinances and in an environmentally suitable manner.
2.   Solid Waste Zones – Service Options. As part of initial passage of the
ordinance codified in this chapter, the Council will establish solid waste
zones for the City. The Council will adopt a service option for each zone. In
determining the appropriate option, the Council will consider the
environmental, economic and geographic circumstances of each zone and will
consider the views of residents and business. The Council may, after notice and
hearing, from time to time adopt revisions in the service option for one or
more zones.
3.   Service Options. In each zone, the Council may adopt any of the following
service options:
   A.   City Direct Service. The Council may choose to provide service directly
with City equipment and City employees.
   B.   Selected Hauler Service. The City may designate a zone as a selected
hauler zone. Under this option, the City may receive proposals, on terms
provided by this chapter, for one or a limited number of selected haulers.
   C.   Multiple Contract Hauler Service. The City may determine to offer
standard contracts to haulers, for an initial contract period determined by the
City, under which any qualified hauler may, for the contract period, enter into
a nonexclusive uniform contract with the City to provide some of the City’s
service within the zone. The City may choose to offer contract hauler service
for residential, commercial or industrial service, or any combination of the
three. The City may enter into contracts with multiple haulers for the same
type of service within the same zone.
   D.   A Combination of City Service and Private Hauler Service. The City may
determine to provide services directly with City equipment and City employees
for a portion of the waste stream and offer standard contracts to haulers as
outlined in paragraphs B and C above.
4.   Regional Cooperation. Upon approval of the Council, the City may enter
into joint powers agreements pursuant to Chapter 28E of the Code of Iowa, or
successor statutes.
105.16 SOLID WASTE ZONES ESTABLISHED.

1.   Residential Zones. The residential zones set out in Appendix A to this
chapter are hereby adopted as the residential collection zones under this
chapter.
2.   Commercial and Industrial Zones. The commercial and industrial zones set
out in Appendix B are hereby adopted as the commercial and industrial zone(s)
under this chapter.
3.   Resolution Determining Method of Collection and Conveyance. The Council
may by resolution establish the mechanism for collection and conveyance of
covered solid waste for each solid waste zone. The City may select any of the
service options described in this chapter and may by resolution establish the
fees applicable to that service.
4.   Different Service Options May Apply to Different Waste Categories. The
City may determine that different categories of covered solid waste will be
collected using different methods of collection in the same zone.
5.   Factors Involved in Determination. In deciding which service option should
be used in a zone, the Council may consider any factors affecting the public
interest, including environmental and public health factors and the expressed
preferences of citizens of the zone. The Council may also consider whether the
selection provides the most economical conveyance and best service.
105.17 CITY DIRECT SERVICE ZONE.
The City may determine that residential or nonresidential collection and
conveyance services, or both, will be provided directly by City employees with
City equipment.
105.18 SELECTED HAULER SERVICE ZONE.
The City may determine that City residential or commercial and industrial
collection and conveyance services, or both, will be provided to the City by
one or more selected private haulers operating under contract with the City;
however, there shall be no more than one hauler operation within each zone for
each type of service.
1.   Solicitation of Hauler Proposals. In a Selected Hauler Service Zone, the
Council will select one or more contract haulers to provide collection and
conveyance services for covered solid waste. The City may award contracts to
selected haulers for periods as specified by the Council. As part of the
process of selecting haulers, the City may solicit proposals for negotiated
contracts from individual haulers. Upon receipt of proposals, the City may
accept one or more of these proposals, or may negotiate with one or more
haulers to obtain new or different terms from those originally proposed by the
haulers. The City may negotiate with potential haulers on price and terms of
service. The contract with any selected hauler may provide that the hauler will
be the only selected hauler for one or more classes of service, or may provide
that there will be a limited number of haulers for one or more classes of
service. Any contract negotiated by the City must be approved by the Council.
2.   Negotiated Reimbursement Rates. The hauler contract may establish hauler
reimbursement rates for commercial, industrial and residential services and the
City shall by ordinance establish rates for residential services. The City may
elect to contract with different haulers for different types of services.
3.   Additional Reimbursement. Hauler contracts may establish separate
reimbursement rates for residential services that are additional to the basic
residential services.
4.   Designation of Customers and Routes. Hauler contracts may provide that
selected haulers will serve all of the customers within the selected route
within the zone, or particular classifications of customers within all or a
portion of the zone.
105.19 MULTIPLE CONTRACT HAULER ZONE.
The City may designate any zone as a Multiple Contract Hauler Zone. In a
Multiple Contract Hauler Zone, the City will provide collection and
transportation services under contract with any qualified hauler who agrees to
enter into a contract specified by the City for a contract term specified by
the City.
1.   City May Limit Classification of Waste Collected. The City may determine
that only certain classifications of covered solid waste may be collected by
multiple contract haulers.
2.   Haulers May Serve Any Customer. Haulers operating under contract to serve
a zone will have an equal right to serve any property within the zone, provided
that, if the contract is limited to a particular classification of covered
solid waste, the hauler may collect only that classification of covered solid
waste. The City may require minimum levels of service, but City contract
haulers may offer differing types and qualities of service from those of other
City contract haulers. Haulers may compete with other City contract haulers to
determine who will serve individual properties.
3.   Rates Paid by City Customer. The multiple hauler contract will provide
that City customers will pay user fees to haulers. Rates charged to City
customers in multiple hauler service zones will be set by haulers, subject to
any limitations which may be set in the contract with the City. Contract
haulers may offer differing charges and schedules of rates.
4.   Procedure for Letting Contracts. From time to time, the City may establish
the contents of contracts applicable to qualified hauler(s) within a zone.
Contracts may be offered for terms specified by the Council. The City may set
contract terms for residential or commercial/industrial service, or any
classification of services.
   A.   Solicitation for Proposal. Prior to offering contracts, the City may
solicit proposals for Multiple Contract Hauler Zone contracts. The City may
enter into negotiations with haulers to set the terms under which haulers will
sign such contracts, and the negotiations may cover price, terms of service,
and such other contract terms as the City may specify.
   B.   Conversion to Selected Hauler Zones. If the City determines that there
is insufficient interest in entering into contracts on a multiple hauler basis,
or the Council determines that the public interest would otherwise be served,
the City may by ordinance convert a Multiple Contract Hauler Zone to a Selected
Hauler Zone and sign contracts with an individual hauler(s) on terms authorized
by this chapter.
105.20 RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL SERVICE.
This section governs the terms of City provided residential and commercial/
industrial service.
1.   Mandatory Service. The owner or occupant of every property shall dispose
of covered solid waste by City provided collection and disposal service, or, if
a self-hauler, ensure that the disposal of covered solid waste is carried out
in an environmentally suitable manner.
   A.   City May Promulgate Regulations. The City may from time to time
establish regulations governing the size and type of containers, requirements
for maintenance of cans, limitation of materials and placement for collection
applicable within one or more solid waste zones. The City may from time to time
establish regulations providing that certain classes of property or waste shall
be handled as nonresidential waste, or shall be subject to special collection
and disposal requirements.
   B.   Recycling Regulations. The City may from time to time establish
regulations governing recycling for residential and commercial/industrial waste
generators.
2.   Minimum Required City Service. The City may establish a minimum level of

district. The City may establish the amount and frequency of service which will
be received by users within the district in return for the minimum service
charge.

payable in a Solid Waste Zone. The fee may vary within the zone according to
location, type of residence, classification of property, volume of covered
solid waste, or other relevant factors.
   B.   Billing. Any service fee payable to the City shall be billed in a
manner established by resolution of the Council.
   C.   Fees for Services Beyond Minimum Required Service. Haulers in any zone
may offer services beyond the minimum level of service required by the City.
Fees for such service may be negotiated between the hauler and the individual
customer.
105.21 UNPAID FEES.
If an owner or any person obligated to pay a service fee owed to the City fails
to pay the fee in the manner prescribed, the City, for itself or on behalf of
its contractors, may recover unpaid fees due under this chapter in any manner
authorized by law, including, but not limited to, the following:
1.   Certification to the County Treasurer. All rates or charges for solid
waste collection services owed to the City, if not paid as provided by this
chapter, shall be a lien upon the property or premises served by any of these
services, upon certification to the County Treasurer that the rates or charges
are due, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 384.84 of the Code of Iowa.
2.   Civil Action. In addition to each and every other remedy available to the
City, unpaid service fees, penalties and interest may be recovered in a civil
action in the name of the City or its Contractor(s).

of this chapter, including any of the service options included in this chapter,
are unlawful or unauthorized by law, this chapter shall nonetheless survive,
and the City shall select service options from the remaining options. If any
court of competent jurisdiction shall rule that the application of any
provision of this chapter is invalid to a particular person or property, such
judgment shall not affect the application of said provision to any other person
or property not specifically included in the judgment.

chapter, or who fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the provisions of
this chapter, or who knowingly makes any false statement in any document
required to be submitted under the provisions hereof, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. Each day that a violation occurs will constitute a separate
offense.
2.   In the event of a violation or a threatened violation of this chapter, the
City, in addition to other remedies, may institute appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent, prosecute, restrain or abate such violation(s) or
threatened violation(s), and it shall be the duty of the City Attorney to
commence such action.

supplying and selling gas to the City and the residents thereof and to persons

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 0808 adopting a natural gas franchise for the City
4 was passed and adopted on June 23, 2008.
   
110.02 MAINS AND PIPES; INDEMNIFICATION.
The mains and pipes of the Company must be so placed as not to interfere
unnecessarily with water pipes, drains, sewers and fire plugs which have been
or may hereafter be placed in any street, alley and public places in said City
nor unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of the same, including ordinary
drainage, or with the sewers, underground pipe and other property of the City,

Company in the laying down, operation and maintenance of said natural gas
distribution system.
110.03 EXCAVATIONS.
In making any excavations in any street, alley, avenue or public place,
Company, its successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in
progress by guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the

purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or
repair of the street or alley or any public improvement of, in or about any
such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any
such improvement. If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its
existing facilities or equipment for the primary benefit of a commercial or
private project, or as the result of the initial request of a commercial or
private developer or other non-public entity, and such relocation is necessary
to prevent interference and not merely for the convenience of the City or other
non-public entity, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such
relocation as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or
equipment. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its
public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this section. The City

Said Company, its successors and assigns, shall throughout the term of the
franchise distribute to all consumers gas of good quality and shall furnish
uninterrupted service, except as interruptible service may be specifically
contracted for with consumers; provided, however, that any prevention of

be a breach of this condition if the Company resumes service as quickly as is
reasonably practical after the happening of the act causing the interruption.
110.06 NONEXCLUSIVE.
The franchise granted by this chapter shall not be exclusive.
110.07 TERM OF FRANCHISE.
The term of the franchise granted by this chapter and the rights thereunder
shall continue for the period of 25 years from the after its acceptance by the

of the 15th anniversary respectively of this franchise. If Company is not
notified of the cancellation by the 15th anniversary, then this franchise shall
continue without cancellation until the 25th year. The Anniversary Date shall
be the date this franchise is filed with the City Clerk or otherwise effective
by operation of law.

project specific basis, detailed maps and information indicating the horizontal
location, relative to the boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment
which it owns or over which it has control and which is located in the project
right-of-way. Mapping information provided shall be for the exclusive use of
the City in the administering the use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way
within the City and shall not be provided to or relied on by any person of any
other purpose. At the request of the City, mapping information will be reviewed
with the City staff. Prior to any excavation by the City, or its agents, in
addition to its responsibilities under the current Iowa One-Call System, or any
successor system, City representatives must contact the Company regarding
current information on the location of underground natural gas lines in the
area concerned. Prior to excavating in the rights-of-way both parties shall
contact and shall follow the procedures therefor of the corporation organized
pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 480 or an entity with a similar function utilized

shared section of map will be for information only, not for construction
purposes, and cannot be reproduced or distributed. Any map or section thereof
provided to City must be returned immediately to Company upon completion of
project. All requests for Company maps must follow Company processes and
applicable State and Federal regulations and protocols.
110.09 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
This chapter sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement between the
Company and the City of Carroll with respect to the rights contained herein,
and may not be superceded, modified or otherwise amended without the approval
and acceptance of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
the City of Carroll enact any ordinance or place any limitations, either
operationally or through the assessment of fees that create additional burdens
upon the Company or which delay utility operations.

111.01   PURPOSE.
Ordinance No. 9506 (City Code Sections
111.01 through
111.07 both inclusive) and all amendments and supplements thereto shall upon
the effective date of this Ordinance be repealed and replaced by this
Ordinance. Upon the effective date of this Ordinance, all prior electric
franchises granted to MidAmerican Energy Company to furnish electric service to
the City and its inhabitants are hereby repealed and all other ordinances or
parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are also hereby repealed.
111.02   FRANCHISE GRANTED.
There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa corporation
(hereinafter called the “Company”), and to its successors and assigns, the
right and non-exclusive franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain, and
operate in the City of Carroll, Iowa (hereinafter called the “City”), a system
for the transmission and distribution of electric energy and communications
signals along, under, over, and upon the public streets, avenues, rights-
of–way, and alleys of the City (collectively “public street” or “public
streets”) to serve customers within the City, and to furnish and sell electric
energy to the City and its inhabitants. The Company is granted the right to
exercise of powers of eminent domain, subject to City Council approval by
resolution. The term “communications signals” refers to Company owned equipment
that is used solely to monitor and communicate the status of the electric
energy system to the Company’s control center. The City Council reserves to
itself the right to extend this franchise to other public places or public
grounds at the request of the Company. This franchise shall be effective for a
twenty (20) year period from and after the effective date of this ordinance;
†5 provided, however, that either the City or the Company may, during the first
ninety (90) days following the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversaries of the
effective date of the franchise, provide written notice to the other party of
its desire to amend the franchise. The parties may negotiate for a period of up
to ninety (90) days following receipt of notice. If, at the conclusion of the
negotiation period, the City determines in good faith that the franchise, if
continued without amendment, will have a material or significant adverse impact
on the City or the Company’s electric customers located within the corporate
limits of the City, the City may terminate the franchise. Failure to amend the
franchise at the first or second date option does not render invalid the City’s
second option or third option to amend or terminate. If neither party requests
such negotiations at year five, year ten, or year fifteen, the franchise will
continue through the conclusion of twenty years from its initial approval date.
111.03   RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the provisions,
restrictions, and limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, as amended
from time to time. Further, the Company shall comply with all applicable
federal, state, and local regulations regarding reporting, including, but not
limited to, those described in
Chapter 113 of the Code of Ordinances of Carroll, Iowa, as amended from time to
time.
111.04   POLES AND WIRES.
The Company shall have the right to erect all necessary poles on public streets
and to place thereon the necessary wires, fixtures, and accessories as well as
to excavate and bury conduits or conductors in public streets for the
distribution of electric energy and communications signals in and through the
City, provided (i) the same shall be placed in accord with this franchise,
ordinances, and policies of the City adopted by resolution or motion of the
Council regarding the placement of equipment, structures, facilities,
accessories, or other objects in public streets, including regulations that
assign corridors or other placements to users of the public streets that may be
adopted regarding separation of structures, facilities, accessories, or other
objects; (ii) the same shall be so placed as not to interfere with any above-
or below-ground utility services or future facilities that have been or known
to be located by or under authority of the City; and (iii) the same shall be
placed, when possible and in accordance with MidAmerican’s Tariff and Iowa
Utilities Board rules, underground. The Company shall comply with all federal
and state regulations regarding joint use of its poles and trenches for
telecommunication carriers as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 1.1402.
111.05   LOCATION AND RELOCATION.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in the Company exclusively or in the Company and other entities), in
accordance with Iowa law, including the Company’s Tariff on file with and made
effective by the Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended
(“Tariff”), at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in, on, over, or under any public street in the City in
such a manner as the City may require for the purposes of facilitating the use,
construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the public street or
other public improvement. If the City has a reasonable alternative route for
the public street or an alternative construction method that would not increase
the City’s cost, would not cause the relocation of Company installations, or
would minimize the cost or expense of relocation of Company installations, the
City and the Company shall work together to consider said alternative route or
construction method. The City shall, in the extension or modification of public
streets, make provision for the placement of Company service lines and
facilities in, on, over, or under those public streets without charge to the
Company. In planning for the extension or modification of public streets, the
City shall to the extent practicable consider design of such changes to limit
the need for relocation of Company facilities. The City shall be responsible
for surveying and staking the public streets for City projects that require the
Company to relocate Company facilities. If requested, the City shall provide,
at no cost to the Company, copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross
section drawings. If tree/vegetation removal must be completed by the City as
part of the City’s project and are necessary whether or not utility facilities
must be relocated, the City, at its own cost shall be responsible for said
removals. If the timing of tree/vegetation removal does not coincide with the
Company’s facilities relocation schedule and the Company must remove trees/
vegetation that are included in the City’s portion of the project, the City
shall either remove the trees/vegetation at its cost or reimburse the Company
for the reasonable expenses incurred to remove said trees/vegetation. If
project funds from a source other than the City are available to pay for the
relocation of utility facilities and if the use of such funds for relocation of
utility facilities does not impact the funds available for the project, the
City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to
compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
111.06   EXCAVATIONS.
All facilities and equipment comprising the Company’s electric distribution
system located in the public streets shall be located so as to cause minimum
interference with the proper use of the public streets and to cause minimum
interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin the public streets. In making excavations in any public streets for the
installation, maintenance, or repair of conductors, conduits, or the erection
of poles, wires, or other appliances, the Company shall not unreasonably
obstruct the use of the public streets. The Company in making such excavations
shall, if required by ordinance, obtain a City permit therefore and provide
City representatives with twenty-four (24) hours advance notice prior to the
actual commencement of the work. In emergencies that require immediate
excavation, the Company may proceed with the work without first providing
advance notice or applying for or obtaining the permit; provided that the
Company shall apply for and obtain the permit as soon as possible after
commencing such emergency work. The Company shall comply with all provisions
and requirements of the City in its regulation of the use of public streets in
performing all work. The Company shall also comply with all City regulations
regarding paving cuts, placement of facilities, and restoration of pavement and
other public infrastructure. In the event of an excavation, the Company shall
replace the surface of the public street, restoring the public street to the
condition as existed prior to the Company’s excavation. However, the Company
shall not be required to improve or modify the public street, or other areas
adjacent to the Company project, to a condition superior to its immediate
previously existing condition, except that any replacement of any surface shall
conform to current City regulations regarding its depth and composition and any
sidewalk replacement shall conform to the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act. The Company shall complete all repairs in a timely manner. In
the event that the Company does not timely comply with its obligations under
this Section after receiving at least forty-eight (48) hours’ notice from the
City, the City may perform the work and recover its cost from the Company upon
notice to the Company.
111.07   UTILITY EASEMENT.
The City’s vacation of a public street shall not deprive the Company of its
right to operate and maintain existing facilities and their replacements on,
below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City abandoning or
vacating any public street where the Company has facilities, the City shall
grant the Company a utility easement for said facilities.   The City shall

across, above, over, under or in any manner connected with public ways within
the service area and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair,
replace, reconstruct, maintain or retain in, on, over, under, upon, across or

services, data services, information and other communications services or for
any other lawful purposes.
112.03 OTHER ORDINANCES.
The Grantee agrees to comply with the terms of any lawfully adopted generally
applicable local ordinance, to the extent that the provisions of the ordinance
do not have the effect of limiting the benefits or expanding the obligations of
the Grantee that are granted by this franchise. Neither party may unilaterally

event of a conflict between any ordinance as of the effective date of the
franchise and this franchise, the franchise shall control.
112.04 OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS.
The City shall not permit any person to provide services similar to those
provided by the Grantee in the service area without first having secured a non-
exclusive franchise from the City. The City agrees that any grant of additional
franchises or other authorizations including OVS authorizations by the City to
provide services similar to those provided by the Grantee pursuant to this
agreement to any other entity shall cover the entire service area and shall not
be on terms and conditions more favorable or less burdensome to the grantee of

less favorable than those contained in any such additional franchise(s) or
authorizations.
112.05 CONDITIONS OF OCCUPANCY.
The cable system installed by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be
located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public
ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own
property that adjoins any such public ways.
112.06 RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
If during the course of Grantee’s construction, operation or maintenance of the
cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the Grantee, the
Grantee shall replace and restore such public way to a condition reasonably
comparable to the condition of the public way existing immediately prior to
such disturbance. Grantee will comply with the City Code of Ordinances Chapter
148 concerning rights-of-way.
112.07 RELOCATION FOR THE CITY.
Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, to be not less than ten (10)
business days, the Grantee shall protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily
disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way any property of the
Grantee when lawfully required by the City by reason of traffic conditions,
public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or
establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water
pipes or any other type of public structures or improvements which are not used
to compete with the Grantee’s services. The Grantee shall in all cases have the
right of abandonment of its underground property, subject to proper disposal
and financial responsibility for abandoned property.
112.08 RELOCATION FOR A THIRD PARTY.
The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a lawful permit issued
by the City, protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate
in or remove from the public way as necessary any property of the Grantee,
provided: (i) the expense of such is paid by the person benefiting from the
relocation, including, if required by the Grantee, making such payment in
advance; and (ii) the Grantee is given reasonable advance written notice to
prepare for such changes. For purposes of this subsection, “reasonable advance
written notice” shall be no less than 30 business days in the event of a
temporary relocation, and no less than 120 days for a permanent relocation.
112.09 TRIMMING OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY.
The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other natural growth in
order to access and maintain the cable system.
112.10 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
Construction, operation and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed
in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in
substantial accordance with generally applicable Federal, State and local
regulations and the National Electric Safety Code.
112.11 UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION.
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise
shall construct, operate and maintain all of its cable system underground.
Nothing contained in this section shall require the Grantee to construct,
operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances.
112.12 ACCESS TO OPEN TRENCHES.
The City agrees to include the Grantee in the platting process for any new
subdivision. At a minimum, the City agrees to require as a condition of issuing
a permit for open trenching to any utility or developer that: (i) the utility
or developer give the Grantee at least ten (10) days’ advance written notice of
the availability of the open trench; and (ii) the utility or developer provide
the Grantee with reasonable access to the open trench. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Grantee shall not be required to utilize any open trench.
112.13 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SYSTEM.
Grantee agrees to provide cable service to all residences in the service area
subject to the density requirements specified in this section. Whenever the
Grantee receives a request for cable service from a potential subscriber in a
unserved area contiguous to Grantee’s existing distribution facilities where
there are at least 10 residences within 1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-
quarter cable mile) from the portion of the Grantee’s trunk or distribution
cable which is to be extended, it shall extend its cable system to such
subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for cable system extension, other
than the published standard/non-standard installation fees charged to all
subscribers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the
service area where another operator is providing cable service, into any
annexed area which is not contiguous to the present service area of the
Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to
extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.
112.14 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does
not meet the density requirements of Section
112.13, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to
subscriber(s) in that area if the subscriber(s) are willing to share the
capital costs of extending the cable system. Specifically, the Grantee shall
contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied
by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet from the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable, and
whose denominator equals 10. Subscribers who request service hereunder will
bear the remaining cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis. The
Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of
construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.
Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/non-standard
installation charges to extend the cable system from the tap to the residence.
112.15 CABLE SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
The Grantee, upon request, shall provide without charge a standard installation
and one outlet of basic cable to those administrative buildings owned or
occupied by the City, fire station(s), police station(s) and K-12 school(s),
and accredited private schools with regular attendance exceeding 50 students
that are passed by its cable system. The cable service provided shall not be
distributed beyond the originally installed outlet without authorization from
the Grantee. The cable service provided shall not be used for commercial
purposes and such outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public. The
City shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any inappropriate use of the
Grantee’s cable system or any loss or damage to the cable system. The City
shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising
out of the provision and use of cable service required by this section. The
Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a
non-standard installation is required, unless the City or building owner/
occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary cable system
extension and/or non-standard installation. If additional outlets of basic
cable are provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the
usual installation and service fees associated therewith.
112.16 EMERGENCY ALERT.
An Emergency Alert System (“EAS”) provided by Grantee shall be operated in
accordance with FCC regulations.
112.17 REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS.
If funds are available to any person using the public way for the purpose of
defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the City shall reimburse the
Grantee in the same manner in which other persons affected by the requirement
are reimbursed. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the
City shall make application for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.
112.18 EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENT ACCESS.
Grantee shall continue to provide the City with one (1) access channel on the
cable system designated for education or government access purposes. Such
channel shall continue to be originated from Carroll Broadcasting, Inc. and
operated by 10 TV.
The Grantee shall provide a second access channel upon written request form the
City. The Grantee shall complete the necessary construction to activate the
channel no later than 6 months from the date of the request if no cable plant
extension construction if required or no later than April 30 of the subsequent
calendar year following the request by the City if a cable plant extension is
required. The channel shall be originated from a location in the service area
as requested by the City. The Grantee shall be responsible for all construction
costs to originate programming for the second access channel up to a maximum
amount of $10,000. The Grantee shall provide the City a one-time capital grant
of $15,000 for capital equipment and facilities for access no later than
January 31 of the calendar year following written request for the second
channel from the City. The access channels are made available to the City by
the Grantee for the purpose of cablecasting non-commercial programming by City
residents, City administration and educational institutions. The City agrees
not to use the access channel to provide commercial or revenue-generating
services or services that may compete, directly or indirectly, with services
provided by the Company, provided, however, that the City may cablecast
acknowledgments of funding sources and the underwriting of programming costs.
112.19 MAPS.
The Grantee shall provide the City with as-built maps of the Grantee’s cable
system in the rights-of-way of the service area upon written request of the
City. The maps shall demonstrate the location of the Grantee’s cable plant to
assist the City in managing the public rights-of-way. The maps shall not
provide proprietary design information or other confidential information.
112.20 FRANCHISE FEE.
1.   The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of three percent (3%) of
annual gross revenues (as defined in Section
112.01 of this chapter). In accordance with the Cable Act, the 12-month period
applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall
be a calendar year. The franchise fee payment shall be due semi-annually and
payable within 90 days after the close of the preceding period. Each payment
shall be accompanied by a brief report prepared by a representative of the
Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
2.   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for recovery
by the City of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three (3) years
from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due to the City.
112.21 RATES AND CHARGES.
The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable and equipment as
expressly permitted by Federal law.
112.22 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
1.   The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the City
that relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and
comply with the provisions of Federal law.
2.   In addition to the procedures set forth in the Cable Act, the City agrees
to notify the Grantee of its assessments regarding the identity of future
cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of
the Grantee under the then current franchise term. The City further agrees that
such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly so that the Grantee
has adequate time to submit a proposal pursuant to the Cable Act and complete
renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its term.
3.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the
Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the then current
franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to
comment in accordance with the provisions of Federal law, the City and Grantee
may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of
the then current franchise and the City may grant a renewal thereof.
112.23 CONDITIONS OF SALE.
If a renewal or extension of Grantee’s franchise is denied or the franchise is
lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the
cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the
cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the
price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the
Cable Act. The Grantee and the City agree that in the case of a final
determination of a lawful revocation of the franchise, the Grantee shall be
given at least twelve (12) months to effectuate a transfer of its cable system
to a qualified third party. Furthermore, the Grantee shall be authorized to
continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise during this
period. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a
qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably
acceptable to the City, the Grantee and City may avail themselves of any rights
they may have pursuant to Federal or State law. It is further agreed that the
Grantee’s continued operation of its cable system during the twelve-month
period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights
of either the City or the Grantee.
112.24 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
The Grantee’s right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without
prior written notice to the City. No such notice shall be required, however,
for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment
of any rights, title or interest of the Grantee in the franchise or cable
system in order to secure indebtedness.
112.25 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION HEARINGS/PERIODIC REVIEWS.
On the fifth and ninth anniversaries of the effective date of the franchise,
the City may require a review of this franchise, subject to the following:
1.   Any such review shall be open to the public and announced in a official
City newspaper. The Grantee shall reasonably notify its local subscribers of
review sessions by announcing same through either public notices or inserts in
subscribers’ billing statements.
2.   Topics to be discussed at any scheduled review session may include, but
will not be limited to, franchise fees; free or discounted services;
application of new technologies; system performance; services provided;
programming offered; customer complaints; privacy; amendments to this chapter;
judicial and FCC rulings; line extension policies; and existing or prospective
rules or regulations of the Grantee or the City.
3.   Members of the general public may add topics by requesting of the City
such topics be added to the agenda of its meeting.
4.   During review or evaluation by the City, the Grantee shall fully cooperate
with the City and shall provide such non-confidential information and documents
as the City may need to reasonably perform the review.
5.   As a result of the review, the City and Grantee may determine that a
change in the terms of the franchise may be necessary, that the cable system or
franchise requirement should be updated, changed, revised or that additional
services should be provided. If the change is consistent with the terms of this
franchise and implementation of the change would not unreasonably add to the
cost of providing cable services, Grantee and the City will change the
agreement upon mutual agreement.
112.26 AUTOMATIC TERM EXTENSION.
The term of this franchise shall be automatically extended for an additional
five years for a total term length of fifteen (15) years if the Grantee is
determined to be in compliance with the material terms and conditions of the
franchise agreement upon completion of the performance review to be completed
on or about the ninth anniversary of the effective date of the franchise. † 6
 
Notes

  City was passed and adopted on April 25, 2005.
112.27 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
The Grantee agrees that the City, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Grantee
and no more than once annually, may review such of its books and records at the
Grantee’s business office, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive
basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this
franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the section of the
franchise which is under review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary
books and records for easy access by the City. Alternatively, if the books and
records are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the
Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of
the City’s representative to view the books and records at the appropriate
location. The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records
for franchise compliance purposes longer than three (3) years. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to
disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or
confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate which
is not providing cable service in the service area. The City agrees to treat
any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose
it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know,
or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required
to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
112.28 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
The Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and
expense, during the term of the franchise. The City shall be designated as an
additional insured and such insurance shall be non-cancellable except upon 30
days’ prior written notice to the City. Upon written request the Grantee shall
provide a Certificate of Insurance showing evidence of the coverage required by
this section.
112.29 INDEMNIFICATION.
The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless and defend the City,
its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages
and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury
(including accidental death) which arise out of the Grantee’s construction,
operation or maintenance of its cable system in the service area, provided that
the City shall give the Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify
the City within ten (10) days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this
section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify the
City for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct
or negligence of the City.
112.30 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with any
material term of the franchise, the City shall informally discuss the matter
with Grantee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem,
the City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged
noncompliance.
112.31 GRANTEE’S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND.
The Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice described in
Section
112.21 to: (i) respond to the City contesting the assertion of noncompliance;
or (ii) to cure such default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of the
default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty-day period, initiate
reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being
taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
112.32 PUBLIC HEARING.
In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice as described in
Section
112.30 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
112.31, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within thirty
(30) days or the date projected pursuant to Section
112.31(iii) above, if it intends to continue its investigation into the
default, then the City shall schedule a public hearing. The City shall provide
the Grantee at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice of such hearing, which
specifies the time, place and purpose of such hearing and provide the Grantee
the opportunity to be heard.
112.33 ENFORCEMENT.
Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the event the City, after the
hearing set forth in
112.32, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of the
franchise, the City may:
1.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief; or
2.   In the case of repeated or ongoing substantial noncompliance with a
material term or terms of the franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in
accordance with Section
112.34.
112.34 REVOCATION.
Should the City seek to revoke the franchise after following the procedures set
forth in Sections
112.30 –
112.33, the City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent. The
notice shall set forth the exact nature of the repeated or ongoing substantial
noncompliance with a material term or terms of the franchise. The Grantee shall
have 60 days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for
such objection. In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response
from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public
meeting. The City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least thirty
(30) days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time
and place of such meeting and stating its intent to revoke the franchise. At
the designated hearing, Grantee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full
participation, including the right to be represented by legal counsel, to
introduce relevant evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel
the relevant testimony of the officials, agents, employees or consultants of
the City, to compel the testimony of other persons as permitted by law, and to
question witnesses. A complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of
such hearing. Following the hearing, the City shall determine whether or not
the franchise shall be revoked. If the City determines that the franchise shall
be revoked, the City shall promptly provide Grantee with its decision in
writing. The Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court,
which shall have the power to review the decision of the City de novo. Grantee
shall be entitled to such relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal
must be taken within sixty (60) days of the Grantee’s receipt of the
determination of the City. The City may, at its sole discretion, take any
lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the
franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.
112.35 FORCE MAJEURE.
The Grantee shall not be held in default under or in noncompliance with the
provisions of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to
noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred
or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the Grantee to
anticipate and control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting
for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which
Grantee’s cable system is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/
or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. Furthermore, the parties
hereby agree that it is not the City’s intention to subject the Grantee to
penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of
the franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or
minimal negative impact on the subscriber within the service area, or where
strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the
Grantee which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the City and/or
subscribers.
112.36 ACTIONS OF PARTIES.
In any action by the City or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under
the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely
manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required
under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
112.37 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
This franchise constitutes the entire agreement between the Grantee and the
City and supersedes all other prior understandings and agreements oral or
written. Any amendments to this franchise shall be mutually agreed to in
writing by the parties.
112.38 RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
Acceptance of the terms and conditions of this franchise will not constitute,
or be deemed to constitute, a waiver, either expressly or impliedly, by Grantee
of any constitutional or legal right which it may have or may be determined to
have, either by subsequent legislation or court decisions. The City
acknowledges that Grantee reserves all of its rights under applicable Federal
and State Constitutions and laws.
112.39 NOTICE.
Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response
required by this franchise to be served upon the City or the Grantee shall be
in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party
when placed in a properly sealed and correctly addressed envelope: (i) upon
receipt when hand delivered with receipt/acknowledgment; (ii) upon receipt when
sent certified, registered mail; (iii) within five business days after having
been posted in the regular mail; or (iv) the next business day if sent by
express mail or overnight air courier. The City and the Grantee may designate
address or addresses from time to time by giving notice to the other in the
manner provided for in this section.
112.40 TERM.
The franchise shall expire ten (10) years from the date of final adoption by
the City, unless extended by the mutual agreement of the parties.

113.01 PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The Council finds it is necessary for the City to establish uniform rules and
controls to ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by
the City and others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for
the delivery of utility or other services, in order to protect public and
private investment, ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the
health, safety and welfare of the population, to provide for the regulation and
administration of the public streets and other public property and secure the
rights of the City to a return on its investment in public property. This
chapter is to be interpreted in light of these findings for the benefit of the
public and users of the streets and other public property.
113.02 FRANCHISE, LICENSE OR LEASE REQUIRED.
No person or other entity shall excavate or obstruct the public right-of-way or
other public property for the delivery of utility or related services without
first obtaining a franchise, license or lease from the City. The City shall not
enter into or issue any franchise, license or lease that grants exclusive
rights. An application for a license or lease shall be filed with the City
Clerk on a form provided by the City and shall include as a minimum the
following information: the name, address and telephone number of the applicant;
the name, address and telephone number of a person whom the City may notify or
contact at any time concerning the license or lease; an engineering site plan
showing the proposed location of the facilities including any manholes, the
size, type and proposed depth of any conduit or other enclosures; and any
additional information the City may require. No license or lease required by
this section shall be granted by the Council if the proposed use of public
right-of-way or property would endanger public safety or not conform to
standard engineering practices concerning placement or separation distances
from other facilities in said right-of-way or public property.
113.03 FEES.
1.   Definitions. The following terms are defined for use in this section:
   A.   “Management costs” means the reasonable cost the City actually incurs
in managing public rights-of-way.
   B.   “Public right-of-way” means the area on or below a public roadway,
highway, street, bridge, cartway, bicycle lane, or public sidewalk in which the
City has an interest, including other dedicated rights-of-way for travel
purposes and utility easements. A public right-of-way does not include the
airways above a public right-of-way in regard to cellular or other non-wired
telecommunications or broadcasts service or utility poles owned by a local
government or municipal utility.
   C.   “Public Utility” means a person owning or operating a facility used for
furnishing natural gas by pipe distribution system, electricity, communication
services not including cable television systems, or water by pipe distribution
system, to the public for compensation.
2.   The City shall not recover any fee from a public utility for the uses of
its right-of-way, other than a fee for its management costs. The City may
recover from a public utility those management costs caused by the public
utility’s activity in the public right-of-way. A fee or other obligation under
this section shall be imposed on a competitively neutral basis. When the City’s
management costs cannot be attributed to only one entity, those costs shall be
allocated among all users of the public rights-of-way, including the City
itself. The allocation shall reflect proportionately the costs incurred by the
City as a result of the various types of uses of the public right-of-way.
3.   This section does not prohibit the collection of a franchise fee. If the
City collects a franchise fee from an entity pursuant to Section 364.2(4) of
the Code of Iowa, under an existing or future franchise, the City shall not
also collect a management fee from that entity under this section.
4.   In addition to the payment of the management costs, the franchisee,
licensee, or lessee shall pay for all City costs when there is an excavation of
a right-of-way. These costs shall include all City construction costs, costs
for street degradation and replacement, obstructing and routing of pedestrian
and vehicle traffic and $5.00 per square foot or fraction thereof for any
concrete or asphalt cut.
5.   All or part of these costs may be waived if work is done in conjunction
with City construction.
113.04 LIMIT ON TERM.
No franchise, license or lease for use of the public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted for a term of more than twenty-five (25)
years.
113.05 PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
The facilities, fixtures and equipment of the distribution, transmission or
sale of any utility services, or services provided under franchise, license or
lease or easement, shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or
unreasonably interfere with the travel on the streets, highways, avenues,
alleys, bridges and public places in the City, nor shall such facilities,
fixtures and equipment interfere with the proper use of the same, including,
but not limited to, ordinary drainage, or the functioning of the sewers,
underground pipe or other property of the City. In the event that facilities,
fixtures and equipment of any person or other entity located within a public
right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road construction or road
reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction, or the construction
or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public works or the
construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any City-owned utility,
such relocation, at the written request of the City, shall be completed by the
owner of such facilities at the owner’s cost. The City shall upon request of
any person or other entity holding a franchise, license or lease, review any
plans for the construction of facilities, fixtures and equipment within the
public right-of-way and advise the person or other entity of any conflict such
construction may have with planned or anticipated public improvements, but
failure of the City to so advise such person or other entity will not relieve
the owner of such facilities of its obligations under this chapter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Public Works Director may require
placement of equipment or facilities belonging to any holder of a franchise,
license or lease be limited to locations designated by the Public Works
Director if such limitation is deemed by the Public Works Director to be
necessary to protect the integrity or use of present and future users of the
public right-of-way or other public property.
113.06 INDEMNIFICATION AND BOND.
The holder of any franchise, license or lease shall indemnify and hold the City
harmless at all times during the term of the franchise, license or lease from
and against all claims for injury or damage to any person or property,
including payments under workers’ compensation laws, caused by the
construction, erection, operation or maintenance of its facilities, fixtures or
equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its employees. In case of
any suit or action at law being commenced against the City, upon any claim for
damage arising out of any loss, injury or damage claimed to have been caused by
any installation, improvement, obstruction or excavation made or left in, under
or upon such street, sidewalk, alley or public place by the holder of a
franchise, license or lease, its agents, contractors or employees, upon being
notified in writing by the City of such action or proceeding, the holder of
said franchise, license or lease shall appear and make proper defense thereto
at the expense of the holder of the franchise, license or lease; and if any
judgment or decree shall in any such case be rendered against the City therein,
the holder of said franchise, license or lease shall assume, pay and satisfy
such judgment or decree, with the cost thereof. Immediately upon issuance of
the franchise, license or lease, the holder of the franchise, license or lease
shall purchase general liability insurance. The amount of insurance shall be a
minimum of $1,000,000 with a maximum deductible of $5,000. The holder of the
franchise, license or lease shall file with the Clerk a certificate of
insurance which clearly discloses on its face coverage in conformity with these
requirements. Upon request of the City, the holder of the franchise, license or
lease shall submit a certified copy of the policy.
113.07 REGULATION BY THE CITY.
The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the use
of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically
provided shall apply to any holder of a franchise, license or lease.
113.08 CONSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION.
A written permit will be obtained from the Public Works Director whenever it
becomes necessary for the holder of any franchise, license or lease to excavate
in streets or public grounds of the City. Such permits shall state a particular
part or point of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length
of time in which such permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception
to a requirement for a permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving
public safety, in which case a permit will be obtained at the earliest
opportunity after the work has started. In making excavations in the streets,
the holder of any franchise, license or lease shall proceed with such work as
to cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. The holder of any
franchise, license or lease shall properly protect, according to safety
standards generally accepted at the time of placement, as may be determined
from time to time by the Public Works Director, all excavations and
obstructions by proper placement of shoring, surface plates, barricades,
warning lights and such other or additional devices as circumstances may
warrant. If in the opinion of the Public Works Director, such excavation or
obstruction is not properly and safely protected, the Public Works Director,
shall notify such holder of a franchise, license or lease who shall immediately
comply with such reasonable instructions. Immediately after use, any trenches
for excavations which the holder of a franchise, license or lease has opened
shall be filled. However, no trench or excavation in the streets shall be
filled or covered without giving the City the right to inspect the same. All
backfilling in streets will be according to City specifications. Temporary
street surfacing will be placed in such excavations as soon as the same has
been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or other portions of
streets and public places opened, disturbed or damaged shall be promptly
restored and replaced with like materials at the expense of the holder of a
franchise, license or lease and left in as good condition as before the
opening, disturbance or damage occurred. In the event like replacement
materials are not available, the holder of the franchise, license or lease
shall notify the Public Works Director who must approve the use of any
alternate materials. In the event that the holder of a franchise, license or
lease fails to comply with the provisions of this section, after having been
given reasonable notice, the City may do such works as may be needed to
properly repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or other portions
of streets and public places and the cost thereof shall be repaid to the City
by the holder of the franchise, license or lease. In cases where a cut or
disturbance is made in a section of street paving or sidewalks, but causes
greater disturbance than to just the area cut, rather than replace only the
area cut, the holder of a franchise, license or lease shall replace that area
as may be ordered by the Public Works Director, which in no event shall exceed
the panel or panels disturbed.
113.09 CITY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING.
Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade
line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct any
conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer or other City-owned
public works or City-owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any
franchise, license or lease, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its
service lines and other property in the streets or other public places at its
own expense so as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or
public place and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so
constructed or reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements,
including but not limited to urban renewal projects, the City may require the
holder of a franchise, license or lease to relocate its poles, service lines
and appurtenances in the streets at the owner’s expense. The City may at its
discretion assign personnel for inspection of excavation and related work being
performed by the holder of a franchise, license or lease. Should the holder of
the franchise, license or lease fail or refuse to do and perform the things
provided in this section, the City may, after reasonable notice, perform the
work and charge the expense thereof to the holder of the franchise, license or
lease and the holder of the franchise, license or lease shall promptly pay said
charges.
113.10 DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY.
The holder of a franchise, license or lease shall promptly, upon request,
furnish the Public Works Director a detailed map or maps of its distribution
system both within the City limits and the area within two miles surrounding
the City. The holder of a franchise, license or lease shall thereafter update
the map or maps at least annually or upon request, showing all subsequent
additions or deletions to the distribution system. Prior to any excavation by
the City or its agents, a representative must contact the holder of any
franchise, license or lease regarding current information on the location of
underground lines or facilities in the area concerned. The obligation to
contact the holder of a franchise, license or lease under this section shall be
satisfied if contact is made with a corporation organized pursuant to Chapter
480 of the Code of Iowa or an entity with a similar function utilized by both
the City and the company, currently the Iowa One-Call System.
113.11 ABOVE-GROUND CABLES, WIRES, CONDUITS AND POLES.
After enactment and publication of the ordinance codified by this chapter, all
cables, wires and conduits shall be placed underground except where above-
ground connection to buildings or other locations above ground is reasonably
necessary. Such above-ground connection shall be by means of poles located, as
far as reasonably practical, within alleys. No such poles shall be installed or
erected until the Public Works Department has approved the proposed location,
construction and pole heights.
113.12 ASSIGNMENT.
No sale or assignment of any franchise, license or lease of the use of the
public right-of-way or other public property shall be effective until it is
approved by the Council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office of
the Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition
assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the City shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee or lessee shall similarly
file an instrument, duly executed, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms
of the franchise, license or lease and agreeing to perform all of the
conditions thereof.
113.13 FORFEITURE.
The violation of any material portion of a franchise, license or lease by the
holder thereof or its successors or assigns, or its failure promptly to perform
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of said
franchise, license or lease and the termination of all rights thereunder. Such
forfeiture shall be accomplished by written notice to the holder thereof and
failure or default specified on the notice within thirty (30) days from the
date the notice was served.
113.14 APPLICATION.
This chapter shall apply to all franchises, licenses or leases and easements
granted by the City, including all existing franchises, licenses or leases and
easements.
113.15 HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforceable against the holder of any franchise, license or lease.
113.16 NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any franchise, license or lease, developments within
the filed for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the
opportunity to effectively, efficiently and economically serve its customers
through use of a substance or material other than those for which the grant was
originally made, then the holder of the franchise, license or lease may
petition the Council which, with such requirements or limitation as it deems
necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of
such substance or material under the terms and conditions of the franchise,
license or lease.

of bike paths and combination bike paths/pedestrian walkways maintained by the
city, shall remove snow, ice and accumulations from sidewalks within a
reasonable time but in no case more than twenty four (24) hours following the
cessation of the weather or other event by which they were deposited, provided,
however, that in extraordinary weather circumstances the director of public
works, building official or police chief or their designated representative may
extend the period of time provided herein. In those situations, the director of
public works, building official or police chief or their designated
representative will deliver to news media a statement indicating the amount of
additional time property owners shall have to remove accumulations from
sidewalks.
   B.   If accumulations are not removed as required above, including any
extraordinary weather circumstances, or required treatment pursuant to
subsection 5 is not completed and maintained, the building official or chief of
police or their designated representative may give to the property owner a
notice entitled "Official Notice - Failure to Remove Snow or Ice Accumulation
on Sidewalk and/or Failure to Treat Snow and/or Ice Accumulation on Sidewalk"
setting forth the location/address of the violation and to whom the notice is
directed with the explanation of the violations. This notice shall be
personally served upon the owner of the residence. If personal service is not
possible, written notice of such violation shall be affixed to the front door
of the premises. If the owner is leasing or renting the premise, the tenant
shall be personally served or notice affixed to the front door and the owner
shall also be personally served with the notice. The owner of the property in
violation shall have twenty-four (24) hours from the time of service or posting
of this notice in which to take corrective action and bring the sidewalk into
compliance with this code. The existence of extraordinary weather conditions as
determined by the director of public works, building official or police chief,
pursuant to this subsection, shall extend the twenty-four (24) hours until such
extraordinary weather conditions have dissipated. Upon notification by the
public works director, building official or police chief of the end of
extraordinary weather conditions the twenty-four (24) hours will start. If
after notice, the accumulations are not timely removed or the required
treatment pursuant to subsection 5 is not completed and maintained, the police
chief or their designated representative is authorized to issue a civil
citation pursuant to section 364.22 of the code of Iowa.
   C.   A second subsequent violation of this section shall not be considered a
repeat offense pursuant to section 364.22, Code of Iowa, for the purposes of
increasing the civil penalty provided in said code section, unless the prior or
preceding offenses have occurred within the current snow season.
5.   Treatment of Unremovable Snow and/or Ice. When accumulations have formed
upon any sidewalk so that it cannot be reasonably removed, the abutting
property owner shall within the period set forth in subsection 4 of this
section keep and maintain such accumulations sprinkled with fine cinders, sand
or de-icing chemicals in such manner as to provide traction and prevent the
sidewalk from being dangerous to persons using the same. Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to be a substitute for the removal of
accumulations, as required in subsection 4 of this section. This subsection
shall only apply when accumulations cannot be reasonably removed, however, all
accumulations shall be removed as soon as practical.
6.   Unlawful Deposit of Snow and/or Ice. No person shall remove, or cause to
be removed, accumulations from private premises and deposit the same or cause
the same to be deposited upon any public street, avenue, alley, public square
or traveled area within the city. The chief of police or their designated
representative is authorized to issue a civil citation pursuant to section
364.22 of the code of Iowa to anyone violating this subsection indicating said
person is in violation of this subsection and is subject to the penalties
provided for in section 364.22, the code of Iowa.
7.   Removal By The City of Carroll. Whenever accumulations have remained on
any sidewalk in violation of subsection 4 and/or whenever unremovable
accumulations have formed on any sidewalk in violation of subsection 5, and the
time for the property owner to take action after service of the notice has
expired, the city may cause such accumulations to be removed and/or treatment
of unremovable accumulations either by use of city personnel and equipment or
by contracting for the work to be undertaken.
8.   Right to Assess. When the city removes or causes to be removed
accumulations and/or treats accumulations, the city may assess the actual cost
plus any administrative costs of removing such accumulations from the abutting
property owners' sidewalks and/or treatment of unremovable accumulations, in
addition to taking any other action provided for in this section.
9.   Assessment of Costs. The actual cost of removal and/or treatment of
accumulations, including an administrative cost of seventy-five dollars ($75)
per occurrence, shall be paid by the owner of the property abutting thereon.
The property owner shall be sent an itemized bill by the city for said costs to
permit voluntary payment thereof by the property owner. The bill shall be sent
within thirty (30) days of the city's action as set forth in subsection 8 of
this section. Failure to pay said bill within thirty (30) days after mailing of
bill will cause the action to appear on a schedule of assessments to be
forwarded to the City Clerk.
10.   Schedule of Assessments. Whenever any accumulations have been removed
from any sidewalks or treatment of the sidewalks for unremovable accumulations
by the city as provided in this section, and the right to assess provided for
in subsection 9 is invoked, the city shall cause to be prepared a schedule
giving the name of the owner, so far as known, a description of the property,
the date when the work was done, and the amount charged to each lot, and for
what work and materials the charge was made. As soon thereafter as practicable
the schedule shall be filed with the City Clerk.

145.04 NOTICE TO OWNER.
The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement

The purpose of this chapter is to establish the authority of the City with
regard to the type of construction of signs located within the City and for
sign regulations that are intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable
communication between people. The regulations recognize the need to protect the
safety and welfare of the public, the need for well maintained and attractive
signs in the community, and the need for adequate public and business
identification, advertising, and communication. These regulations do not
attempt to regulate design or copy content of any permitted sign. However, a
great percentage of that which is unattractive can be eliminated by sensible
quality control, through adequate maintenance and inspection and by reasonable
guidelines formulated to minimize clutter.

158.05 INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.
1.   Authority. The Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to administer and
enforce the provisions of the Rental Housing Code and to make inspections to
determine the conditions of all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units,
structures, and premises located within the City, in order that the Code
Enforcement Officer may perform the duty of safeguarding the health, safety,
and welfare of the occupants of dwellings and of the general public under the
provisions of this chapter.
2.   Inspection of Rental Units. Inspection of rental units shall be conducted
upon request, on a complaint basis, and/or through a program of regular rental
inspections which program shall not be conducted more frequently than yearly or
less frequently than the set schedule indicated below:
 
Single family dwelling                         Every 3 years
Duplex                                         Every 3 years
Owner-occupied plus more than 2 dwelling units Every 3 years
Multiple dwelling units                        Every 3 years
Rooming houses                                 Every 3 years
 
The provisions of Sections
158.07 through
158.09 of this chapter shall apply to the inspections of all rental units.
As an incentive to encourage property owners to maintain their properties, if
on the first inspection a Single family dwelling has only one deficient item, a
duplex or a triplex building has only one deficient item in the entire
building, or a four plex or larger building has only one deficient item in no
more than 25% of the units, then the frequently of regular reinspection shall
be set as indicated in the schedule below and the annual rental housing permit
fee shall be 60% of the normal rate annually for the next 5 years:
 
Single family dwelling                         Every 5 years
Duplex                                         Every 5 years
Owner-occupied plus more than 2 dwelling units Every 5 years
Multiple dwelling units                        Every 5 years
Rooming houses                                 Every 5 years
 
If a unit becomes vacant and it has been at least 20 months from the last
inspection of that unit an owner may, but the owner is not required to, request
the City complete a regular inspection while the unit is vacant to avoid future
disruption of the tenant.
3.   Access by Owner or Operator. Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit,
or rooming unit shall give, upon proper notice, the owner or operator thereof,
or any authorized agent or employee, access to any part of such dwelling,
dwelling unit, rooming unit, or premises at all reasonable times for the
purpose of effecting such maintenance, making such repairs, or making such
alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with, or any lawful notice or
order issued pursuant to the provisions of Sections
158.07 through
158.09.
4.   Access by the Code Enforcement Officer. Whenever authorized to make an
inspection or whenever the Code Enforcement Officer has reasonable cause to
believe that there exists any condition in violation of any provisions of this
chapter or in response to a complaint that an alleged violation may exist, the
Code Enforcement Officer may enter such unit or premises during reasonable
times to inspect and perform any action authorized by this chapter. If such
unit or premises is tenant-occupied, the Code Enforcement Officer shall also
notify the owner or other persons having charge or control of the building or
premises of the requested entry. The Code Enforcement Officer shall at such
times present official identification and explain why entry is sought; and if
entry is refused, the Code Enforcement Officer shall request that the
inspection be conducted at a reasonable time, suitable to the owner or
occupant. If the request for future entry is refused, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall at that time, or at a later time, explain to the owner and/or
occupant that said owner and/or occupant may refuse, without penalty, entry
without a search warrant, and the Code Enforcement Officer may apply to the
Iowa District Court for an administrative search warrant pursuant to Section
1.12, Carroll Code of Ordinances and Section 88.14 Iowa Code.
5.   Administrative Search Warrant. If consent to inspect a building is
withheld by any person having the lawful right to exclude, the Code Enforcement
Officer may apply to the Iowa District Court in and for Carroll County for an
administrative search warrant of the building. No owner or occupant or any
other person having charge, care, or control of any dwelling, dwelling unit,
rooming unit, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after presentation
of an administrative search warrant, to properly permit entry therein by the
Code Enforcement Officer for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant
to this chapter.
6.   Violation Notice. Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer determines, upon
the basis of an inspection or other reliable information, a premises has one or

variance in the application of the Housing Code to your particular
circumstances. Failure to file a timely appeal results in waiver of your right
to have this order modified.
You are further advised that your failure to comply with this order (or as it

the City Code.
 
The order set out in this subsection shall be served upon the owner personally,

appeal, also request additional time to move.
You are further advised that this order to vacate may be judicially enforced and
that the occupancy or sufferance of occupancy of the affected premises after the
expiration of the thirty (30) day period provided herein without a valid rental
permit constitutes a municipal infraction per Chapter 4 of the City Code.
 
The above notice and order shall be served upon the owner and tenant
personally, upon a member of the owner’s and tenant’s family (if that person is

the rental permit for the premises and the owner may cause the premises to be
re-occupied by the different tenants. The owner and/or tenant may appeal the
notice and order by filing a written notice of appeal with the Housing Appeals
Board within seven (7) days of this service of the notice. The issue on appeal
is solely limited to the issue of whether the previous order to repair, correct
and comply (or as it may have been modified on a previous appeal) has been
complied with and may not address matters concerning such order which were
subject to previous appeal rights. However, tenants may, by filing a timely
appeal, also request additional time to move. The order to vacate may be

sufferance of occupancy of the affected premises after the expiration of the
thirty-day period provided herein (or after such additional time as the Housing
Appeals Board may have granted a tenant to move) without a valid rental permit
constitutes a municipal infraction as defined in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.

You are hereby ordered to vacate the above premises within 48 hours of your

order.
You are advised that this order may be appealed by filing a written notice of
appeal containing the reasons for appeal with the Housing Appeals Board, City
Hall, Carroll, Iowa, within twenty-four (24) hours of your receipt hereof. The
appeal may dispute the above code violations but it may not request additional
time for compliance, nor will the filing of an appeal act to delay the deadline
for vacating the premises.
You are further advised that this order to vacate may be judicially enforced and
your failure to comply with this order (or as it may be modified on appeal)
constitutes a municipal infraction per Chapter 4 of the City Code.
 
The above notice and order shall be served upon the owner and tenant
personally, or by phone, fax, or e-mail (due to the urgency of the emergency
order) if immediate personal service cannot be accomplished after reasonable
attempts and by posting the copy thereof in a conspicuous place in or about the
dwelling affected by the notice and order. The owner may appeal the order by
filing a written notice of appeal with the Housing Appeals Board within twenty-
four (24) hours of the service of the order. The sole issue on appeal is the
cited violation. Time to comply or vacate may not be an issue on an appeal of
the order, nor will the filing of an appeal extend the number of days before
the premises must be vacated. The Code Enforcement Officer, upon issuing an
emergency order to vacate, shall post upon the dwelling a placard designating
the dwelling as unfit for human habitation. No dwelling which has been
placarded shall again be used for human habitation until a written approval is
secured from and such placard is removed by the Code Enforcement Officer. The
Code Enforcement Officer shall remove such placard whenever the violation upon
which the placarding action was based has been eliminated. No person shall
deface or remove the placard from any dwelling which was the subject of an
emergency order to vacate and placarded as such. An emergency order to vacate
may be judicially enforced and a violation of the emergency order to vacate and
the occupancy or sufferance of occupancy of the affected premises after the
expiration period provided in the order constitutes a municipal infraction as
defined in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.
158.06 HOUSING APPEALS BOARD.

the Board) consisting of five (5) members of which 4 shall be residents of the
City of Carroll, who do not hold an elective office in the municipal
government, and who are appointed by the Mayor subject to the approval of the
Council. Members should come from a diverse background such as a rental
property owner, a tenant, an individual engaged in a construction trade, and a
non-rental property owner. Members are appointed for staggered terms of five
(5) years. If any vacancy exists on the Board caused by resignation or
otherwise, a successor shall be appointed for the remainder of the term.
2.   Compensation. All members of the Board shall serve without compensation
except for their actual expenses accrued, which shall be subject to the
approval of the Council.

one of its members to act as Chairperson of the Board, and another of its
members as Vice Chairperson, who shall perform all the duties of the
Chairperson during his or her absence or disability. The Board may also choose
one of its members to act as Secretary or choose a non-board member to act as
Secretary, who shall record all minutes and proceedings of the Board and who
shall be responsible for filing same in the office of the Housing Appeals
Board.
4.   Jurisdiction. Any person affected by a written notice and/or order issued
under this chapter which is specifically subject to appeal, may appeal to the
Board by filing a written appeal specifying the grounds therefor within the
time limits provided. Appeals shall include requests for additional time and
variances allowed under this chapter. The filing of an appeal does not delay
the time for compliance with a notice or order unless the Board fails to
determine the matter within the time limit provided for compliance with the
notice or order in which case such time for compliance shall automatically be
extended to the time such determination is made except in the instance of an
emergency order.
5.   Procedures.
   A.   The Board, upon receipt of a written appeal, shall set a time and place
for the hearing. The applicant shall be advised, in writing, of such time and
place at least seven (7) days prior to the date of the hearing. At such a
hearing the appellant shall have an opportunity to be heard and to show cause
as to why such notice or order should be modified, extended, revoked, or why a
variance should be granted. The Board, by a majority vote, may sustain, modify,
extend, or revoke a notice or order and grant or deny a variance.
   B.   The Board may grant additional time for compliance with a notice or
order where specifically recognized by this chapter. However, the Board may, by
an express determination, retain jurisdiction of a matter concerning additional
time and make tentative extensions to be finally determined at a later date and
time by the Board. In the event that additional time or tentative extensions
are granted, the Board shall make specific findings of fact based on evidence
relating to the following:
      (1)   That there are historical or practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in carrying out the strict letter of any notice or order; and
      (2)   That such additional time or a tentative extension is in harmony
with the general purpose and intent of this chapter in securing the public
health, safety, and general welfare. Except under extraordinary circumstances,
the grant of additional time, including the sum of tentative extensions shall
not exceed twelve (12) months.
   C.   The Housing Appeals Board may grant a variance in a specific case and
from a specific provision of this chapter subject to appropriate conditions;
and provided the Board makes specific findings of fact based on the evidence
presented on the record as a whole, and related to the following:
      (1)   That there are historical or practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in carrying out a strict letter of any notice or order; and
      (2)   That due to the particular circumstances presented, the effect of
the application of the provisions would be arbitrary in the specific case; and
      (3)   That an extension would not constitute an appropriate remedy for
these practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in this arbitrary effect;
and
      (4)   That such variance is in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter in securing the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   D.   Upon appeal or the request of the Code Enforcement Officer, the Board
may consider the adoption of a general variance. The Board by a majority vote
may establish a general variance for existing structures which cannot
practicably meet the standards of the Rental Housing Code. Prior to considering
any general variance, public notice shall be given. A general variance, if
granted, shall:
      (1)   State in what manner the variance from the specific provision is to
be allowed; and
      (2)   State the conditions under which the variance is to be made; and
      (3)   Be based upon specific findings of fact based on evidence related
to the following:
         a.   That there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
carrying out the strict letter of the specific provision, common to dwellings,
dwelling units, or rooming units to which the variance will apply, and
         b.   That such variance is in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter in securing the public health, safety and general
welfare.

160.04 City May Repair                      160.08 Penalty
 
160.01 EMERGENCY REPAIR ZONE.
The Public Works Director or the City Manager or the City Council may designate
a particular portion of a public improvement of the City as an “Emergency
Repair Zone.” This designation may be by written notice from the Public Works
Director or City Manager or resolution of the City Council. The term “Public
Improvement” is intended to include streets, sidewalks, storm sewers, sanitary
sewers, water systems, and any other “public improvement” as that term is
defined in Section 384.37 of the Code of Iowa or as defined in Section 364.12
as a “public place.”
160.02 DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY REPAIR ZONE.
The declaration of the Emergency Repair Zone by the Public Works Director or
City Manager or City Council shall be based upon the judgment of the Public
Works Director, City Manager or City Council. It is the intent of the City that
such emergency repair zones include but not be limited to:
1.   Situations involving undue risk of harm to members of the public;
2.   Rapidly deteriorating damage to public improvements that cannot await the
normal resolution of necessity repair process provided in Chapter 384 of the
Code of Iowa; or
3.   Such other emergencies as may threaten public or private property in the
City.
160.03 NOTICE.
Notice of the designation of such an emergency repair zone shall be given to
the adjacent property owners in the best possible manner under the
circumstances. If the emergency is such that notice and hearing are impossible,
the City may proceed with the emergency repairs and shall consider the
impossibility or difficulty of giving advance notice in assessing the costs.
Where possible, notice will be given in writing to affected property owners who
will have an opportunity for hearing before the Council, before the City
Manager, or before the Public Works Director, prior to such emergency repairs.
160.04 CITY MAY REPAIR.
After the designation of an emergency repair zone, and after such notice and
hearing as may be possible under the circumstances, the City may proceed with
the emergency repair of the public improvement or public grounds. In
undertaking the repair, the City may require the abutting property owners to
perform a reasonably related action such as a connection to public drainage
systems, public sewer systems, removal, repair or dismantling of a dangerous
building or structure, removal or abatement of a nuisance, or other actions as
set out in Section 364.12 of the Code of Iowa.
160.05 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
If the nature of the emergency repair permits advance notice and hearing, and
if in the discretion of the Council the matter should be the subject of special
assessments for the cost of repair, the assessment cost may be paid in up to
ten (10) annual installments in the same manner and with the same interest
rates provided for assessments against benefitted property under Chapter 384 of
the Code of Iowa. If a special assessment is so levied, it will be a lien
against the benefitted property from the date of filing the schedule of
assessments until the assessment is paid. Such special assessments shall have
equal precedence with ordinary taxes and are not divested by judicial sale.
160.06 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS.
In addition to or in lieu of the special assessment, the City may seek
reimbursement for costs incurred for performing any act authorized by this
chapter by a civil action for damages against a property owner who fails to
comply with the specified actions as stated herein. The City may also seek
equitable remedies including an order for injunction or abatement in the event
of noncompliance by abutting property owners.
160.07 SUPERVISION AND NOTIFICATION REQUIRED.
Abutting property owners who are required by the emergency repair zone
designation to take actions to repair structures, connect to City systems, or
abate dangerous or nuisance situations shall undertake such action under the
general supervision of the City. No connection to a City system shall be
undertaken without notifying the City Public Works Director of the time, date,
and manner of such proposed connection, with such notice to be sufficiently in
advance to allow the Public Works Director to supervise such connection,
repair, or abatement. Any such connections to City systems shall be with
acceptable quality of materials and workmanship. Any excavations must be marked
with barricades and warning lights under the supervision of the City Public
Works Director. Where applicable, installations must comply with City and State
building or plumbing codes. Should any such connection, abatement, or repair
not be completed by the abutting property owner within reasonable time, or any
such excavation be left open or partly open for more than a reasonable time,
the City shall have the right to finish or correct the work and the City shall
assess the property owner.
160.08 PENALTY.
In addition to or in lieu of the remedies available to the City under this
chapter, the City may charge a municipal infraction against any property owner,
whether a person or business, who would fail to comply with actions required by
this chapter. For the first infraction, a civil penalty of $50.00 will be
assessed. For the second infraction, a civil penalty of $100.00 will be
assessed. For a third and any subsequent offense, a civil penalty of $200.00
will be assessed. Each day such infraction exists or continues may be
considered a separate infraction.

161.09 NOISE AND EMISSION STANDARDS.
1.   Noise. No equipment shall be operated at towers and telecommunications
facilities so as to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under
WAC 173-60, except during emergencies or periodic routine maintenance which
requires the use of a back-up generator, where the noise standards may be
exceeded temporarily.
2.   Emissions. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the FCC sole
jurisdiction to regulate radio frequency emissions. Facilities that meet the
FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of emissions
impacts. Applicants for tower sites shall be required to provide information on
the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC
standards.
161.10 PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES AND RELATED LEASE FEES.
The placement and maintenance of communications antennas or towers on City-
owned sites, such as water towers and parks, will be allowed when the following
additional requirements are met.
1.   Water Tower or Reservoir Sites. The City’s water towers represent a large
public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves.
Therefore, their protection is of prime importance. As access to the City’s
water storage system increases, so does the potential for contamination of the
public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of communications towers
or antennas on water towers sites will be allowed only when the following
requirements are met:
   A.   The applicant must have written approval from the Public Works Director
each time access to the facility is desired. This will minimize the risk of
contamination to the water supply.
   B.   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to
accommodate the applicant’s facility.
   C.   The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower
maintenance cost to the City.
   D.   The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health or
safety of the workers maintaining the water tower.
The following fees will be assessed for placing facilities on a City water
tower: $500.00 initial installation and $1,000.00 per month thereafter.
2.   Parks. The presence of certain communications antennas or towers
represents a potential conflict with the purpose of certain City-owned parks
and recreational facilities. Towers shall be prohibited in designated
conservation areas. Communications antennas or towers will be considered only
in the following parks after the recommendation of the Parks and Recreation
Director and approval of the Council.
   A.   Public parks of a sufficient scale and character that are adjacent to
an existing commercial or industrial use.
   B.   Commercial recreational areas and major ball fields.
   C.   Park maintenance facilities.
Fees for placing facilities on park property: $1,000.00 initial installation
and $2,000.00 per month thereafter.
161.11 ABANDONMENT.
In the event the use of any communications tower has been discontinued for a
period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the City Manager who
shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the
communications tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. Upon
such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 180
days within which to: (i) reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower
to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or (ii) dismantle
and remove the tower. At the earliest, 181 days from the date of abandonment,
without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any special
exception and/or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire.
161.12 TERMINATION.
The Council may terminate any lease if it is determined that any one of the
following conditions exist.
1.   A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use.
2.   A user’s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users of
higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately
predicted in the technical analysis.
3.   A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the City’s lease agreement.
Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the intended
termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a hearing
before the Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be
followed in emergency situations.
161.13 HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforced against the holders of any lease.
161.14 NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any lease, developments within the field for which
the grant was made to the holder of the lease present the opportunity to the
holder of the lease to be more effective, efficient and economical through the
use of a substance or material other than those for which the lease was
originally made, the holder of the lease may petition the Council which, with
such requirements or limitations as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substance or material
under the terms and conditions of the lease.

165.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.   Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter
364, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any
power and perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the
rights, privileges and property of the City or of its residents, and to
preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of its residents.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
3.   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the
rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve
and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of
its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in Section
165.01(2)(A) of this chapter with provisions designed to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
165.02 DEFINITIONS.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
1.   "Appurtenant Structure" means a structure which is on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
2.   “Base flood” means the flood having one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. (See 100-year flood.)

165.03 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands and uses which have
significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for Carroll
County and Incorporated Areas, City of Carroll, Panels 19027C0134C, 0142C,
0151C, 0153C, 0161C, 0162C, dated September 15, 2017, which were prepared as
part of the Carroll County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify
such flood hazard areas and all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries
of the 100-year flood shall be considered as having significant flood hazards.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the precise location of the 100-year
flood boundary, the location shall be determined on the basis of the 100-year
flood elevation at the particular site in question. The Flood Insurance Study
is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for the
purpose of administering flood plain management regulations.
(Ord. 1706 - Sep. 17 Supp.)
165.04 COMPLIANCE.
No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located,
extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations which apply to uses
within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
165.05 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provision of this chapter shall prevail. Any
ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
165.06 INTERPRETATION.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of
the Council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers
granted by State statutes.
165.07 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The standards required by this chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the designated areas
of significant flood hazard will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
165.08 GENERAL FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and shall
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where 100-year flood data
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether the land involved is
either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the
100-year flood level. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
1.   All Development. All development within the areas of significant flood
hazard shall:
   A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
   C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to
flood damage.

governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
2.   Residential Buildings. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the 100-year flood level. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers) may be allowed, subject to favorable consideration by the City
Council, where existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude
elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support
the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated
with flooding. All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of
access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.
3.   Nonresidential Buildings. All new or substantially improved nonresidential
buildings shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum
of one foot above the 100-year flood level, or together with attendant utility
and sanitary systems, be flood-proofed to such a level. When flood proofing is
utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State shall certify that
the flood proofing methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths,
pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated
with the 100-year flood; and that the structure, below the 100-year flood
level, is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to National Geodetic Vertical Datum) to which any structures are
flood-proofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
   A.   Fully enclosed areas below the “lowest floor” (not including basements)
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.

grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and
low damage potential storage.
   B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
   C.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
5.   Factory-Built Homes.
   A.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one foot above the
100-year flood level.
   B.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
   A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
   B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into floodwaters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
   C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities other than on-site systems shall be provided with a level
of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood
elevation.
   D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7.   Flammable or Explosive Materials. Storage of equipment and materials that
are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood
level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or: (i)
not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
floodwaters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
8.   Levees and Floodwalls. Flood control structural works such as levees,
floodwalls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a 100-year flood
with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the 100-year flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50
lots (whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for those
areas located within the area of significant flood hazard.
11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
   A.   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental to
a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements where
the following criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential.
Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet. Those portions of the structure
located less than 1 foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-resistant
materials.
      (2)   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
      (3)   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      (4)   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,

provisions of Section 165.08 (4) A of this Ordinance.
   B.   Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
(Ord. 1706 - Sep. 17 Supp.)
12.   Recreational Vehicles.
   A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Section
165.08(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days, and
      (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
   B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Section
165.08(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
13.   Pipelines. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried in the
streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due
to channel degradation and meandering.
165.09 SPECIAL FLOODWAY STANDARDS.
In addition to the general flood plain standards, uses within the floodway must
meet the following applicable standards. The floodway is that portion of the
flood plain which must be protected from developmental encroachment to allow
the free flow of floodwaters. Where floodway data has been provided in the
flood insurance study, such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no
floodway data has been provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to provide a floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible
for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination.
1.   No use shall be permitted in the floodway that would result in any
increase in the 100-year flood level. Consideration of the effects of any
development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal
degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
2.   All uses within the floodway shall:
   A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.

must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
8.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
9.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
165.10 ADMINISTRATION.

unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other
structures, mining, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations) including the placement of factory-built homes.
165.12 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
Application for a flood plain development permit shall be made on forms
supplied by the Administrator and shall include the following information:
1.   Work To Be Done. Description of the work to be covered by the permit for
which application is to be made.
2.   Location. Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done
(i.e., lot, block, tract, street address or similar description) that will
readily identify and locate the work to be done.
3.   Use or Occupancy. Indication of the use or occupancy for which the
proposed work is intended.
4.   Flood Elevation. Elevation of the 100-year flood.
5.   Floor Elevation. Elevation (in relation to National Geodetic Vertical

165.13 ACTION ON APPLICATION.
The Administrator shall, within a reasonable time, make a determination as to
whether the proposed flood plain development meets the applicable standards of
this chapter and shall approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals,
the applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefor.
The Administrator shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by
the Council.
165.14 CONSTRUCTION AND USE TO BE AS PROVIDED IN APPLICATION AND PLANS.
Flood plain development permits, issued on the basis of approved plans and
applications, authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth
in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State, that the finished fill, building floor
elevations, flood proofing, or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the
use or occupancy of any structure.
165.15 VARIANCES.
The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from
the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest,
where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet
the following applicable standards:
1.   Cause. Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
2.   Prohibited. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result.
Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based
upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for
similarly situated lands.
3.   Required To Afford Relief. Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
4.   Notice to Applicant. In cases where the variance involves a lower level of
flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00
of insurance coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
5.   Approval. All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of
the Department of Natural Resources.
165.16 FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES SHALL BE BASED.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream to
the injury of others.
3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these
systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
6.   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
7.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the
proposed use.
8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood
plain management program for the area.
10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment

170.08   APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.  
The regulations set by this chapter within each district are minimum
regulations and apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, and
particularly, except as hereinafter provided:
1.   No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no
building or structure or part thereof shall hereinafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in conformity
with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
2.   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered to
exceed the height, to accommodate or house a greater number of families, to
occupy a greater percentage of the lot area, or to have narrower or smaller
rear yards, front yards, side yards, or other open spaces, when herein
required, or in other manner contrary to the provisions of this chapter.
3.   No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading
space required under or in connection with any building for the purpose of
complying with this chapter, shall be included as a part of a yard, open space
or off-street parking or loading space similarly for any other building.
4.   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall be

Yards or lots created after the effective date of this chapter shall meet at
least the minimum requirements established by this chapter.
5.   Not more than two (2) buildings shall be permitted on any lot, tract, or
parcel of land until the same has been platted in accordance with the laws of
the State of Iowa; and, no principal building shall be permitted on any lot
formed by the process of dividing a lot of record or putting together pieces or
parts of platted lots of record except pursuant to a special use permit issued
by the Zoning Board of Adjustment after notice mailed to all owners and
occupants of land within two hundred feet of the site, hearing, and finding
that issuance of the permit will not contribute excessively to any adverse
effect on infrastructure, city services, traffic and parking, or property
values in the locale. Special protective conditions may be imposed and the
Board shall call for and consider the evaluation and opinions of the City’s
professional staff in making its decision.
6.   No building in the rear of any principal building on the same interior lot
shall be used for residence purposes, except as may be otherwise specifically
provided in this chapter.

170.09   HOME OCCUPATIONS.
1.   Statement of Intent. Within the various districts as described, certain
uses are permitted as they are mutually compatible. It is the intent of this
chapter to restrict incompatible uses; however, it is not the intent of this
chapter to eliminate certain home occupations which may be compatible with
residential areas. Home occupations are hereby permitted and defined as
business, occupation, or profession carried on within a residential dwelling by
a resident thereof, and shall have the following characteristics:
A.   There shall be no exterior advertising other than identification of the
home occupation by a sign which shall be attached to the dwelling and shall not
exceed one square foot in area which shall not be illuminated.
B.   There shall be no emission of smoke, dust, odor, fumes, glare, noise,
vibration, electrical or electronic disturbance at or beyond the property line.
C.   The activity shall employ in the home only members of the immediate family
of the residents of the dwelling.
D.   The use shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the
dwelling purposes and shall not change the character thereof.
E.   There shall be no mechanical equipment used except as is customary for
domestic household purposes.
F.   There shall not be any activity so as to cause parking and/or traffic
problems annoying to the public. A home occupation shall provide additional
off-street parking area in accordance with this Ordinance.
G.   The above listed characteristics shall not be construed to restrict the
sale of garden produce on the premises, provided this exception shall not
extend to allow the operation of a commercial greenhouse or nursery, or the
existence of stands or booths for the display of produce grown on the premises.
H.   No more than four rummage or garage sales are permitted per year at any
one residence.
2.   Permit Required. Home occupations shall be permitted as special use under
the general use regulations of the zoning district. A special use permit
therefore must first be obtained by application to the Zoning Board of
Adjustment. The Board may grant such permit if it reasonably concludes from the
evidence that the home occupation proposed will meet the standards set out in
the first paragraph of this section. The Board may, if warranted by the
evidence, impose, as additional conditions, such measures as may be deemed
necessary to protect the legitimate use and enjoyment of neighboring
properties. Any failure to obtain such permit when required, or to comply with
the standards and conditions aforesaid, when issued, shall constitute a
violation of this section and shall furthermore be ground for revocation of
said permit, after notice and hearing by the Board of Adjustment.
3.   Permit Revocation. Home occupations shall be permitted as an accessory use
subject to the above requirements. If a written complaint is filed with the
Building Official by a property owner within a radius of 300 feet of the
property, a public hearing before the Board shall be required to determine the
continuance of the home occupation.
4.   Permit Possession. Possession of the Home Occupation Permit shall rest
with the property owner and not the property, and is non-transferable.
170.10   NON-CONFORMING USE OF LAND, NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES AND NON-
CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
1.   Statement of Intent. Within the various districts established by this
chapter or its amendments there exist structures and uses of land with or
without structures which are lawful or vested non-conforming uses prior to the
adoption of this chapter in its amendments, but which would be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the provision of this chapter. It is the intent
of this chapter to permit those non-conformities to continue even though they
are incompatible with the district in which they are located so long as
provisions hereinafter set forth are complied with. It is the general intent of
this chapter to restrict non-conformities so that compatibility of land use and
zoning will prevail.
2.   Non-Conforming Uses of Land. The lawful use of land upon which no building
or structure is erected or constructed, which is a vested non-conforming use
under this and prior zoning ordinances as adopted or amended, may be continued
as long as such use remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
A.   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land.
B.   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot or parcel.
C.   No structure or building shall be constructed on or moved onto the land,
unless the use is changed to a use permitted in that district.
D.   If any non-conforming use of land ceases for any reasons for a period of
one (1) year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the district
regulations for the district in which such land is located.
3.   Non-conforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of vested non-
conforming use of a structure and land in combination exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment to these regulations, that would not be allowed
in the district under the terms of these regulations, the use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
A.   No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not permitted
by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged,
extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, unless the use is
changed to a use permitted in the district in which the structure is located,
or this it is not enlarged or altered in anyway which increases the degree or
nature of its non-conformity, and, provided that any enlargement or addition
shall conform to current zoning regulations. Should the structure causing a
non-conforming use be destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty percent
(60%) or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, exclusive of
the foundation, it shall not be reconstructed.
B.   Any vested non-conforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time it
became non-conforming. No such use shall be extended to any land outside such
building.
C.   If no structural alterations are made, a vested non-conforming use of a
structure may be changed to another non-conforming use of a similar nature or a
more restrictive classification. Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed
to one of a more restrictive classification, or to a conforming use, such use
shall not thereafter be changed to one of a less restrictive classification.
Any proposed change or addition in usage of a non-conforming structure must
first be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Such review shall
consider such features as similarities of use, character of use, traffic
generation, and other applicable features. A recommendation shall be forwarded
to the Zoning Board of Adjustment for review and determination if the proposed
use is of a similar nature or one of a more restrictive classification. The
Board of Adjustment shall then approve or disapprove the proposed use.
4.   Non-Conforming Structures. Where a vested non-conforming structure is non-
conforming by reasons of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or
other characteristics of the structure and its location on the lot, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
A.   That it is not enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-
conformity, and provided that such enlargement or addition conforms in all
respects to existing zoning regulations.
B.   Should it be destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty percent (60%) or
more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, exclusive of the
foundations, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
C.   Maintenance and Repair to vested Non-conforming Structures. Nothing in
this section shall prohibit the maintenance and repair of vested non-conforming
structure to keep such structures in sound and safe condition, provided that no
structural enlargement, extension, alteration, or change shall be made to
increase the degree of non-conformity.
5.   There may be change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing
non-conforming use of land, structure, or land and structure providing there is
not a change in the nature or character of said non-conforming use.

relationship between various types of uses, be maintained and that the zoning
standards as set forth in this ordinance and statutes concerning light and air,
recreation and open space, and building coverage by preserved. It is the intent
of the City of Carroll that the planned residential development be encouraged
for areas of the community, as appropriate, in particular those areas of the
community now undeveloped and those areas which in time would be annexed to the
City.
2.   Permitted Uses. Normal permitted uses are those of a residential character
including single-family (detached or attached), two family and/or multiple
family dwellings, and the usual accessory buildings, such as garages, storage
space, maintenance structures, and buildings for recreational purposes.
Commercial uses, limited to those specifically approved by the City Council,
are permitted provided that such uses are primarily for the service and
convenience of the residents of the development. Such commercial users are
encouraged to be located within the residential buildings, however, if such
uses are proposed to be contained within a separate freestanding structure:
A.   It must be so designed to reflect the residential character of the
development; and,
B.   It may contain an identification sign no more than four square feet,
placed flush on one wall and generally not observable from the periphery of the
development.
No building permit for a free-standing commercial structure will be issued and/
or no certificate of occupancy for commercial use of any residential structure
will be issued until 60 percent of the development's dwelling units have been
issued a certificate of occupancy.
3.   Minimum Requirements.
A.   Open Space Requirements. A major portion of any PUD is its open space. The
desirability is closely tied to the integration of open space with the total
development. A minimum of 20 percent of the land area shall be retained for
common open air recreational uses and other usable open space. Quality
standards acknowledge the separate and multiple functions of open space, active
recreation, passive recreation and preservation of natural site amenities. In
designing a PUD, consideration shall be given to such functions. The term open
spaces shall not include space devoted to streets and parking. All land in the
PUD indicated as common land and common open space shall be maintained by one
of the following methods:
(1)   If the land is deeded to a Homeowner's Association (HOA), the developer
shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the
association, to be submitted with the application for the PUD. The provisions
shall include, but not be limited to:
a.   The HOA must be set up before the dwellings are sold.
b.   Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any successive buyer.
c.   The open space restrictions must be permanent.
d.   The HOA must be responsible for liability insurance, taxes, and the
maintenance of recreational and other facilities.
(2)   All or any part of the open space system may be conveyed to the City of
Carroll by joint agreement of the developer and City. Such conveyance may be by
dedication or easement.
B.   Yard Requirements. The minimum lot and yard requirements of the
conventional zoning districts in which the development is located shall not
apply, except that minimum yards specified in the conventional district for
suitable screening or buffering shall be provided around the boundary of the
development. In the absence of any appropriate physical barrier, the Council
may require open space or screening be located along all or a portion of the
development boundary. While the minimum yard requirements of the conventional
zoning district in which the development is located do not apply, a minimum
distance of ten feet between buildings shall be observed.
C.   Maximum Density. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted in a
“P.U.D.” development district shall be determined by dividing the net
development area by the following maximum densities:
 
Zoning Classification Maximum Density
R-1                   7,500 sq. ft. per unit
R-2                   Single family detached dwelling unit - 5,600 sq. ft. per
                      unit; All other units - 3,700 sq. ft. per unit
R-3                   Single family detached dwelling unit - 4,500 sq. ft. per
                      unit; All other units -2,800 sq. ft. per unit
R-4                   Single family detached dwelling unit -3,600 sq. ft. per
                      unit; All other units - 1,900 sq. ft. per unit
R-5                   Single family detached dwelling unit - 3,600 sq. ft. per
                      unit; All other units - 1,500 sq. ft. per unit
Net development area shall be determined by subtracting from the gross
development area any area proposed for streets.
If the development contains two or more zoning district classifications, the
number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined by adding the maximum
dwelling units allowable for each proportional part, but the dwelling units may
be located within the development irrespective of the conventional zoning
district classification of any particular area. However, if the development
area includes land zoned “F-1”, maximum of thirty (30) percent of such land may
be used in determining the number of development units that can be built within
the entire development. No dwelling shall be placed on land zoned “F-1” in a
“P.U.D.” development.
D.   Tract Size. The minimum size tract for a P.U.D. is two acres.
E.   Height Limitations. There shall be no maximum height requirement. However,
height shall be regulated to the extent that it relates to the proposed
development and to the general area within which the development is proposed to
be located.
F.   Other Considerations. A number of major factors should undergo evaluation
as a portion of design standards. These include:
(1)   Natural drainage areas shall be retained as appropriate and, if
necessary, improved.
(2)   Due consideration shall be given to preserving natural site amenities and
minimizing the disturbance to the natural environment.
(3)   Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The location of the
trees is to be considered in designing building locations, underground
services, and paved areas.
(4)   If the development includes flood plain areas, they shall be preserved as
permanent open spaces.
(5)   Due consideration shall be given to the natural topography and major
grade change shall be avoided. If the development includes hillsides and
slopes, special evaluation shall be given to geological conditions, erosion,
and topsoil loss. If unfavorable development conditions exist, the City Council
may restrict clearing, cutting, filling, or other substantial changes in the
natural conditions of the affected area.
4.   Supplementary and Bulk Regulations. No part of an area required for the
purposes of complying with the provisions of this section shall be included as
an area required for another lot.
5.   Off-Street Parking Requirements. Two parking spaces per single unit
dwelling and two parking spaces per unit for two or more unit dwellings; and
for all other permitted uses as required in Section
170.34.
6.   Review Application Procedure. The reviewing and processing of any proposed
P.U.D. shall be in two steps.
A.   Pre-Application Conference. Prior to any application for P.U.D. plan
approval, contact shall be made with the Planning Division, Department of

171.01 DEFINITIONS.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
1.   “Airport” means the Arthur N. Neu Municipal Airport.
2.   “Airport elevation” means the highest point of an airport’s usable landing
area measured in feet above mean sea level, which elevation is established to
be 1,204 feet.
3.   “Airport hazard” means any structure or tree or use of land that would
exceed the Federal obstruction standards as contained in 14 CFR 77.21, 77.23,
and 77.25, and that obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft
and landing or takeoff at an airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing
or taking off of aircraft.
4.   “Airport primary surface” means a surface longitudinally centered on a
runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary
surface extends two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of that runway. The
width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in Part
77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach
existing or planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point
on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the
runway centerline.
5.   “Airspace height” means, for the purpose of determining the height limits
in all zones set forth in this chapter and shown on the zoning map, sea level
elevation unless otherwise specified.
6.   “Control zone” means airspace extending upward from the surface of the
earth, which zone may include one or more airports and is normally a circular
area of five (5) statute miles in radius, with extensions where necessary to
include instrument approach and departure paths.
7.   “Instrument runway” means a runway having an existing instrument approach
procedure utilizing air navigation facilities or area type navigation
equipment, for which an instrument approach procedure has been approved or
planned.
8.   “Minimum descent altitude” means the lowest altitude expressed in feet
above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or
during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument
approach procedure, where no electronic glide slope is provided.
9.   “Minimum en route altitude” means the altitude in effect between radio
fixes which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets
obstruction clearance requirements between those fixes.
10.   “Minimum obstruction clearance altitude” means the specified altitude in
effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airways routes, or route
segments which meets obstruction clearance requirements for the entire route
segment and which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within
twenty-two (22) miles of a VOR.
11.   “Runway” means a defined area on an airport prepared for landing and
take-off of aircraft along its length.
12.   “Visual runway” means a runway intended solely for the operation of
aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument
approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA approved
airport layout plan, military services approved military airport layout plan,
or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority.
171.02 AIRPORT ZONES AND AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby created
and established certain zones that are depicted on the Arthur N. Neu Municipal
Airport Height Zoning Map. A structure located in more than one zone of the
following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitations. The various zones are hereby established and defined as
follows:
1.   Horizontal Zone. The land lying under a horizontal plane 150 feet above
the established elevations, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of
Runways 13 and 31, and 5,000 feet for Runways 3 and 21, and connecting the
adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. No structure shall exceed 150
feet above the established airport elevation in the horizontal zone, as
depicted on the Arthur N. Neu Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
2.   Conical Zone. The land lying under a surface extending outward and upward
from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 feet to one for a
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. No structure shall penetrate the conical
surface in the conical zone, as depicted on the Arthur N. Neu Municipal Airport
Height Zoning Map.
3.   Approach Zone. The land lying under the surface longitudinally centered on
the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end
of the primary surface.
(Note: An approach surface is applied to each end of each runway based upon the
type of approach available or planned for that runway end.)
   A.   The inner edge of the approach surface is:
      (1)   250 feet wide for Runways 3 and 21.
      (2)   500 feet wide for Runways 13 and 31.
   B.   The outer edge of the approach zone is:
      (1)   1,250 feet for Runways 3 and 21 (visual utility runways).
      (2)   3,500 feet for Runways 13 and 31 (non-precision instrument with
visibility minimums more than ¾ statute mile).
   C.   The approach zone extends for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet at a
slope of 34 to one for Runways 13 and 31 (non-precision instrument with
visibility minimums more than ¾ statute mile); and 5,000 feet at a slope of 20
to 1 for Runways 3 and 21 (visual utility runways).
No structure shall exceed the approach surface to any runway, as depicted on
the Arthur N. Neu Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
4.   Transitional Zone. The land lying under those surfaces extending outward
and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline
extended at a slope of seven to one from the sides of the primary surface and
from the sides of the approach surfaces. No structures shall exceed the
transitional surface, as depicted on the Arthur N. Neu Municipal Airport Height
Zoning Map.
5.   Increase in Elevation of Structures. No structure shall be erected in the
County that raises the published minimum descent altitude for an instrument
approach to any runway, nor shall any structure be erected that causes the
minimum obstruction clearance altitude or minimum en route altitude to be
increased on any Federal airway in the County.
171.03 USE RESTRICTIONS.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of
171.02, no use may be made of land or water within the City or County in such a
manner as to interfere with the operation of any airborne aircraft. The
following special requirements shall apply to each permitted use:
1.   Lighting. All lights or illumination used in conjunction with streets,
parking, signs or use of land and structures shall be arranged and operated in
such a manner that it is not misleading or dangerous to aircraft operating from
the Municipal Airport or in the vicinity thereof.
2.   Visual Hazards. No operation from any use shall produce smoke, glare, or
other visual hazards within three statute miles of any usable runway of the
Municipal Airport.
3.   Electronic Interference. No operation from any use in the City or County
shall produce electronic interference with navigation signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft.
171.04 LIGHTING.
Notwithstanding the provisions of
171.03, the owner of any structure over two hundred (200) feet above ground
level must install on the structure lighting in accordance with Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), Advisory Circular 70-7460-1D and amendments.
Additionally, any structure constructed after the effective date of this
chapter† 8  (August 14, 1978) and exceeding 949 feet above ground level, must
install on that structure high intensity white obstruction lights in accordance
with Chapter 6 of FAA Advisory Circular 7460-1D and amendments. Any permit or
variance granted may be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure
or growth in question to permit the City or County at its own expense to
install, operate, and maintain thereto such markers or lights as may be
necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airspace hazard.

171.05 VARIANCES.
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or to
permit the growth of any tree, or to otherwise use property in violation of any
section of this chapter, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for variance from
such regulations. No application for variance to the requirements of this
chapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the
application has been submitted to Municipal Airport Zoning Commission for an
opinion as to the aeronautical effects of such a variance. If the Municipal
Airport Zoning Commission does not respond to the Board of Adjustment within 15
days from receipt of the copy of the application, the Board may make its

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
EDITOR’S NOTE
Ordinance No. 8403 entitled “The City of Carroll, Iowa, Subdivision
Regulations,” adopted February 13, 1984, and amendments thereto, contained in a
separate volume, are a part of this Code of Ordinances, and have been
specifically saved from repeal and are in full force and effect. The following
ordinances have been adopted amending Ordinance No. 8403.
ORDINANCE ADOPTED SUBJECT

APPENDIX TO CODE OF ORDINANCES
USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
   1.   OFFICIAL COPY.
The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be kept by the City Clerk
and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
   2.   DISTRIBUTION.
Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made available to all persons
having a relatively frequent and continuing need to have access to ordinances
which are in effect in the City as well as reference centers such as the City
Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
   3.   SALE.
The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not recommended as
experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to result in
outdated codes being used or misused.
   4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION.
The City Clerk should be responsible for maintaining an accurate and current
record of persons having a copy of the Code of Ordinances. Each official,
elected or appointed, should return to the City, upon leaving office, all
documents, records and other materials pertaining to the office, including this
Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances;
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
